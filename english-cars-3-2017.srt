1
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:52,886
<i>Okay, here we go. Focus. Speed.
I am speed.</i>

2
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:59,893
<i>One winner, 42 losers.
I eat losers for breakfast.</i>

3
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:03,564
<i>Did I used to say that?</i>

4
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,649
Yes, sir, you did.

5
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:09,528
You used to say that all the time.
Mater, what are you doing in here?

6
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:11,697
Well, I didn't want you to be lonely.

7
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:17,202
Thank you. But I'm kind of preparing
for a race. I need a little quiet.

8
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,246
Right. You got it, buddy.

9
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,708
Hey, everybody, listen up.

10
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:27,337
My best friend, lightning McQueen,
needs quiet. Perfect quiet!

11
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:30,799
Okay. Where was I?

12
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:35,304
Racing. Real racing.

13
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:41,476
That ain't racing. That wasn't even
a Sunday drive. That was one lap.

14
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:44,813
Racing is 500 of those.
Everybody fighting to move up.

15
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,942
Lap after lap. Inside, outside,
inches apart. Never touching.

16
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:54,698
Now that's racing.
Well, I can't argue with the doc Hudson.

17
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,200
How true, how true.

18
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:01,204
Hey, lightning, you ready?

19
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,707
Yeah. Lightning's ready.

20
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:08,670
This one's for you, doc.

21
00:02:28,055 --> 00:02:29,139
Come on, stickers.

22
00:02:29,306 --> 00:02:32,559
Pardon me. Excuse me.
Best friend coming through. Go, McQueen!

23
00:02:33,811 --> 00:02:37,106
Pass him now, 24!
Lightning McQueen!

24
00:02:39,817 --> 00:02:41,694
Go, 95!

25
00:02:43,608 --> 00:02:45,819
Hey, Cal, your blinker's on.

26
00:02:45,986 --> 00:02:49,781
What? No, it's not.
Hey! Your blinker's on.

27
00:02:49,948 --> 00:02:51,074
Good comeback, Cal.

28
00:02:51,741 --> 00:02:55,162
<i>Because I want to run that race</i>

29
00:02:55,787 --> 00:02:58,874
<i>I want to run that race</i>

30
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:02,544
<i>I do it at my pace</i>

31
00:03:06,339 --> 00:03:09,593
<i>into the pit goes lightning McQueen,
Bobby swift and Cal weathers.</i>

32
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:11,887
These three are fun to watch,
aren't they, Darrell?

33
00:03:12,053 --> 00:03:14,806
You know, Bob, I can't tell
if they have more fun on or off the track.

34
00:03:16,975 --> 00:03:18,351
<i>Finito! Via, via, via, via.</i>

35
00:03:19,352 --> 00:03:21,313
You getting a car wash too, Cal?

36
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,107
No, you're getting a car wash, McQueen.

37
00:03:24,274 --> 00:03:25,400
Good comeback, Cal.

38
00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:28,528
<i>We gotta run that race</i>

39
00:03:29,029 --> 00:03:31,907
<i>we gotta run that race</i>

40
00:03:32,616 --> 00:03:35,410
<i>we do it at our pace</i>

41
00:03:35,911 --> 00:03:39,831
<i>long as we get to run that race
hey, hey, hey, hey</i>

42
00:03:40,114 --> 00:03:43,492
lightning, how do you keep your focus
racing against Bobby and Cal?

43
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:47,621
I think the key is we respect each other.
These guys are real class acts...

44
00:03:48,956 --> 00:03:50,707
congratulations, cupcake.

45
00:03:52,042 --> 00:03:53,418
They are gonna pay.

46
00:04:02,134 --> 00:04:04,136
Go, dinoco!

47
00:04:04,428 --> 00:04:05,513
Great win today, Cal.

48
00:04:05,721 --> 00:04:10,726
Thank you, Shannon. It was
a great boost and I was... hey! Guido!

49
00:04:10,893 --> 00:04:14,105
Pit stop.
Ha, ha. Laugh it up. Real funny.

50
00:04:21,362 --> 00:04:22,280
<i>Andiamo! Andiamo!</i>

51
00:04:22,446 --> 00:04:23,823
Keep it going, buddy!

52
00:04:29,986 --> 00:04:31,988
We're gonna have to load them
for the next town. Don't you let...

53
00:04:32,363 --> 00:04:35,908
hey! Are my sponsors happy today?

54
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:39,370
Stop winning for crying out loud.
We're running out of bumper cream to sell.

55
00:04:40,037 --> 00:04:41,414
Lightning McQueen!

56
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:44,041
Hey, big Tex.
How's my favorite competitor?

57
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:45,334
Just say the word and...

58
00:04:45,501 --> 00:04:48,212
I'll boot Cal off the dinoco team
and replace him with you.

59
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:50,965
You know I can hear you, right?
I'm right here.

60
00:04:51,132 --> 00:04:54,552
Bye, Cal. See you next week. Or not.

61
00:04:55,052 --> 00:04:57,054
Come on now. I'm joking.

62
00:04:57,383 --> 00:05:01,512
Go, little buddy! And big buddy too!

63
00:05:05,975 --> 00:05:09,353
<i>Another great finish in the making.
McQueen and swift nose to nose.</i>

64
00:05:09,645 --> 00:05:11,355
How's the view back there, Bobby?

65
00:05:11,522 --> 00:05:13,899
Well, you better not blink.
I'll blow right past you.

66
00:05:14,191 --> 00:05:17,695
<i>The flag is out. It's the final stretch.
McQueen in the lead.</i>

67
00:05:19,321 --> 00:05:20,990
Okay, let's see what you got.

68
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:31,500
<i>Holy cow!</i>

69
00:05:32,501 --> 00:05:35,212
<i>It's Jackson storm for the win.
A huge upset!</i>

70
00:05:35,379 --> 00:05:37,298
<i>Neither lightning nor Bobby
ever saw him coming.</i>

71
00:05:37,631 --> 00:05:41,510
<i>It's one thing to start fast, but we
haven't seen anyone cross the line...</i>

72
00:05:41,677 --> 00:05:44,638
<i>With that kind of speed and power
since a young...</i>

73
00:05:44,722 --> 00:05:46,891
<i>Lightning McQueen first arrived
on the scene.</i>

74
00:05:47,057 --> 00:05:51,562
Hey, Bobby? Who is that?
That's Jackson storm.

75
00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:53,230
Yeah. He's one of the rookies.

76
00:05:56,358 --> 00:05:59,945
Thank you, guys. Thank you.
No, I appreciate it. Thank you very much.

77
00:06:01,197 --> 00:06:04,909
Hey. Jackson storm, right?
Great race today.

78
00:06:05,493 --> 00:06:06,702
Thank you, Mr. McQueen.

79
00:06:06,869 --> 00:06:10,289
You have no idea what a pleasure it is
for me to finally beat you.

80
00:06:10,456 --> 00:06:15,252
Thanks. Wait. Hang on.
Did you say "meet" or "beat"?

81
00:06:16,462 --> 00:06:19,048
I think you heard me.
What?

82
00:06:19,256 --> 00:06:20,508
Storm, can we get some pictures?

83
00:06:20,591 --> 00:06:22,259
Yeah, yeah. Come on. Let's get a picture.
You know what?

84
00:06:22,426 --> 00:06:26,013
Get a ton of pictures because champ here
has been a role model of mine...

85
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:31,352
For years now. And I mean a lot of years.
Right? I love this guy.

86
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:35,689
Storm, give us a quote.
What's your top speed?

87
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,566
I think I touched a nerve.

88
00:06:47,322 --> 00:06:49,867
Welcome back to chick's picks
with chick Hicks.

89
00:06:50,033 --> 00:06:54,288
I'm your host, former and forever,
piston cup champion, chick Hicks.

90
00:06:55,497 --> 00:06:56,248
This just in:

91
00:06:56,415 --> 00:07:00,377
Rookie Jackson storm slams
the proverbial door on lightning McQueen.

92
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,882
I couldn't have enjoyed it more
if I'd beaten McQueen myself.

93
00:07:05,048 --> 00:07:08,886
Wait, I have. But enough about me.

94
00:07:09,052 --> 00:07:11,555
Here to tell you how it happened
is professional number...

95
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,599
Cruncher miss Natalie certain.

96
00:07:13,765 --> 00:07:15,184
It's a pleasure to be here, chick.

97
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:18,437
And actually,
I prefer the term "statistical analyst".

98
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:22,733
Right. So, who is this mysterious
newcomer, Jackson storm?

99
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,485
And why is he so darn fast?

100
00:07:24,651 --> 00:07:27,154
It's no mystery
if you study the data, Mr. Hicks.

101
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:31,283
Jackson storm is part of
the next generation of hightech racers.

102
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,327
Unlike the veterans of yesterday...

103
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:35,370
what? Oldtimers like this guy?

104
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:41,710
Right. Storm achieves his top speeds
by exploiting the numbers.

105
00:07:41,877 --> 00:07:43,962
I refer, of course, to racing data.

106
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:47,549
Tire pressure, downforce, weight
distribution, aerodynamics, and...

107
00:07:47,716 --> 00:07:50,427
Nextgens like storm
are taking advantage.

108
00:07:50,966 --> 00:07:52,802
The racing world is changing.

109
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:56,305
And for the better if it means my old pal,
lightning, is down for the count.

110
00:07:56,472 --> 00:07:57,390
Am I right, certain?

111
00:07:57,556 --> 00:07:59,850
Well, if I'm certain of anything, chick...

112
00:08:00,017 --> 00:08:03,479
It's that this season
is about to get even more interesting.

113
00:08:05,022 --> 00:08:08,317
<i>I'll tell you what, Darrell, Jackson
storm has certainly made an impact.</i>

114
00:08:08,484 --> 00:08:11,779
<i>We've got six more nextgeneration
rookies in the field.</i>

115
00:08:11,946 --> 00:08:14,031
<i>With six veterans fired to clear the way.</i>

116
00:08:14,198 --> 00:08:16,659
Morning, champ.
How's our living legend today?

117
00:08:17,993 --> 00:08:20,663
Still very much alive, thank you.
And I would appreciate...

118
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,582
you know, I can't believe I get to race
the lightning McQueen.

119
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:25,960
In his farewell season.
What are you talking about?

120
00:08:26,627 --> 00:08:30,464
Green flag. Good luck out there, champ.
You're gonna need it.

121
00:08:37,513 --> 00:08:40,558
<i>One reason storm and the nextgens
are more efficient:</i>

122
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,302
Their ability to hold the optimum
racing line every single lap.

123
00:08:44,385 --> 00:08:46,721
<i>Win number three
for the rookie sensation.</i>

124
00:08:46,929 --> 00:08:49,932
<i>Storm's in a class of his own.
And a big reason for that:</i>

125
00:08:50,099 --> 00:08:53,895
<i>Training on the newest cuttingedge
simulators. These machines create</i> a...

126
00:08:53,978 --> 00:08:57,857
<i>Virtual racing experience so real
racers never even have to go outside.</i>

127
00:08:58,983 --> 00:09:01,777
<i>Storm's ability to hold that line
is like nothing we've ever seen.</i>

128
00:09:02,191 --> 00:09:04,151
<i>Four in a row? Are you kidding me?</i>

129
00:09:04,234 --> 00:09:06,320
<i>2% lower drag coefficient.</i>

130
00:09:06,403 --> 00:09:09,364
<i>What a finish!
5% increase downforce.</i>

131
00:09:09,698 --> 00:09:13,077
<i>Lucky number seven.</i>
1.2% higher <i>top speed.</i>

132
00:09:13,577 --> 00:09:14,953
<i>Amazing! Nine!</i>

133
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:19,249
<i>Piston cup winner, chick Hicks here
with the racer taking the circuit...</i>

134
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:21,251
<i>By storm. Jackson storm.</i>

135
00:09:21,418 --> 00:09:25,297
<i>Another easy win over old "kachow".
Or should I say, "caboose"?</i>

136
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:27,549
<i>Because he's always in the back.
Am I right?</i>

137
00:09:27,716 --> 00:09:30,594
<i>No, no, no, chick.
McQueen is a crafty veteran champ.</i>

138
00:09:30,844 --> 00:09:32,930
<i>He's the elder statesman of the sport.
You know?</i>

139
00:09:33,097 --> 00:09:35,516
<i>Takes everything I got to beat him.</i>

140
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:38,393
You got to be kidding me.

141
00:09:39,728 --> 00:09:42,689
What changes are you gonna make
to get McQueen back on top?

142
00:09:42,856 --> 00:09:45,275
Will McQueen try new training methods?
Ls he prepared to retire?

143
00:09:45,442 --> 00:09:48,654
Come on, guys. Let's not overreact.
It's just a slump.

144
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:52,366
We'll get 'em next week.
Okay, that's enough. No comment.

145
00:09:52,449 --> 00:09:55,035
Not even about weathers retiring?
Wait. What?

146
00:09:55,202 --> 00:09:57,246
Cal weathers.
He's hanging up his lightyears.

147
00:09:59,373 --> 00:10:01,792
No. No comment on that either.

148
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:03,752
Wait a minute. Please, come on.
You got to give us something.

149
00:10:07,131 --> 00:10:12,427
Hey, Cal! Hey.
Retirement? What's going on?

150
00:10:14,721 --> 00:10:18,016
You know, I asked my uncle once
how I'd know when it was time to stop.

151
00:10:18,767 --> 00:10:22,729
You know what he said?
The youngsters will tell you.

152
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,948
We had some good times together.
I'm gonna miss that the most I think.

153
00:10:34,575 --> 00:10:35,826
Yeah.

154
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,251
<i>More changes ahead, chick.</i>

155
00:10:44,334 --> 00:10:47,462
Every week we've seen
veteran racers either retire...

156
00:10:47,629 --> 00:10:51,425
Like Cal weathers tonight,
or fired to make room for these younger...

157
00:10:51,592 --> 00:10:54,761
Faster racers. And, it's not over yet.

158
00:10:55,095 --> 00:10:59,558
<i>Hello racing fans.
Welcome to the Los Angeles 500.</i>

159
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:04,188
<i>The final race of the piston cup season.
It's been a year of surprises...</i>

160
00:11:04,354 --> 00:11:07,107
they can't do this.
I've raced for you guys almost 10 years.

161
00:11:07,274 --> 00:11:11,403
Sorry, brick. My mind's made up.
I'm giving your number to someone new.

162
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,113
Hey, I had two wins last year!

163
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,699
The whole sport's changing.
I'm just doing what I got to do.

164
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:22,623
Do you know what's happening with brick...
wait, you're not Bobby.

165
00:11:24,124 --> 00:11:25,459
The name's Danny, bro.

166
00:11:37,387 --> 00:11:40,224
Hey, champ, where'd all your friends go?

167
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:46,104
<i>A final check of his tires
as storm settles into the pole position.</i>

168
00:11:46,271 --> 00:11:50,067
<i>Boogity, boogity, boogity.
Let's end this season with a great race.</i>

169
00:12:05,874 --> 00:12:07,125
That's it, buddy!

170
00:12:17,511 --> 00:12:19,304
<i>Forty laps to go
and race leader, Jackson storm...</i>

171
00:12:19,721 --> 00:12:22,599
<i>Is making his way onto pit road
with McQueen on his tail.</i>

172
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:26,478
<i>A good stop here could mean
the difference between victory and defeat.</i>

173
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:29,356
Come on, come on. Come on!
Faster, guido, come on.

174
00:12:29,523 --> 00:12:32,526
I got to get back out there before
he does. Guido, hurry up!

175
00:12:33,026 --> 00:12:33,986
<i>Fatto, fatto.</i>

176
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:39,491
<i>What a pit stop by McQueen!
Man, he just got the lead!</i>

177
00:12:39,908 --> 00:12:41,285
<i>But can he hold on to it?</i>

178
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:50,627
Hey, McQueen, are you all right?
Listen, don't you worry, pal.

179
00:12:50,794 --> 00:12:53,672
You had a good run. Enjoy your retirement!

180
00:12:54,381 --> 00:12:55,382
<i>Storm takes back the lead!</i>

181
00:12:55,549 --> 00:13:00,804
<i>Unbelievable! McQueen is fading!
McQueen is fading! Fading fast!</i>

182
00:13:01,513 --> 00:13:05,142
No.No!No!No!

183
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:07,644
No!

184
00:14:02,064 --> 00:14:03,691
<i>Whlz</i>

185
00:14:03,858 --> 00:14:05,317
<i>welcome back to piston cup talk.</i>

186
00:14:05,484 --> 00:14:09,321
<i>Around the clock where we do nothing
but talk racing. Let's get to it.</i>

187
00:14:09,572 --> 00:14:11,574
<i>Starting of course with lightning McQueen.</i>

188
00:14:12,032 --> 00:14:15,870
<i>With the season just two weeks away,
there's still no official announcement.</i>

189
00:14:16,036 --> 00:14:19,206
<i>But with number 95 coming off
his worst year on record...</i>

190
00:14:19,373 --> 00:14:21,834
<i>don't shoot the messenger here, folks.
I think it's safe to assume...</i>

191
00:14:22,703 --> 00:14:25,330
<i>That lightning McQueen's
racing days are over.</i>

192
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:28,625
<i>Meanwhile, Jackson storm
is looking even faster...</i>

193
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:36,383
<i>for the checkered flag.</i>

194
00:14:36,884 --> 00:14:39,887
<i>As they enter the final lap,
the number 6 and number 12 cars...</i>

195
00:14:40,053 --> 00:14:44,016
<i>Are still fighting it out for the lead.
But wait! Here he comes!</i>

196
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:47,186
<i>It's the fabulous Hudson hornet
knocking at their door.</i>

197
00:14:47,394 --> 00:14:51,565
<i>What's he got up his sleeve today?
And there it is!</i>

198
00:14:51,732 --> 00:14:56,403
<i>With one move, he's past them.
The hornet takes a decisive lead.</i>

199
00:14:58,739 --> 00:15:02,534
<i>He's left the pack behind.
His crew chief, smokey, is loving it!</i>

200
00:15:02,743 --> 00:15:06,079
<i>It's unbelievable! No! He's in trouble!</i>

201
00:15:06,246 --> 00:15:11,376
<i>The Hudson hornet has lost control!</i>

202
00:15:14,254 --> 00:15:18,258
<i>What should have been a scene
of jubilation has turned tragic, folks.</i>

203
00:15:18,425 --> 00:15:20,928
<i>As we await news
on the Hudson hornet's condition.</i>

204
00:15:21,094 --> 00:15:23,180
<i>After such a devastating crash...</i>

205
00:15:23,347 --> 00:15:26,767
<i>We can only hope that
this race today wasn't his last.</i>

206
00:15:32,934 --> 00:15:36,104
<i>When I finally got put together,
I went back expecting a big welcome.</i>

207
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:39,732
You know what they said? You're history.

208
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:42,777
Moved right on to the next rookie
standing in line.

209
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:49,075
There was a lot left in me
I never got a chance to show.

210
00:16:07,135 --> 00:16:08,386
Hey, stickers.

211
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:10,263
Hey, sal.

212
00:16:10,972 --> 00:16:12,306
How you feeling?

213
00:16:13,474 --> 00:16:17,520
Yeah, great. Really, really great.

214
00:16:18,646 --> 00:16:20,106
Been thinking about doc again?

215
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:26,279
Yeah. You know they told him
when he was done.

216
00:16:27,447 --> 00:16:28,656
He didn't decide.

217
00:16:29,991 --> 00:16:33,411
I don't want what happened to doc
to happen to me.

218
00:16:33,911 --> 00:16:35,079
But that hasn't happened.

219
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:40,710
No, but I can't go out on the track
and do the same old thing. It won't work.

220
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,004
Then change it up! Try something new.

221
00:16:43,671 --> 00:16:46,758
I don't know, Sally. I...
don't fear failure.

222
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:51,345
Be afraid of not having the chance.
You have the chance. Doc didn't.

223
00:16:51,763 --> 00:16:55,850
And you can either take it or you can
do what you been doing. Sitting.

224
00:16:56,017 --> 00:17:00,938
In here. For months. And by the way,
I love what you've done with the place.

225
00:17:01,105 --> 00:17:04,776
I mean the monster movie lighting
and the musky air freshener.

226
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:08,780
Don't let anyone tell you
you're not working that primer because...

227
00:17:08,946 --> 00:17:10,823
I have never found you more attractive.

228
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:14,035
And now that I've been in here
for a couple minutes, the stench...

229
00:17:14,202 --> 00:17:17,705
I'm getting kind of used to it.
Okay, sal. I get it. I get it.

230
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:21,793
I miss you, lightning. We all do.

231
00:17:27,215 --> 00:17:28,883
Try something new, huh?

232
00:17:30,885 --> 00:17:32,261
Hey, did it work, miss Sally?

233
00:17:32,428 --> 00:17:35,723
Did you set him straight
with your lawyerly powers of persuasion?

234
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,600
Is he ready to start training?

235
00:17:37,725 --> 00:17:39,769
Well, stinky...
stickers?

236
00:17:41,687 --> 00:17:43,898
Yes, mater, I am.

237
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,819
I decide when I'm done.

238
00:17:48,486 --> 00:17:51,447
I was hoping you'd say that.
Okay, but I got an idea.

239
00:17:51,614 --> 00:17:53,574
And I'm gonna need to talk to rusty
and dusty, all right?

240
00:17:54,033 --> 00:17:57,245
I'll get them on the horn.
Get it? On the horn?

241
00:17:59,247 --> 00:18:01,624
Oops. Hold on. Got to sneeze.

242
00:18:06,754 --> 00:18:09,423
Dadgum, I lost it.
Hey, I'll see you at flo's.

243
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:12,760
I found it.

244
00:18:12,927 --> 00:18:14,387
Hey, watch your step.

245
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:18,090
<i>What about the car from Everett?
Remember him?</i>

246
00:18:18,256 --> 00:18:22,260
<i>He was stuck in reverse! I said, you
need a house with a circular driveway!</i>

247
00:18:23,261 --> 00:18:27,599
You need to get your rusty tails down
here. I created a drink in your honor.

248
00:18:27,766 --> 00:18:30,602
Yeah! The rusteze medicated
bumper bomb.

249
00:18:30,769 --> 00:18:33,605
It goes down faster than an elevator
full of winnebagos.

250
00:18:33,772 --> 00:18:36,608
Rusty and dusty!
Well, look who's here.

251
00:18:37,109 --> 00:18:39,236
<i>There he is! Good to see you, lightning!</i>

252
00:18:39,444 --> 00:18:42,239
Thanks, guys. You're all here.

253
00:18:42,447 --> 00:18:44,908
Sorry, buddy,
did you want this call to be private?

254
00:18:45,075 --> 00:18:49,955
No, mater. This is perfect. Listen,
thanks, everyone, for sticking by me.

255
00:18:50,122 --> 00:18:53,333
It took me a while to figure it out,
but I know now that it's time...

256
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,377
For me to make some changes.

257
00:18:55,627 --> 00:19:00,132
Changes? What kind of changes?
It's futile to resist change, man.

258
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,300
You're right, Fillmore.
Really?

259
00:19:02,467 --> 00:19:04,928
Which is why
I have an announcement to make.

260
00:19:05,095 --> 00:19:07,931
I've thought long and hard about it.

261
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:11,768
Done a lot of soulsearching
and considered all of the options.

262
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:14,980
And I've finally decided...

263
00:19:16,314 --> 00:19:18,024
You do want to keep racing?

264
00:19:18,275 --> 00:19:20,443
Are you kidding?
Of course I want to keep racing!

265
00:19:20,652 --> 00:19:22,821
Thank goodness!
Glad to hear it. All right.

266
00:19:23,071 --> 00:19:26,741
Man, for a second I...
wait a minute. I knew that the whole time.

267
00:19:26,825 --> 00:19:29,369
Guys! I'm talking about
making this my best season yet!

268
00:19:29,452 --> 00:19:31,163
<i>We were hoping you'd say that.</i>

269
00:19:31,621 --> 00:19:34,958
The thing is, if I'm gonna be faster than
storm, I need to train like him.

270
00:19:35,167 --> 00:19:36,334
<i>We're way ahead of you, buddy!</i>

271
00:19:36,501 --> 00:19:39,171
<i>Lightning, we want you on the road
first thing in the morning...</i>

272
00:19:39,337 --> 00:19:41,965
<i>So you can come out
and see the brandnew...</i>

273
00:19:42,132 --> 00:19:44,634
<i>Rusteze racing center!</i>

274
00:19:44,801 --> 00:19:48,180
<i>It's wicked</i> awesome.
What? Rusteze racing center?

275
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:52,517
<i>It's got all the fancy bells and whistles
that kids are training on these days.</i>

276
00:19:52,684 --> 00:19:56,188
<i>We'll send macky boy all the directions.
Now get moving, all right?</i>

277
00:19:56,897 --> 00:19:58,732
Qkay! Yes!

278
00:19:58,899 --> 00:20:01,526
Fancy new training center?
That sounds nice!

279
00:20:01,693 --> 00:20:03,862
Guido, come! We have to pack the tires!

280
00:20:04,029 --> 00:20:08,033
Hey, McQueen! You can't race
in primer, man. Come on! Let's go.

281
00:20:12,204 --> 00:20:14,331
Ramone, you have done it again.

282
00:20:14,497 --> 00:20:18,084
It's like the sistine chapel on wheels.

283
00:20:18,752 --> 00:20:20,712
I'm coming for you, storm.

284
00:20:22,714 --> 00:20:25,383
Morning, McQueen! Hey, look at you.

285
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,010
He looks so good!

286
00:20:28,678 --> 00:20:31,598
Welcome back. You look different.

287
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:34,434
Obviously.
You look ready.

288
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:37,062
Guido, come! <i>Scusi, scusi.</i>
Tires coming through.

289
00:20:37,229 --> 00:20:39,898
Go kick those rookies in the trunk.

290
00:20:40,065 --> 00:20:41,524
All right, bye.

291
00:20:41,691 --> 00:20:44,194
Catch you on the flipside.
I'll see you guys in Florida.

292
00:20:44,402 --> 00:20:46,613
See you, McQueen.
Don't forget to call me.

293
00:20:46,988 --> 00:20:48,114
Good luck in college.

294
00:20:49,616 --> 00:20:53,703
Hey, sal. Thanks.
Anytime.

295
00:20:54,738 --> 00:20:56,865
Love you!
Love you more.

296
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:02,579
Rusteze racing center, here we come!
Good times ahead.

297
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:11,421
<i>When the time gets right</i>

298
00:21:12,881 --> 00:21:14,883
<i>I'm gonna pick you up</i>

299
00:21:16,217 --> 00:21:18,511
<i>and take you far away from</i>

300
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:21,806
<i>from trouble, my love</i>

301
00:21:23,308 --> 00:21:25,268
<i>under a big old sky</i>

302
00:21:26,936 --> 00:21:29,063
<i>out in a field of green</i>

303
00:21:31,107 --> 00:21:33,401
<i>there's got to be something</i>

304
00:21:34,402 --> 00:21:36,571
<i>left for us to believe</i>

305
00:21:37,906 --> 00:21:40,909
<i>oh, I await the day</i>

306
00:21:41,493 --> 00:21:44,621
<i>good fortune comes our way</i>

307
00:21:44,954 --> 00:21:48,082
<i>and we'll ride down the king's highway</i>

308
00:21:48,249 --> 00:21:51,628
<i>yeah, yeah
yeah</i>

309
00:22:09,312 --> 00:22:12,106
McQueen, over here!
McQueen, how you feeling?

310
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,817
Have you seen the latest records
storm's been setting?

311
00:22:14,025 --> 00:22:15,485
Have you given any thought to retirement?

312
00:22:16,152 --> 00:22:19,322
Okay, that's enough. No questions!
Scusi. Out of the way!

313
00:22:19,656 --> 00:22:21,991
Coming through! Okay, back up. Back up!
No pictures. No, no, no.

314
00:22:24,281 --> 00:22:26,158
Okay, thank you. Byebye.

315
00:22:27,492 --> 00:22:30,329
Guido, can you believe them?
Paparazzi.

316
00:22:44,176 --> 00:22:45,552
Looks good, doesn't it?

317
00:22:45,719 --> 00:22:47,554
Hey, guys.
What do you think?

318
00:22:48,013 --> 00:22:50,015
What do I think? It's unbelievable.

319
00:22:50,182 --> 00:22:54,019
Yeah, you know, it's kind of a cozy,
humble, little place.

320
00:22:54,186 --> 00:22:56,188
Guys, how did you ever do this?

321
00:22:56,355 --> 00:22:58,815
You want to tell him or should I?
No, you start. Go ahead.

322
00:22:59,358 --> 00:23:01,568
We sold rusteze.

323
00:23:02,861 --> 00:23:03,820
What?

324
00:23:04,029 --> 00:23:07,074
What? You think a couple ofjabronis
like us could do this on our own?

325
00:23:07,366 --> 00:23:09,493
Wait. You sold rusteze?
It's all good news.

326
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:13,372
We just realized that you needed
something that we couldn't give you.

327
00:23:13,538 --> 00:23:15,874
It felt like
the time was right for us too.

328
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:17,709
I mean, we're not as young and handsome
as we look.

329
00:23:18,377 --> 00:23:19,378
That's true.

330
00:23:19,628 --> 00:23:23,632
Besides, this Sterling fellow? He's got
every hightech thing you'll ever need.

331
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:26,218
Everything we wanted to give you,
but couldn't.

332
00:23:27,052 --> 00:23:28,887
Sterling? Who's Sterling?

333
00:23:29,054 --> 00:23:32,557
Lightning McQueen!
You made some serious time, partner.

334
00:23:32,891 --> 00:23:37,479
Your new sponsor. He's the
mudflap king of the eastern seaboard.

335
00:23:37,729 --> 00:23:40,232
Welcome to
the rusteze racing center!

336
00:23:40,399 --> 00:23:44,236
You have no idea how much
I've been looking forward to this.

337
00:23:44,403 --> 00:23:48,031
Thanks, Mr...
please. No "mister". Just Sterling.

338
00:23:48,198 --> 00:23:51,076
I have been a fan of yours forever.
And to be your sponsor?

339
00:23:51,243 --> 00:23:54,246
How great is that?
I can't thank rusty and dusty here enough.

340
00:23:54,413 --> 00:23:55,914
Tough negotiators by the way.

341
00:23:56,081 --> 00:23:58,083
You flatter us, but don't stop!

342
00:23:58,834 --> 00:24:03,088
Anyway, just wanted to say a quick hello.
Take as much time as you need.

343
00:24:03,255 --> 00:24:04,506
Door's always open, guys.

344
00:24:07,259 --> 00:24:08,427
See?

345
00:24:17,892 --> 00:24:21,354
I sure am gonna miss racing for you guys.

346
00:24:23,398 --> 00:24:26,776
You know, you gave us
a lot of great memories, lightning.

347
00:24:27,443 --> 00:24:29,278
Memories we'll remember.

348
00:24:30,571 --> 00:24:31,572
That's good.

349
00:24:33,282 --> 00:24:36,536
Hey, lightning, whatever you do...
don't drive like my brother!

350
00:24:36,703 --> 00:24:39,747
Don't drive like my brother.
Please no pictures.

351
00:24:39,914 --> 00:24:42,041
Okay, maybe one.
Get my good side though, will you?

352
00:25:06,399 --> 00:25:08,151
So? You like it?

353
00:25:08,401 --> 00:25:13,990
Hey, Mr. Sterling.
My career on a wall.

354
00:25:15,324 --> 00:25:16,993
Nice that you included doc.

355
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,579
Of course. He was your mentor.

356
00:25:20,455 --> 00:25:22,957
Losing him left a giant hole in the sport.

357
00:25:24,292 --> 00:25:28,171
Yeah. Jars of dirt?

358
00:25:28,337 --> 00:25:29,797
Sacred dirt.

359
00:25:30,089 --> 00:25:33,509
Each of those jars contains dirt
from all the old tracks that doc raced on.

360
00:25:33,676 --> 00:25:37,305
Florida international, thunder hollow,
just down the road and...

361
00:25:37,472 --> 00:25:40,266
Our very own fireball beach,
right outside.

362
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,434
Hey, is that...

363
00:25:43,601 --> 00:25:45,186
a bit of asphalt from Glen Ellen.

364
00:25:45,353 --> 00:25:49,607
My first win! You really are a fan.

365
00:25:49,816 --> 00:25:54,821
I am. And a fan of your future.
You ready for it?

366
00:25:56,489 --> 00:25:57,824
Definitely.

367
00:25:58,491 --> 00:26:01,536
First, let's get you into a more...
Contemporary look.

368
00:26:12,463 --> 00:26:13,715
<i>It's an electronic suit.</i>

369
00:26:13,881 --> 00:26:16,843
<i>With it we'll be able to track your speed
and your vital signs.</i>

370
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:17,969
Does it have a phone?

371
00:26:18,219 --> 00:26:21,014
<i>Don't be crazy.
Racecars don't have phones.</i>

372
00:26:23,641 --> 00:26:26,311
Not bad, huh?
This is really impressive.

373
00:26:26,436 --> 00:26:29,522
This center has quickly become
the most coveted destination...

374
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:31,649
For young racers training
to make our team someday.

375
00:26:31,733 --> 00:26:34,652
And it's where you'll train
until you leave for Florida.

376
00:26:34,861 --> 00:26:38,406
Treadmills, wind tunnels, virtual reality.

377
00:26:40,074 --> 00:26:41,367
Still working on that.

378
00:26:41,534 --> 00:26:44,912
And the best fitness regimen
anyone could possibly imagine.

379
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:49,125
Wait. Wait.
Is that the simulator?

380
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:50,418
Yes.

381
00:26:50,585 --> 00:26:53,755
Lightning, I'd like to introduce you
to the multimillion dollar...

382
00:26:54,255 --> 00:26:56,424
Flagship of interactive race simulation.

383
00:26:57,091 --> 00:27:01,262
The xdl 24gts mark z.

384
00:27:01,763 --> 00:27:06,267
The xdl... etcetera.

385
00:27:06,434 --> 00:27:09,062
Jackson storm wishes he had this model.

386
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:18,321
That was amazing.
Awesome. Yeah!

387
00:27:18,571 --> 00:27:21,115
It's just like being on a real track,
so put your hours in.

388
00:27:21,282 --> 00:27:24,619
Okay, let's hit the treadmills.
Come on. Show me what you got!

389
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:29,791
Pretty fast. Who's the racer?
No. She's not a racer. She's a trainer.

390
00:27:29,874 --> 00:27:33,211
Cruz Ramirez.
The best trainer in the business.

391
00:27:33,294 --> 00:27:35,380
Ready to meet it, greet it and defeat it?

392
00:27:35,546 --> 00:27:38,424
All right. Now bring up those rpms!

393
00:27:38,549 --> 00:27:40,301
Like the attitude.

394
00:27:40,468 --> 00:27:42,804
Yeah, we call her
our maestro of motivation.

395
00:27:43,221 --> 00:27:44,806
You're driving
a little tense again, Ronald.

396
00:27:45,056 --> 00:27:48,518
No, no. I'm cool. I'm cool.
Do your exercise.

397
00:27:48,935 --> 00:27:54,607
I am a fluffy cloud! I am a fluffy cloud!
I am a fluffy cloud.

398
00:27:54,774 --> 00:27:55,817
There you go!

399
00:27:55,983 --> 00:27:57,735
You're a cloud.
Shut up, Kurt!

400
00:27:57,944 --> 00:27:59,362
Here come the bugs, Kurt. You ready?

401
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:05,159
Hey, I kept my eyes open this time!

402
00:28:05,493 --> 00:28:09,247
Got to see that track.
No. Homesick again, Gabriel?

403
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:10,415
<i>Si.</i>

404
00:28:13,793 --> 00:28:16,003
<i>Santa Cecilia! Mi pueblo!</i>

405
00:28:16,254 --> 00:28:17,296
Win for them!

406
00:28:18,256 --> 00:28:20,591
She trains young racers
to push through their own obstacles.

407
00:28:20,842 --> 00:28:24,595
Tailormade for each one.
Now, she's gonna work with you.

408
00:28:24,846 --> 00:28:27,849
Let's go! Let's go!
You guys got to work through this stuff...

409
00:28:28,015 --> 00:28:30,017
So when your big chance comes along
you can take it.

410
00:28:30,184 --> 00:28:32,854
Hey, Cruz.
Hey, Mr. Sterling!

411
00:28:33,146 --> 00:28:35,690
I'd like to introduce you
to lightning McQueen.

412
00:28:35,857 --> 00:28:37,191
I hear you're the maestro.

413
00:28:37,567 --> 00:28:40,445
Mr. Sterling, did you say lightning
McQueen was here because...

414
00:28:40,611 --> 00:28:42,363
I don't see him anywhere.

415
00:28:42,613 --> 00:28:45,867
But he's right here.
Do you not see him?

416
00:28:46,117 --> 00:28:47,326
Nope, still don't see him.

417
00:28:47,785 --> 00:28:50,830
He's right in front of you!
It's lightning McQueen!

418
00:28:51,122 --> 00:28:56,002
He's obviously an imposter. He looks
old and broken down with flabby tires.

419
00:28:56,169 --> 00:28:57,712
Hey! I do not!
Use that!

420
00:28:59,714 --> 00:29:00,798
Yeah, I see.

421
00:29:00,965 --> 00:29:03,759
I can use that energy
for motivation, right?

422
00:29:04,302 --> 00:29:06,679
It's all about motivation, Mr. McQueen.

423
00:29:06,846 --> 00:29:10,558
You can use anything negative as fuel
to push through to the positive.

424
00:29:10,725 --> 00:29:13,895
I've been pretty positive
ever since I was a rookie.

425
00:29:14,145 --> 00:29:18,232
I am so excited that I get to train you.
I grew up watching you on TV.

426
00:29:19,484 --> 00:29:20,359
Is that right?

427
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:23,279
These young guys are great and all,
but I like a challenge.

428
00:29:23,821 --> 00:29:28,743
I'm not that much older, but...
in fact, I call you my senior project.

429
00:29:31,746 --> 00:29:35,750
We need to loosen those ancient joints.
First the wheels.

430
00:29:35,917 --> 00:29:39,545
And forward, and rest,
and forward, and rest.

431
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:41,964
Join me! Rest. And rest.

432
00:29:42,215 --> 00:29:43,633
Is all this resting necessary?

433
00:29:43,925 --> 00:29:46,594
We're working you in slowly.
And reach for your lunch.

434
00:29:47,094 --> 00:29:51,682
Reach for your lunch.
Now reach, to the front.

435
00:29:51,849 --> 00:29:55,269
What is there? It's your lunch.

436
00:29:55,895 --> 00:29:59,106
Now backwards. Is lunch there?

437
00:29:59,273 --> 00:30:00,399
When do we go on the simulator?

438
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,819
Good morning, Mr. McQueen. Looking good.

439
00:30:05,321 --> 00:30:06,614
Why?

440
00:30:06,864 --> 00:30:10,618
This'll get oil to places it hasn't been
in a long time.

441
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:14,247
Is that a drip pan?
Just in case.

442
00:30:14,413 --> 00:30:15,831
How old do you think I am?

443
00:30:15,915 --> 00:30:20,253
Visualize yourself driving fast down
a steep hill. I'll be back in a few.

444
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:26,259
Visualize... wait. Cruz! A few what?
I just want to go on the simulator.

445
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:28,678
How's it hanging, drip pan?

446
00:30:36,978 --> 00:30:39,438
'Sup.
Okay, day three:

447
00:30:39,605 --> 00:30:43,359
Treadmill. I've set a maximum speed
to conserve your energy.

448
00:30:43,526 --> 00:30:47,113
What I want you to do is
visualize beating this guy.

449
00:30:48,531 --> 00:30:49,991
Storm!
That's right.

450
00:30:50,074 --> 00:30:51,409
Get him! Get him, Mr. McQueen!

451
00:30:51,617 --> 00:30:54,537
Get him? This thing's only going
like 5 miles an hour!

452
00:30:54,745 --> 00:30:57,456
We'll work up to the higher speeds
right after you take your nap.

453
00:30:57,748 --> 00:30:59,584
Nap? I don't need a nap!

454
00:31:01,294 --> 00:31:04,839
Hit him with the bugs!
I am not taking a nap!

455
00:31:05,172 --> 00:31:07,675
<i>All cars in the test bay simulator...</i>

456
00:31:08,384 --> 00:31:10,344
how was your nap, Mr. McQueen?

457
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,180
It was kind of refreshing actually.

458
00:31:14,098 --> 00:31:15,349
Okay, what are you... hey!

459
00:31:15,516 --> 00:31:17,643
You've been driving on tires a long time.

460
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:19,729
Have you ever stopped to get to know them?

461
00:31:20,062 --> 00:31:20,938
I'm sorry, what?

462
00:31:21,105 --> 00:31:24,025
Tires are individuals.
You should give each a name.

463
00:31:24,317 --> 00:31:27,111
Name them? I won't be doing that.

464
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,072
Mine are named Maria, juanita, Ronaldo,
and Debbie Richardson.

465
00:31:30,323 --> 00:31:31,699
What?
Long story.

466
00:31:32,199 --> 00:31:34,285
May I have my tires back
so I can go on the simulator please?

467
00:31:34,452 --> 00:31:35,161
Name them!

468
00:31:35,411 --> 00:31:38,164
Lefty, righty, backy, backy junior. Okay?

469
00:31:38,331 --> 00:31:39,999
Does this make you mad?
Yes, it does!

470
00:31:40,249 --> 00:31:44,545
Use that! And merge, and yield,
and merge, and yield.

471
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:48,633
Beep,beep,beep,beep.
Now you got some tire damage.

472
00:31:49,091 --> 00:31:52,261
Speed bump, speed bump.
Now clean up your messy garage.

473
00:31:52,428 --> 00:31:57,350
Bug in your windshield.
Thank you, Cruz, I'm done.

474
00:31:58,601 --> 00:32:00,269
Mr. McQueen, where are you going?

475
00:32:00,436 --> 00:32:01,604
To the future.

476
00:32:04,315 --> 00:32:08,736
Okay. Here we go.
How do I do this? Come on, baby.

477
00:32:08,903 --> 00:32:09,570
Mr. McQueen...

478
00:32:09,737 --> 00:32:13,115
Cruz, thank you for the oldman training,
as crazy as it was, but I'm...

479
00:32:13,282 --> 00:32:15,701
Warmed up enough
and now I need you to launch this thing.

480
00:32:15,868 --> 00:32:19,246
Wait until you can handle it. Please?
There are no shortcuts.

481
00:32:19,413 --> 00:32:21,082
Okay. We'll just see about that.

482
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:24,168
All right.
My star racer is on the simulator!

483
00:32:24,335 --> 00:32:25,711
Why, yes, I am!

484
00:32:25,961 --> 00:32:28,047
Well, let's see you take it out
for a spin.

485
00:32:28,297 --> 00:32:31,884
Right away, Mr. Sterling,
owner of the company.

486
00:32:34,553 --> 00:32:36,222
Okay. Have fun.

487
00:32:37,973 --> 00:32:41,894
This is what I'm talking about.
Didn't know about those.

488
00:32:42,395 --> 00:32:45,898
<i>Prepare to race. The green flag is out.</i>

489
00:32:45,981 --> 00:32:47,692
I don't see the flag. What do I do?

490
00:32:47,775 --> 00:32:48,859
Go.
Go?

491
00:32:52,405 --> 00:32:53,322
That's sensitive.

492
00:32:54,448 --> 00:32:55,741
<i>You have hit a wall.</i>

493
00:32:55,908 --> 00:32:57,243
It shouldn't be this hard, should it?

494
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:58,327
<i>You have hit a wall.</i>

495
00:32:58,619 --> 00:33:01,372
You're fighting the simulator.
Just race like you always do.

496
00:33:02,123 --> 00:33:03,541
<i>You have hit a wall.</i>

497
00:33:03,708 --> 00:33:05,042
There can't be this many walls
on a regular track!

498
00:33:06,331 --> 00:33:07,915
<i>You have been passed by Jackson storm.</i>

499
00:33:08,291 --> 00:33:10,501
Wait, storm's in here?
For motivation.

500
00:33:10,668 --> 00:33:13,880
Storm races at 207.
Pick it up, Mr. McQueen!

501
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:15,214
I'm trying!

502
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,928
<i>You have hit a wall.</i>

503
00:33:21,095 --> 00:33:23,848
Mr. McQueen, come down from there
and we'll work you up to this.

504
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,559
I am fine, Cruz. I can do it, okay?

505
00:33:29,854 --> 00:33:30,938
<i>You have jumped a barrier.</i>

506
00:33:33,107 --> 00:33:33,775
Sorry!

507
00:33:33,941 --> 00:33:37,278
<i>You have maimed two vehicles.
You have destroyed a drinking fountain.</i>

508
00:33:40,698 --> 00:33:42,283
<i>You have disabled an ambulance.</i>

509
00:33:42,367 --> 00:33:45,953
<i>You are on fire. Danger. Danger.</i>

510
00:33:46,579 --> 00:33:48,289
<i>You are going the wrong way.</i>

511
00:33:48,456 --> 00:33:50,166
Look out! Turn it off!

512
00:33:50,333 --> 00:33:52,293
Get these things off of me!

513
00:33:56,047 --> 00:33:58,424
<i>You have crashed. You have crashed.</i>

514
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:00,958
<i>Are you</i> all <i>right?
You have crashed.</i>

515
00:34:01,709 --> 00:34:02,918
I have crashed.

516
00:34:08,924 --> 00:34:10,801
It's not easy for him.
Cruz, just relax.

517
00:34:11,051 --> 00:34:12,428
Give him another chance.
I will talk to him.

518
00:34:12,594 --> 00:34:15,639
I can still work with him.
I know he's your project.

519
00:34:15,806 --> 00:34:17,099
Are you sure?
Cruz.

520
00:34:17,307 --> 00:34:18,517
Well, can't you just...
Cruz.

521
00:34:18,684 --> 00:34:21,228
It's not easy for him.
Look, I'm trying to help you.

522
00:34:22,563 --> 00:34:24,356
You're all warshed up, McQueen.

523
00:34:24,606 --> 00:34:26,150
I'm sorry. What?

524
00:34:27,484 --> 00:34:29,903
I said,
the floor's all washed up and clean.

525
00:34:30,779 --> 00:34:31,613
Right.

526
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,449
Thank you very much.

527
00:34:34,825 --> 00:34:36,243
Good luck.

528
00:34:37,202 --> 00:34:41,540
Hey, lightning. Come on in.
Got something to show you. You ready?

529
00:34:42,207 --> 00:34:43,250
For what?

530
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:51,958
You are about to become
the biggest brand in racing.

531
00:34:52,125 --> 00:34:56,254
We are talking saturation on all
continents for every demographic.

532
00:34:56,421 --> 00:34:59,549
Movie deals, infomercials,
product endorsements.

533
00:34:59,716 --> 00:35:02,094
Mudflaps?
Of course.

534
00:35:02,219 --> 00:35:05,305
We'll be rich beyond belief.
You think you're famous now?

535
00:35:06,973 --> 00:35:09,226
I thought you'd be mad
about the simulator.

536
00:35:09,392 --> 00:35:12,604
I mean, this is all great, Mr. Sterling,
I guess, but I don't know.

537
00:35:12,771 --> 00:35:14,898
I've never really thought of myself
as a brand.

538
00:35:15,398 --> 00:35:21,071
Nor do I. I'm a fan. Maybe your most avid.
I think of this as your legacy!

539
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,910
It sounds like something that happens
after you're done racing.

540
00:35:30,247 --> 00:35:31,790
Mr. Sterling, what is this about?

541
00:35:32,457 --> 00:35:35,418
Look, lightning. I'm not gonna race you.

542
00:35:35,752 --> 00:35:37,838
What? What do you mean not race me?

543
00:35:38,088 --> 00:35:40,257
Hold on. Hold on.
I'm not going to Florida?

544
00:35:40,423 --> 00:35:45,637
You have no idea how excited I was
to get you here because...

545
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:51,101
I knew you'd be back. It was gonna be
the comeback story of the year!

546
00:35:51,268 --> 00:35:55,689
But your speed and performance
just aren't where they need to be.

547
00:35:56,356 --> 00:35:57,315
I'm sorry.

548
00:35:57,607 --> 00:36:01,153
We're talking about speed on a simulator.

549
00:36:01,319 --> 00:36:03,655
Listen to how crazy that sounds.
Look, I'm trying to help you.

550
00:36:03,822 --> 00:36:07,033
As your sponsor, yes,
but also as your friend.

551
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,287
Your racing days are coming to an end.

552
00:36:10,453 --> 00:36:13,206
Every time you lose, you damage yourself.

553
00:36:13,373 --> 00:36:15,584
Damage the brand, you mean?

554
00:36:16,168 --> 00:36:19,045
Lightning, come on. You've done the work.

555
00:36:19,129 --> 00:36:22,299
Now move on to the next phase
and reap the reward.

556
00:36:22,799 --> 00:36:27,888
The racing is the reward. Not the stuff.
I don't want to cash in.

557
00:36:28,054 --> 00:36:30,307
I want to feel the rush
of moving 200 miles an hour...

558
00:36:30,473 --> 00:36:33,643
Inches from the other guys, pushing myself
faster than I thought I could go!

559
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:36,229
That's the reward, Mr. Sterling!

560
00:36:37,189 --> 00:36:38,273
Lightning, come on.

561
00:36:40,066 --> 00:36:44,988
Look, loan do this. Loan, I promise!
I'll train like I did with doc.

562
00:36:45,155 --> 00:36:48,366
I'll get my tires dirty
on every dirt track from here to Florida.

563
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:52,487
I can start on fireball beach
where all the old greats used to race.

564
00:36:53,154 --> 00:36:56,824
Get your tires dirty. That's how
you're gonna get faster than storm?

565
00:36:56,991 --> 00:37:00,661
Yes! Exactly! I mean, sacred dirt, right?

566
00:37:01,913 --> 00:37:05,666
Mr. Sterling, if you care about
my legacy, the one that doc started,

567
00:37:05,833 --> 00:37:09,212
you'll let me do this.
I promise you, I will win.

568
00:37:09,879 --> 00:37:12,715
I don't know.
What you're asking, it's too risky.

569
00:37:13,007 --> 00:37:15,885
Come on. You like it, I can tell.

570
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:20,098
It's got that little "comeback story
of the year" feel to it, doesn't it?

571
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,436
One race?

572
00:37:28,189 --> 00:37:30,316
If you don't win at Florida,
you'll retire?

573
00:37:30,691 --> 00:37:33,611
Look, if I don't win
I'll sell all the mudflaps you got.

574
00:37:33,778 --> 00:37:38,533
But if I do win,
I decide when I'm done. Deal?

575
00:37:40,535 --> 00:37:41,411
Deal.

576
00:37:42,036 --> 00:37:44,789
Thank you, Mr. Sterling.
You won't be sorry.

577
00:37:44,956 --> 00:37:48,084
Just one thing and this is only because
I don't like taking chances.

578
00:37:48,251 --> 00:37:50,086
You're taking someone with you.

579
00:37:57,635 --> 00:38:00,721
You talked him into it!
Way to go, Mr. McQueen!

580
00:38:01,639 --> 00:38:02,390
Cruz.

581
00:38:02,765 --> 00:38:05,393
You could talk a snowmobile
into an air conditioner.

582
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:07,895
You're going with me? With that thing?

583
00:38:08,104 --> 00:38:12,567
Yeah. You still need my help.
You're brittle like a fossil.

584
00:38:17,155 --> 00:38:20,950
We got the cable.
I don't need a trainer out here, Cruz.

585
00:38:21,576 --> 00:38:24,579
You're old! What if you fall on this beach
and can't get up?

586
00:38:25,121 --> 00:38:28,082
Well, life's a beach and then you drive.

587
00:38:30,084 --> 00:38:32,128
McQueen.
Thank you.

588
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:37,091
This is beautiful. I can see why Mr.
Sterling said you wanted to train here.

589
00:38:37,758 --> 00:38:40,136
As soon as this thing's booted up,
we'll get you on the treadmill...

590
00:38:40,303 --> 00:38:42,597
And I'll track your speed.
What? No!

591
00:38:42,763 --> 00:38:46,601
The whole idea is getting my tires dirty.
Real racing.

592
00:38:46,767 --> 00:38:50,271
I'm not driving on that thing when
I've got the sand and the whole earth.

593
00:38:52,398 --> 00:38:55,109
Okay.
Luigi, let's do this.

594
00:38:55,401 --> 00:38:58,112
Welcome, racers, to fireball beach!

595
00:38:58,279 --> 00:39:01,991
Historic home
for today's great test of speed.

596
00:39:02,158 --> 00:39:06,120
Our finish line will be
the abandoned pier in the distance.

597
00:39:06,621 --> 00:39:11,501
All right. Quicker than quick,
faster than fast, I am speed...

598
00:39:11,667 --> 00:39:15,129
that is great selfmotivation.
Did you come up with that?

599
00:39:15,296 --> 00:39:19,634
Yeah, I did.
On your mark. Get set. Go!

600
00:39:31,604 --> 00:39:37,652
There you go! Felt good!
Hey, what was my speed?

601
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:40,154
I don't know.
I can only track you on the treadmill.

602
00:39:40,655 --> 00:39:41,614
No treadmills!

603
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:44,659
What about Hamilton?
Hamilton here.

604
00:39:44,951 --> 00:39:47,662
Who's Hamilton?
My electronic personal assistant.

605
00:39:47,828 --> 00:39:51,332
You know, like on your phone.
You do have a phone, don't you?

606
00:39:51,541 --> 00:39:54,001
Racecars don't have phones, Cruz.

607
00:39:54,168 --> 00:39:56,671
Hamilton, track Mr. McQueen's speed
and report it.

608
00:39:56,837 --> 00:39:59,215
Tracking.
I'll stay as close as I can.

609
00:39:59,382 --> 00:40:01,342
Your suit will transmit your speeds
to Hamilton.

610
00:40:01,509 --> 00:40:03,803
Fine. Whatever. Let's do this.

611
00:40:05,555 --> 00:40:08,391
Quicker than quick, faster than fast,
I am speed. Come on, Luigi.

612
00:40:08,558 --> 00:40:11,060
On your mark, get set, and go!

613
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:17,233
<i>46 miles per hour. 63 miles. Out of range.</i>

614
00:40:19,443 --> 00:40:21,862
That's odd. I didn't go!

615
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:27,535
On sand you got to ease into your start
so your tires can grab, okay?

616
00:40:27,702 --> 00:40:30,580
Okay.
You do work with racecars, don't you?

617
00:40:30,746 --> 00:40:33,708
Yeah, but never outside.
All right. Let's go again.

618
00:40:33,916 --> 00:40:34,750
Go!

619
00:40:36,711 --> 00:40:42,008
<i>54 miles per hour. 75 miles per hour.
Out of range.</i>

620
00:40:44,427 --> 00:40:47,013
Sorry! Got stuck!

621
00:40:47,513 --> 00:40:49,557
G<> again!
Al'1d go!

622
00:40:50,224 --> 00:40:52,018
Sorryq
60!

623
00:40:53,019 --> 00:40:54,061
Go!

624
00:40:57,523 --> 00:40:58,858
The beach ate me.

625
00:40:59,108 --> 00:41:02,028
All right, Cruz,
pick a line on the compacted sand.

626
00:41:02,194 --> 00:41:05,573
You got to have traction or you're
gonna spin out. Let's do this thing!

627
00:41:05,698 --> 00:41:07,408
On your mark, get set, go!

628
00:41:08,576 --> 00:41:14,165
<i>122 miles per hour. 134 miles...
out of range.</i>

629
00:41:14,749 --> 00:41:17,376
Now what?
I didn't want to hit a crab!

630
00:41:17,585 --> 00:41:20,421
You got to be kidding me.
What? It was cute!

631
00:41:23,883 --> 00:41:26,719
All right, one last chance to try this
before it gets dark.

632
00:41:26,927 --> 00:41:29,930
Now, you're going to take off slow
to let your tires grab.

633
00:41:30,097 --> 00:41:33,434
And pick a straight line on hard sand
so you don't spin out.

634
00:41:33,601 --> 00:41:37,104
And all of the crabbies
have gone nightnight.

635
00:41:37,271 --> 00:41:39,940
Mr. McQueen.
All right. Let's go again.

636
00:41:40,107 --> 00:41:41,442
And go!

637
00:41:44,403 --> 00:41:48,908
<i>150 miles per hour. 175 miles per hour.</i>

638
00:41:49,075 --> 00:41:51,619
<i>196 miles per hour.</i>

639
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:58,918
All right! Finally! You made it!
Congratulations! How'd I do?

640
00:41:59,377 --> 00:42:00,461
You topped out at 198.

641
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:02,296
198? That's it?

642
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:03,881
Still slower than storm.

643
00:42:05,966 --> 00:42:07,385
Wasted my whole day.

644
00:42:07,551 --> 00:42:08,636
I wouldn't say that.

645
00:42:08,803 --> 00:42:12,056
It did feel great to be out here
doing real racing.

646
00:42:12,306 --> 00:42:14,809
This isn't real racing. We're on a beach!

647
00:42:14,975 --> 00:42:17,561
All you do is go straight.
How am I gonna get faster if I don't...

648
00:42:20,815 --> 00:42:26,237
thunder hollow. Thunder hollow!
There's a dirt track there!

649
00:42:26,404 --> 00:42:29,824
That's what I need!
To race against actual racers.

650
00:42:30,449 --> 00:42:35,955
No! Too public! If the press find you,
they will be like many bugs on you.

651
00:42:36,122 --> 00:42:38,666
Paparazzi!
Guys, I really need this!

652
00:42:38,833 --> 00:42:43,462
Just leave it to me, boss.
I am a master of disguise.

653
00:42:53,844 --> 00:42:56,305
All right! Next!

654
00:43:05,606 --> 00:43:09,485
You, sir, are officially incognito.
Nobody's bothering you.

655
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,945
The great lightning McQueen.

656
00:43:12,279 --> 00:43:16,116
I can feel it, guys.
Tonight is the night I find my speed!

657
00:43:16,283 --> 00:43:20,079
<i>Racers, get on over
to the startin' line. Pronto!</i>

658
00:43:21,872 --> 00:43:25,834
All right! No more straight lines.
Just a good oldfashioned oval.

659
00:43:26,205 --> 00:43:27,873
Hey, now! You that outoftowner?

660
00:43:28,165 --> 00:43:31,168
Yes. That's me! Chester whipplefilter.

661
00:43:31,335 --> 00:43:34,130
And I'm Frances beltline.

662
00:43:34,297 --> 00:43:36,215
Cruz, what are you doing?
I'm your trainer.

663
00:43:36,382 --> 00:43:39,218
I'm gonna track your speed
from the infield, whipplefilter.

664
00:43:39,594 --> 00:43:41,429
Fine. Just stay out of the way.

665
00:43:41,596 --> 00:43:44,307
Excuse me, sir?
Where are the other racers?

666
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:50,313
They'll be along. We always
let our guests start right up front.

667
00:43:53,691 --> 00:43:56,360
<i>Welcome, y'all,
to thunder hollow speedway...</i>

668
00:43:57,111 --> 00:44:02,408
<i>For tonight's edition of crazy eight!</i>

669
00:44:12,293 --> 00:44:13,753
Did he say crazy eight?

670
00:44:15,171 --> 00:44:16,213
<i>Race fans!</i>

671
00:44:16,589 --> 00:44:20,134
<i>It's time to meet tonight's challengers!</i>

672
00:44:23,721 --> 00:44:25,264
Have a nice trip!

673
00:44:26,515 --> 00:44:27,975
Protect and swerve!

674
00:44:35,524 --> 00:44:38,444
Cruz! This isn't what I thought it was.
Come on, follow me and we'll slip out.

675
00:44:40,062 --> 00:44:43,607
Rule number one:
The gate closes, you race.

676
00:44:44,232 --> 00:44:46,276
Wait! No, no, no. I'm not a racer.

677
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:49,237
Rule number two:
Last car standing wins.

678
00:44:49,404 --> 00:44:53,116
And rule number three:
No cursing! It's family night.

679
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:56,495
Excuse me, sir?
Wait. No, I'm just a trainer!

680
00:44:59,286 --> 00:45:02,498
<i>And make way for the undefeated
crazy eight champion...</i>

681
00:45:02,873 --> 00:45:07,878
<i>The diva of demolition, miss fritter!</i>

682
00:45:11,215 --> 00:45:12,174
Boo!

683
00:45:13,759 --> 00:45:16,679
Lookie here, boys.
We got us a couple of rookies.

684
00:45:16,846 --> 00:45:21,684
I'm gonna call you muddy britches
and you lemonade.

685
00:45:22,101 --> 00:45:24,395
Hey, neither one of them
has a single dent.

686
00:45:24,562 --> 00:45:26,439
I'm gonna fix that!

687
00:45:26,981 --> 00:45:33,112
<i>All right, everybody! Let's go racing!</i>

688
00:45:38,617 --> 00:45:41,370
I'm about to commit a moving violation.

689
00:45:42,663 --> 00:45:43,330
<i>Boo!</i>

690
00:45:54,049 --> 00:45:54,800
Cruz!

691
00:45:55,509 --> 00:45:56,177
Watch out.

692
00:45:56,802 --> 00:45:59,054
What are you doing? Got to keep moving!

693
00:45:59,221 --> 00:46:00,181
I shouldn't be out here!

694
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:02,683
Move, Cruz! Move!

695
00:46:03,142 --> 00:46:04,643
What do I do? I can't steer!

696
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:05,936
Turn right to go left!
Turn right to go left!

697
00:46:06,353 --> 00:46:08,856
That doesn't make any sense!
Turn right to go left!

698
00:46:15,988 --> 00:46:17,656
Hey, Patty.
Hey, bill!

699
00:46:27,374 --> 00:46:31,045
Look, ma, I can drive...
oh, man!

700
00:46:33,172 --> 00:46:34,757
Nice day for a drive, huh?

701
00:46:34,924 --> 00:46:36,884
Hey, buddy! Get the...Out of my way!

702
00:46:40,262 --> 00:46:41,806
Hey! I'm driving...

703
00:46:48,687 --> 00:46:49,730
look at my new hat!

704
00:46:54,527 --> 00:46:57,238
I'm flying! No! I'm not flying!

705
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:59,615
Get it. Get it.

706
00:47:00,407 --> 00:47:01,408
' Qot it!

707
00:47:04,078 --> 00:47:05,329
Cruz!

708
00:47:14,338 --> 00:47:15,798
Hey, buddy! Move it!

709
00:47:16,757 --> 00:47:18,717
Turn right to go left.
Turn right to go left.

710
00:47:24,014 --> 00:47:26,308
Here I come, boy!
No, no, no!

711
00:47:31,355 --> 00:47:32,106
No.

712
00:47:33,065 --> 00:47:34,358
<i>Buckle up, everybody!</i>

713
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:37,394
<i>It's fritter time!</i>

714
00:47:38,896 --> 00:47:41,649
Fritter! Fritter!

715
00:47:42,066 --> 00:47:44,693
Fritter! Fritter! Fritter!

716
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:46,070
We love you, miss fritter.

717
00:47:46,862 --> 00:47:52,451
Yeah! Your license plate's gonna look
real nice in my collection.

718
00:47:53,118 --> 00:47:54,495
Oh, boy.
Run!

719
00:47:56,288 --> 00:47:56,955
No.

720
00:47:57,373 --> 00:48:00,084
Remember,
obey all appropriate street signs.

721
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:01,085
Cruz!

722
00:48:08,801 --> 00:48:09,635
H ey__

723
00:48:12,179 --> 00:48:15,265
<i>oh, my gracious! Miss fritter's down!</i>

724
00:48:22,564 --> 00:48:26,068
Nobody touches him. He is mine!

725
00:48:28,028 --> 00:48:29,988
You gonna get it now, whipplefilter!

726
00:48:32,074 --> 00:48:35,119
Come on, McQueen. You can do it.
Come on, lightning, keep going.

727
00:48:36,286 --> 00:48:39,790
<i>Miss fritter is looking to get upright,
folks. And she is not pleased.</i>

728
00:48:40,374 --> 00:48:42,668
Get up. Get up!
Fritter! Fritter!

729
00:48:43,252 --> 00:48:46,338
You about to feel the wrath of the...

730
00:48:46,505 --> 00:48:49,133
Lower belleville county
unified school district!

731
00:48:54,513 --> 00:48:56,014
What the... wait...

732
00:48:58,016 --> 00:48:59,560
no, no, no! No! No!

733
00:49:02,438 --> 00:49:06,525
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner!
Frances beltline!</i>

734
00:49:06,608 --> 00:49:10,028
Is that me? That's me! I won! I won!

735
00:49:10,112 --> 00:49:12,072
Cruz! Cruz! No!
Watch out!

736
00:49:31,508 --> 00:49:33,010
Whipplefilter?

737
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:39,808
It's lightning McQueen!

738
00:49:42,895 --> 00:49:44,062
McQueen!

739
00:49:48,066 --> 00:49:49,568
<i>Fans here at thunder hollow
still buzzing over tonight's...</i>

740
00:49:49,735 --> 00:49:51,904
<i>Unexpected appearance
of lightning McQueen.</i>

741
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:53,655
<i>He has always been my favorite!</i>

742
00:49:53,822 --> 00:49:56,950
<i>My garage is covered from head to toe
with 95 posters.</i>

743
00:49:57,117 --> 00:49:59,787
<i>Tell our listeners at home you weren't
really trying to wreck him, were you?</i>

744
00:49:59,953 --> 00:50:02,206
So trophy's kind of nice.
Don't you think?

745
00:50:03,749 --> 00:50:07,085
I mean, I know you got like a billion
of them, so you would know.

746
00:50:09,421 --> 00:50:13,759
I still can't believe I won. It's pretty
shiny. I have never seen one up close.

747
00:50:13,926 --> 00:50:17,471
Looks like they spent a lot of money
on it. I mean, I think it's real metal.

748
00:50:17,638 --> 00:50:20,265
Stop. Just stop, okay, Cruz?
You don't even know.

749
00:50:20,432 --> 00:50:23,519
You don't even have one clue...
hey! I was just trying...

750
00:50:23,685 --> 00:50:26,063
do you know what happens
if I lose this race?

751
00:50:27,439 --> 00:50:31,443
Every mile of this trip was to get me
faster than Jackson storm. Faster!

752
00:50:32,110 --> 00:50:34,738
I started off getting nowhere for a week
on a simulator!

753
00:50:34,984 --> 00:50:37,111
I lose a whole day with you
on fireball beach.

754
00:50:37,278 --> 00:50:40,614
And then I waste tonight
in the crosshairs of miss fritter!

755
00:50:40,948 --> 00:50:43,367
I'm stuck in the same speed I was
a month ago!

756
00:50:43,451 --> 00:50:47,747
I can't get any faster because I'm
too busy taking care of my trainer!

757
00:50:49,123 --> 00:50:53,461
This is my last chance, Cruz.
Last! Final! <i>Finito!</i>

758
00:50:53,627 --> 00:50:57,965
If I lose, I never get to do this again.
If you were a racer...

759
00:50:58,132 --> 00:51:02,303
You'd know what I'm talking about
but you're not! So you don't.

760
00:51:08,309 --> 00:51:11,353
Mack! Pull over!
What? Now?

761
00:51:11,562 --> 00:51:15,274
Now!
Okay! Pulling over!

762
00:51:21,322 --> 00:51:24,158
Ask me if I dreamed of being a trainer,
Mr. McQueen. Go ahead.

763
00:51:25,493 --> 00:51:30,539
Ask me if I got up in the dark
to run laps before school every day.

764
00:51:30,706 --> 00:51:33,876
Ask me if I saved every penny
to buy a ticket to the races

765
00:51:34,001 --> 00:51:35,753
when they came to town.

766
00:51:35,836 --> 00:51:40,007
Ask me if I did that so I could
be a trainer someday. Ask me.

767
00:51:41,175 --> 00:51:42,676
No!

768
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:48,265
I've wanted to become a racer forever!
Because of you!

769
00:51:53,854 --> 00:51:57,274
I used to watch you on TV,
flying through the air.

770
00:51:58,609 --> 00:52:02,071
You seemed so... fearless.

771
00:52:05,407 --> 00:52:09,036
"Dream small, Cruz,"
that's what my family used to say.

772
00:52:09,703 --> 00:52:11,789
"Dream small or not at all."

773
00:52:14,542 --> 00:52:16,210
They were just trying to protect me.

774
00:52:17,545 --> 00:52:22,508
But I was the fastest kid in town
and I was gonna prove them wrong.

775
00:52:24,510 --> 00:52:25,886
What happened?

776
00:52:27,221 --> 00:52:30,850
When I got to my first race,
I figured it out.

777
00:52:32,184 --> 00:52:33,310
What?

778
00:52:35,972 --> 00:52:40,477
That I didn't belong.
The other racers looked nothing like me.

779
00:52:42,270 --> 00:52:47,442
They were bigger and stronger
and so... confident.

780
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:54,032
And when they started their engines,
that was it...

781
00:52:54,199 --> 00:52:56,535
I knew I'd never be a racer.

782
00:53:00,038 --> 00:53:06,086
I just left. It was my one shot
and I didn't take it.

783
00:53:12,843 --> 00:53:16,263
Yeah, so, I'm gonna head back
to the training center.

784
00:53:16,930 --> 00:53:19,099
I think we both know it's for the best.

785
00:53:22,686 --> 00:53:24,396
But can I ask you something?

786
00:53:27,065 --> 00:53:31,069
What was it like for you?
When you showed up to your first race?

787
00:53:32,404 --> 00:53:34,030
How did you know you could do it?

788
00:53:36,073 --> 00:53:39,327
I don't know.
I just never thought I couldn't.

789
00:53:43,331 --> 00:53:45,333
I wish I knew what that felt like.

790
00:53:48,002 --> 00:53:49,670
Good luck, Mr. McQueen.

791
00:53:51,088 --> 00:53:54,050
Cruz. Cruz, wait.

792
00:53:58,012 --> 00:54:01,057
<i>And earn your physics degree
from the comfort of your own home...</i>

793
00:54:01,223 --> 00:54:04,477
<i>you'll get that and a $200 gift,
for $29.95.</i>

794
00:54:04,643 --> 00:54:06,979
<i>Now look here, warden...
No! He's got a Jack!</i>

795
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,272
<i>Autos over 100,000 miles
also reported trouble sleeping.</i>

796
00:54:10,438 --> 00:54:13,900
<i>You could have 12 wornout wrenches
or you could have one atomic wrench.</i>

797
00:54:14,067 --> 00:54:15,652
<i>Throw the old ones out.
This covers...</i>

798
00:54:15,819 --> 00:54:18,989
<i>"champion for the ages" chick Hicks here.
Coming to you live from...</i>

799
00:54:19,072 --> 00:54:21,366
<i>Chick Hicks studios,
where I'm joined once again by...</i>

800
00:54:21,533 --> 00:54:23,493
<i>Nextgen racing expert, Natalie certain.</i>

801
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:28,206
<i>Thanks, chick. Piston cup champion
Jackson storm set a new record...</i>

802
00:54:28,373 --> 00:54:31,001
<i>Today when he pulled off
the fastest lap ever recorded.</i>

803
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:34,921
<i>An unprecedented 213 miles an hour.</i>

804
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:37,632
<i>So what do you think, certain?</i>

805
00:54:37,799 --> 00:54:40,302
Stormy boy gonna start the season
with another win?

806
00:54:40,468 --> 00:54:43,972
Highly likely, chick. Based on his
recent run times and forecasted...

807
00:54:44,139 --> 00:54:46,641
Track temperatures on race day,
storm's chances of winning...

808
00:54:46,808 --> 00:54:49,144
Are 95.2%.
That low, huh?

809
00:54:50,510 --> 00:54:54,597
And in case you missed it, talk of the
track tonight is lightning McQueen...

810
00:54:54,764 --> 00:54:59,310
Finding yet another way to embarrass
himself at a demolition derby.

811
00:55:00,395 --> 00:55:02,856
Almost makes me feel sorry for the guy.
Not really.

812
00:55:03,523 --> 00:55:04,774
Here's what his new sponsor had to say.

813
00:55:05,233 --> 00:55:07,527
Everyone, relax. The 95's gonna race.

814
00:55:07,694 --> 00:55:11,406
Lightning's just taking a somewhat
unconventional approach to this race.

815
00:55:11,573 --> 00:55:12,949
It's one of the things
his fans love about him.

816
00:55:14,235 --> 00:55:17,529
<i>Yeah, right! Talk about humiliating.
If I were old kachow...</i>

817
00:55:17,696 --> 00:55:19,657
<i>I wouldn't even bother to show up
in Florida.</i>

818
00:55:19,823 --> 00:55:22,159
<i>That could be for the best, chick.
Even if he does race...</i>

819
00:55:22,785 --> 00:55:26,956
<i>McQueen's probability of winning is 1.2%.</i>

820
00:55:27,831 --> 00:55:29,959
<i>Numbers never lie.</i>

821
00:55:30,125 --> 00:55:32,753
<i>I'm willing to predict tonight
that lightning McQueen's racing...</i>

822
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:37,800
<i>Career will be over within the week.
It might even be over now.</i>

823
00:55:37,925 --> 00:55:39,843
<i>I mean, I knew his career
was stuck in the mud...</i>

824
00:55:44,056 --> 00:55:46,767
<i>first you find a can from a rusty Van
bumpbump</i>

825
00:55:46,934 --> 00:55:49,603
<i>quicker than a dart, make it into art
bumpbump</i>

826
00:55:49,770 --> 00:55:51,355
<i>that's the way it's done
it's a lot of fun</i>

827
00:55:51,438 --> 00:55:52,356
<i>bumpbump</i>

828
00:55:52,523 --> 00:55:54,858
<i>liftin' my funk
makin' sculpture outta junk</i>

829
00:55:56,944 --> 00:56:00,155
what's that? There we go!
Somebody's interrupting genius!

830
00:56:02,363 --> 00:56:05,032
Well, hey, there, buddy!
Mater!

831
00:56:05,116 --> 00:56:08,577
You know, I was just thinking of you
and here you are lookin' right at me!

832
00:56:08,744 --> 00:56:12,540
<i>You see me okay? Hang on a second
there. Hold on. Let me see here.</i>

833
00:56:13,874 --> 00:56:14,667
<i>That better?</i>

834
00:56:15,584 --> 00:56:20,297
Looking you straight in the eye there,
pal. Hey, sorry about calling so late.

835
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,045
Shoot, not for me it's not.
I'm always burning that midnight oil.

836
00:56:24,211 --> 00:56:26,338
So get me caught up on everything.

837
00:56:26,589 --> 00:56:29,925
Well, actually kind of hoping I might
hear what's going on back home.

838
00:56:30,092 --> 00:56:34,680
Not much. If you don't count sarge
and Fillmore tryin' to run the tire shop.

839
00:56:34,847 --> 00:56:38,184
But tell Luigi not to worry,
sarge is gonna track down...

840
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:40,770
Every last tire
that Fillmore done gived away.

841
00:56:41,562 --> 00:56:43,522
<i>Other than that, everything's good.</i>

842
00:56:43,689 --> 00:56:45,274
How's Sally?
She's fine.

843
00:56:45,858 --> 00:56:48,110
<i>Keeping busy at the cone.
She misses you.</i>

844
00:56:48,277 --> 00:56:50,988
<i>Well, shoot!
We all do when you're on the road.</i>

845
00:56:52,239 --> 00:56:56,494
Yeah. You know,
I've been kind of thinking about that.

846
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:59,955
You know, what we should do
when I'm not on the road anymore.

847
00:57:00,623 --> 00:57:02,041
<i>What do you mean not on the road?</i>

848
00:57:02,958 --> 00:57:07,838
Well, you know.
Mater, I can't do this forever.

849
00:57:10,966 --> 00:57:13,803
I'm just not getting anywhere
with the training.

850
00:57:13,969 --> 00:57:16,180
If anything,
I've gotten slower not faster.

851
00:57:16,847 --> 00:57:20,059
<i>Shoot, buddy, it'll work out.
Just tell me what the problem is...</i>

852
00:57:20,226 --> 00:57:22,436
<i>And I'll stay right here with you
until we fix it.</i>

853
00:57:23,062 --> 00:57:27,983
That's just it, mater. I don't know.
And I feel like I'm all out of ideas.

854
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:33,114
<i>All right, let me think.
You know what I'd do?</i>

855
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:36,826
What?
I <i>don't</i> know.

856
00:57:36,992 --> 00:57:40,412
<i>I got nothin'. I guess I ain't doc
when it comes to that.</i>

857
00:57:41,831 --> 00:57:44,750
I would give anything
to talk to him right now.

858
00:57:44,917 --> 00:57:47,545
<i>Yep, there was nobody smarter
than old doc.</i>

859
00:57:47,711 --> 00:57:49,421
<i>Well, except for maybe
whoever taught him.</i>

860
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:51,882
Yeah. Wait. What?

861
00:57:52,466 --> 00:57:55,636
<i>Everybody was taught by somebody,
right? Take my cousin Doyle.</i>

862
00:57:56,137 --> 00:57:58,347
<i>He taught me how to sing and whistle
at the same time.</i>

863
00:57:58,514 --> 00:57:59,932
<i>He was very musical that way.</i>

864
00:58:00,099 --> 00:58:03,102
Smokey. Mater, you're brilliant.

865
00:58:03,352 --> 00:58:06,647
<i>Well...
It's all about the shape of your teeth.</i>

866
00:58:06,814 --> 00:58:08,149
I got to go to thomasville.

867
00:58:08,315 --> 00:58:12,111
Oh, well, good. You know me, buddy,
I'm always happy to help.

868
00:58:12,278 --> 00:58:16,031
Think I am better at that than most folks.
You know, talkin' and stuff.

869
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:32,798
Hey, Cruz.

870
00:58:33,465 --> 00:58:35,217
You won't talk me out of this,
Mr. McQueen.

871
00:58:35,384 --> 00:58:37,845
I'm going back. I resign as your trainer.

872
00:58:38,512 --> 00:58:42,391
All right. I accept your resignation. Bye.

873
00:58:43,976 --> 00:58:44,977
Okay.

874
00:58:45,811 --> 00:58:49,565
But since you cleared your calendar,
why don't you come with us?

875
00:58:49,732 --> 00:58:51,775
I'm looking for someone named smokey.

876
00:58:51,942 --> 00:58:55,279
Hoping he can help me.
Maybe he can help you too.

877
00:58:55,946 --> 00:58:56,780
Nah.

878
00:58:56,947 --> 00:59:00,117
Come on. I fixed it.

879
00:59:01,285 --> 00:59:03,662
No. Thanks anyway. But I'm done.

880
00:59:04,121 --> 00:59:08,375
Okay. But maybe this will change
your mind. Hit it.

881
00:59:10,002 --> 00:59:12,630
First I'm going to loosen up
these ancient joints...

882
00:59:12,796 --> 00:59:15,883
no, please don't.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

883
00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:21,347
I'm sorry that I yelled. It wasn't
your fault that I almost got killed.

884
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:24,683
But now you're leaving
and you won't get on the ramp.

885
00:59:24,850 --> 00:59:26,393
All right, I'll go.
You won't get on the ramp.

886
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:27,144
All right, I'll go! Just stop!

887
00:59:32,775 --> 00:59:34,526
How do you know smokey's going to be here?

888
00:59:34,693 --> 00:59:36,028
I don't.

889
00:59:37,613 --> 00:59:39,281
Do you know if he's even alive?

890
00:59:39,949 --> 00:59:40,950
Nope.

891
00:59:41,617 --> 00:59:42,660
Okay.

892
00:59:43,994 --> 00:59:46,747
So tell me this: How do you know
if it's smokey? Is there such...

893
00:59:46,914 --> 00:59:50,584
wait. Mack, pull over!
Back it up! Back it up.

894
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:09,520
Good to see you, doc.

895
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:12,773
Hey, isn't that your old crew chief?

896
01:00:13,607 --> 01:00:18,737
Hey, Cruz? You want to check out the
home track of the greatest racer ever?

897
01:00:21,323 --> 01:00:26,286
Aren't we supposed to be looking
for smokey? That's right, he's dead.

898
01:00:26,453 --> 01:00:28,247
We don't know that.

899
01:00:36,379 --> 01:00:38,340
Are you sure you have time for this?

900
01:00:39,216 --> 01:00:41,885
For this, I do.

901
01:01:02,405 --> 01:01:04,157
If this track could talk.

902
01:01:07,786 --> 01:01:11,164
Cruz, what do you say? Let's take a lap.

903
01:01:13,041 --> 01:01:14,376
Yeah!

904
01:01:37,357 --> 01:01:38,858
Yes! You nailed it!

905
01:01:39,109 --> 01:01:41,778
Way easier without the school bus of death
trying to kill us!

906
01:01:42,028 --> 01:01:43,238
Yeah, no kidding!

907
01:02:00,085 --> 01:02:02,504
Was starting to think
I might never meet you.

908
01:02:03,422 --> 01:02:04,381
Smokey?

909
01:02:08,427 --> 01:02:10,221
He is alive.

910
01:02:10,888 --> 01:02:15,184
I know why you're here. You're thirsty.

911
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:23,484
I'll tell you what, these folks are gonna
get a kick out of meeting hud's boy.

912
01:02:23,651 --> 01:02:28,239
Who's hud? Doc Hudson! Right.

913
01:02:30,241 --> 01:02:34,954
Hey! Act civilized. We got company.

914
01:02:35,204 --> 01:02:38,040
Hey, les.
How's that back axle treating you?

915
01:02:38,207 --> 01:02:39,708
Hey, sugar, welcome to thomasville.

916
01:02:41,794 --> 01:02:44,171
Would you look at that?
What?

917
01:02:44,338 --> 01:02:46,590
Three of the biggest racing legends ever!

918
01:02:47,007 --> 01:02:49,969
Junior "midnight" moon.
River Scott. Louise...

919
01:02:50,052 --> 01:02:52,471
Louise "barnstormer" Nash?
She had 38 wins!

920
01:02:52,972 --> 01:02:56,141
Well, as I live and breathe.
If it ain't lightning McQueen.

921
01:02:56,350 --> 01:02:58,352
Ms. Nash, it's a pleasure to meet you...

922
01:02:58,602 --> 01:02:59,645
you've had a tough year, haven't you?

923
01:03:01,021 --> 01:03:03,816
Shouldn't you be running practice laps
in Florida by now?

924
01:03:04,233 --> 01:03:06,568
Yeah, sure, but...
they're here to steal our secrets.

925
01:03:06,735 --> 01:03:08,362
Looking for your lost mojo?

926
01:03:09,738 --> 01:03:11,323
You don't mince words around here, do you?

927
01:03:12,783 --> 01:03:14,576
Truth is always quicker, kid.

928
01:03:19,707 --> 01:03:25,087
<i>But all he kept talking about was
glory days</i>

929
01:03:26,130 --> 01:03:29,466
<i>they'll pass you by
glory days</i>

930
01:03:29,633 --> 01:03:33,304
<i>in the wink of a young girl's eye
glory days</i>

931
01:03:33,470 --> 01:03:36,223
<i>glory days</i>

932
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:37,850
guido, she's an angel.

933
01:03:39,184 --> 01:03:44,231
Lou won't admit this,
but she used to have serious eyes for hud.

934
01:03:44,982 --> 01:03:45,899
Really?

935
01:03:45,983 --> 01:03:47,776
Even if I did, it wouldn't have mattered.

936
01:03:47,943 --> 01:03:50,779
Hud didn't like fast women.
And that left me out.

937
01:03:51,447 --> 01:03:54,491
Old Lou wasn't just fast,
she was fearless.

938
01:03:54,742 --> 01:03:57,828
The second I saw my first race,
I just knew I had to get in there.

939
01:03:57,995 --> 01:04:02,416
Of course, the fellas in charge didn't
like a lady racer showin' them up.

940
01:04:02,583 --> 01:04:04,126
So they wouldn't let me have a number.

941
01:04:04,376 --> 01:04:05,544
What did you do?

942
01:04:05,836 --> 01:04:07,046
I stole one!

943
01:04:07,296 --> 01:04:08,130
What?

944
01:04:08,714 --> 01:04:11,508
Life's too short to take no for an answer.
Right, river?

945
01:04:11,675 --> 01:04:14,553
If we had waited for an invitation,
we might've never raced.

946
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:17,139
And once we got on the track,
we didn't want to leave.

947
01:04:17,348 --> 01:04:18,932
I think that's how doc felt too.

948
01:04:19,141 --> 01:04:23,103
You should've seen him when
he first came to town. Shiny blue paint.

949
01:04:23,270 --> 01:04:26,565
Notjust the Hudson hornet.
He was already calling himself...

950
01:04:26,732 --> 01:04:29,026
The fabulous Hudson hornet.

951
01:04:30,444 --> 01:04:32,321
Did we ever ride him on that.

952
01:04:32,488 --> 01:04:33,405
Not for long.

953
01:04:33,572 --> 01:04:36,450
Hud was the fastest racer
this side of the Mississippi.

954
01:04:36,742 --> 01:04:38,077
Until he wasn't.

955
01:04:38,744 --> 01:04:39,578
What?

956
01:04:40,746 --> 01:04:43,082
Everything changed
when the rookie showed up.

957
01:04:49,671 --> 01:04:52,674
<i>Took hud all of no time
to work his way through the best racers...</i>

958
01:04:52,758 --> 01:04:54,343
<i>In both carolinas.</i>

959
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:59,098
<i>Past river. Past Lou. Even junior.</i>

960
01:05:01,350 --> 01:05:03,310
<i>But there was still the rookie
to deal with.</i>

961
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:08,190
<i>Tried slamming him into the wall.</i>

962
01:05:10,109 --> 01:05:14,113
<i>But hud never touched any wall,
unless he wanted to.</i>

963
01:05:25,124 --> 01:05:28,168
That rookie never saw anything
like that before.

964
01:05:28,335 --> 01:05:30,546
Doc did that?
Are you kidding?

965
01:05:30,796 --> 01:05:33,882
Couldn't wipe the smile off his face
for a week after that.

966
01:05:35,884 --> 01:05:37,970
I wish I could've seen him like that.

967
01:05:39,138 --> 01:05:42,015
Like what?
So happy.

968
01:05:49,189 --> 01:05:52,151
You didn't come all this way
for a quart of oil, did you?

969
01:05:53,485 --> 01:05:55,362
I need your help, smokey.

970
01:05:56,071 --> 01:05:58,532
Yeah? What kind of help?

971
01:05:59,867 --> 01:06:05,080
That's just it, I'm not sure.
All I know is if I lose in Florida...

972
01:06:06,331 --> 01:06:10,335
It's over for me.
What happened to doc will happen to me.

973
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:13,172
What did happen to him?

974
01:06:14,506 --> 01:06:18,552
You know,
racing was the best part of his life.

975
01:06:18,719 --> 01:06:20,429
And when it ended, he...

976
01:06:21,763 --> 01:06:24,224
well, we both know
he was never the same after that.

977
01:06:26,226 --> 01:06:27,853
Is that what you think?

978
01:06:29,855 --> 01:06:32,524
Come on. I want to show you something.

979
01:06:38,530 --> 01:06:40,449
You got the first part right.

980
01:06:41,116 --> 01:06:45,537
The crash broke hud's body
and the "no more racing" broke his heart.

981
01:06:46,205 --> 01:06:49,625
He cut himself off.
Disappeared to radiator Springs.

982
01:06:49,791 --> 01:06:52,878
Son of a gun didn't talk to me
for 50 years.

983
01:06:53,545 --> 01:06:57,299
But then one day,
the letters started coming in.

984
01:07:09,885 --> 01:07:12,555
And every last one of them
was about you.

985
01:07:15,433 --> 01:07:20,730
Yeah, hud loved racing.
But coaching you?

986
01:07:22,064 --> 01:07:24,567
I had never seen the old grump so happy.

987
01:07:29,238 --> 01:07:31,574
Racing wasn't the best part of hud's life.

988
01:07:33,075 --> 01:07:34,452
You were.

989
01:07:38,706 --> 01:07:40,291
You ready to blow out
a little carbon there, boy?

990
01:07:40,416 --> 01:07:41,250
Yes, I am!

991
01:07:44,587 --> 01:07:47,256
You give it too much throttle,
you're in the tulips.

992
01:07:48,591 --> 01:07:51,302
Hey, lightning.
You might want to take notes on this one.

993
01:08:03,934 --> 01:08:05,936
<i>You got a lot of stuff, kid.</i>

994
01:08:22,035 --> 01:08:26,123
Hud saw something in you
that you don't even see in yourself.

995
01:08:27,874 --> 01:08:29,835
Are you ready to go find it?

996
01:08:30,794 --> 01:08:32,170
Yes, sir.

997
01:08:41,384 --> 01:08:42,969
All right, all right. Bring it back.

998
01:08:45,847 --> 01:08:48,975
Lesson one:
You're old. Accept it.

999
01:08:49,142 --> 01:08:51,644
I told him that.
He's probably losing his hearing.

1000
01:08:51,811 --> 01:08:54,397
He said you're old and losing...
I heard him.

1001
01:08:54,564 --> 01:08:58,401
You'll never be as fast as storm,
but you can be smarter than him.

1002
01:08:58,985 --> 01:09:00,903
Okay, what do I do?

1003
01:09:01,529 --> 01:09:03,364
They said you were in a demolition derby.

1004
01:09:03,531 --> 01:09:05,074
Yeah, it was terrible and I almost...

1005
01:09:05,450 --> 01:09:07,660
are you sure?
Because there's not a scratch on you.

1006
01:09:12,029 --> 01:09:13,656
Funny what a racer can do
when he's not overthinking things.

1007
01:09:15,866 --> 01:09:19,245
<i>Shannon spokes here at Florida
international, where Jackson storm...</i>

1008
01:09:19,412 --> 01:09:22,498
<i>Clocked 214 miles per hour today.</i>

1009
01:09:27,411 --> 01:09:30,497
You want to beat storm,
you need someone to stand in for him.

1010
01:09:30,664 --> 01:09:32,165
Like a sparring partner.

1011
01:09:32,332 --> 01:09:36,169
I'm not so sure.
Not a racer. Just a trainer!

1012
01:09:36,336 --> 01:09:37,254
Go ahead and gun it.

1013
01:09:42,676 --> 01:09:43,719
Yeah!

1014
01:09:43,927 --> 01:09:46,263
With no muffler you even sound like storm.

1015
01:09:47,681 --> 01:09:49,182
You're going down, McQueen!

1016
01:09:49,349 --> 01:09:52,519
Get that arthritisriddled keister onto
the track so I can put you into...

1017
01:09:52,686 --> 01:09:54,521
The old folks' home against your will!

1018
01:09:56,189 --> 01:09:57,065
How was that?

1019
01:09:57,858 --> 01:09:59,401
That'll work.
Worked for me.

1020
01:09:59,609 --> 01:10:01,111
I'm good.
Yep. That'll do.

1021
01:10:01,278 --> 01:10:01,945
Did you hear what she said?

1022
01:10:02,779 --> 01:10:07,242
You didn't show up in Florida for
qualifying so you'll be starting last.

1023
01:10:07,909 --> 01:10:09,661
I'll give you three laps to catch her.

1024
01:10:09,911 --> 01:10:12,456
Go through
the entire field in three laps?

1025
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:14,207
You want to beat storm or not?

1026
01:10:14,458 --> 01:10:17,919
Yes! Of course I do.
Well, then, go!

1027
01:10:19,963 --> 01:10:20,714
Come on, kid.

1028
01:10:31,550 --> 01:10:34,595
All right.
Looks like we got some work to do.

1029
01:10:35,262 --> 01:10:38,599
Look alive.
The reflexes are the first thing to go.

1030
01:10:44,647 --> 01:10:45,898
Why are we in a field?

1031
01:10:46,482 --> 01:10:48,401
Sneak through that window!

1032
01:10:48,484 --> 01:10:50,152
What does that mean?
I don't know.

1033
01:10:50,277 --> 01:10:50,986
Go!

1034
01:11:00,448 --> 01:11:02,742
Not cool, man. Not cool!

1035
01:11:07,413 --> 01:11:08,248
Let's run it back.

1036
01:11:10,917 --> 01:11:12,585
Do you even want to be out here?

1037
01:11:15,463 --> 01:11:18,424
Only two days left, kid.
You got to work harder.

1038
01:11:22,842 --> 01:11:24,135
Wait, wait, who was that?

1039
01:11:24,302 --> 01:11:27,096
I put McQueen in there.
Give you some real competition.

1040
01:11:30,934 --> 01:11:34,437
Hud was a master of letting the other cars
do the work for him.

1041
01:11:34,604 --> 01:11:37,190
He used to say
cling to 'em like you was two June bugs...

1042
01:11:37,649 --> 01:11:38,608
On a summer night.

1043
01:11:38,775 --> 01:11:40,026
He stole that from me.

1044
01:11:40,527 --> 01:11:42,946
Drafting? I've never had to do that.

1045
01:11:43,112 --> 01:11:47,116
Yeah, that's when you were fast.
Now you're slow.

1046
01:11:47,283 --> 01:11:48,785
And old.
And rickety.

1047
01:11:48,952 --> 01:11:50,662
And dilapidated.
Okay! Okay, I get it.

1048
01:11:50,828 --> 01:11:53,122
The new you
has to look for opportunities...

1049
01:11:53,289 --> 01:11:54,958
You never knew were there.

1050
01:11:58,127 --> 01:11:59,295
Sneak through the window!

1051
01:12:01,839 --> 01:12:04,133
Sneak through the window.
What?

1052
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:06,553
When a window opens, take it!

1053
01:12:15,977 --> 01:12:16,728
Yes.

1054
01:12:18,396 --> 01:12:20,398
I made it!
All right!

1055
01:12:21,941 --> 01:12:23,318
Let's go! Let's move!

1056
01:12:24,611 --> 01:12:25,612
Reflexes!

1057
01:12:27,489 --> 01:12:29,157
All right, guido, turn up the heat.

1058
01:12:29,365 --> 01:12:30,325
Okay.

1059
01:12:37,247 --> 01:12:39,750
All right, look who finally showed up.

1060
01:12:43,003 --> 01:12:45,089
This is where we cut our racing teeth.

1061
01:12:45,339 --> 01:12:46,715
In the woods?

1062
01:12:46,882 --> 01:12:51,011
Let's just say
the moon was always shining on us.

1063
01:12:52,096 --> 01:12:55,724
If the moon didn't shine,
we didn't have to... never mind.

1064
01:12:55,891 --> 01:12:57,685
We ran moonshine, dummy!

1065
01:12:59,019 --> 01:13:02,022
By the way, no lights. Instinct only.

1066
01:13:04,525 --> 01:13:05,192
Yeah!

1067
01:13:09,530 --> 01:13:10,698
Yeah!

1068
01:13:22,876 --> 01:13:24,044
Yeah!

1069
01:13:37,469 --> 01:13:38,136
All right!

1070
01:13:50,566 --> 01:13:53,402
McQueen's still not here? Didn't he
pull this when he was a rookie?

1071
01:13:53,569 --> 01:13:55,445
At least that's what
my grandfather told me.

1072
01:13:55,946 --> 01:13:58,073
All right, we got time for one last race.

1073
01:13:59,074 --> 01:14:01,743
Hurry this along, boss,
we got to get you to Florida.

1074
01:14:01,910 --> 01:14:03,036
Go!

1075
01:14:07,291 --> 01:14:10,919
Maybe it's best that he doesn't show up,
after how last season ended.

1076
01:14:15,257 --> 01:14:16,508
Let me put it this way.

1077
01:14:16,675 --> 01:14:19,803
I'm not losing any sleep
wondering where lightning McQueen is.

1078
01:14:25,258 --> 01:14:26,593
Come on, boy. Come on!

1079
01:14:34,684 --> 01:14:38,021
All right, McQueen. There you go, boy!
There you go.

1080
01:14:48,865 --> 01:14:53,870
<i>McQueen is fading.
McQueen is fading. Fading fast.</i>

1081
01:15:00,001 --> 01:15:01,127
Yes!

1082
01:15:04,297 --> 01:15:06,633
Did you see that? That was...

1083
01:15:15,016 --> 01:15:16,976
sorry. I didn't mean to...

1084
01:15:20,813 --> 01:15:24,901
hey, boss, it's time to hit the road.

1085
01:15:26,486 --> 01:15:28,154
Yeah.

1086
01:15:31,074 --> 01:15:33,993
I want to thank everyone for the training.

1087
01:15:36,329 --> 01:15:37,997
We better get going to Florida.

1088
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:50,592
<i>Welcome to racing's greatest day!</i>

1089
01:15:50,759 --> 01:15:53,679
<i>We're beachside at
the Florida international speedway...</i>

1090
01:15:53,846 --> 01:15:58,058
<i>To kick off a new season of
piston cup racing. It's the Florida 500.</i>

1091
01:15:58,225 --> 01:16:01,687
<i>Fortythree cars and a quarter million
fans await today's intense contest of...</i>

1092
01:16:01,854 --> 01:16:03,856
<i>Strategy, skill, but most of all, speed.</i>

1093
01:16:04,189 --> 01:16:06,191
<i>This crowd is in
for one great day of racing.</i>

1094
01:16:06,525 --> 01:16:09,361
<i>I'm Bob cutlass, joined as always
by my broadcasting partner.</i> ..

1095
01:16:09,896 --> 01:16:13,232
Darrell cartrip
and stat sensation Natalie certain.

1096
01:16:13,399 --> 01:16:16,027
I've never seen the numbers line up
for storm like they do today, Bob.

1097
01:16:16,194 --> 01:16:20,073
Storm should be 96.8% unstoppable.

1098
01:16:20,239 --> 01:16:21,491
<i>Well, don't overlook lightning McQueen.</i>

1099
01:16:21,699 --> 01:16:24,285
Whipplefilter! Yeahhoo!

1100
01:16:24,535 --> 01:16:27,705
<i>We've heard stories of the unusual way
McQueen trained to get here.</i>

1101
01:16:28,581 --> 01:16:30,792
<i>Now the question is did it work?</i>

1102
01:16:39,256 --> 01:16:44,803
Speed. I am... speed?

1103
01:16:49,975 --> 01:16:53,729
Hey, boss, they're calling the racers
to the track.

1104
01:16:56,982 --> 01:16:59,151
Jeff gorvette,
how does today's talent stack up?

1105
01:16:59,317 --> 01:17:01,737
I think we're in for a treat today.
These racers are...

1106
01:17:01,903 --> 01:17:04,573
hey, McQueen, win one for us old guys.

1107
01:17:04,740 --> 01:17:06,408
Will do, Jeff.

1108
01:17:06,575 --> 01:17:08,452
Hey, there, buddy!
Hey, guys.

1109
01:17:08,910 --> 01:17:11,621
Stickers.
Hey, sal.

1110
01:17:12,581 --> 01:17:15,250
You okay?
Yeah. Absolutely.

1111
01:17:16,501 --> 01:17:20,422
Listen, you're gonna do great today.
And no matter what happens...

1112
01:17:20,589 --> 01:17:23,467
I'm going to move onto the next rookie
and forget I ever knew you.

1113
01:17:25,260 --> 01:17:26,595
I'm glad you're here.

1114
01:17:28,472 --> 01:17:31,475
Nice costume.
Come here, let's get a picture.

1115
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,769
It's so great to meet my numberone fan.

1116
01:17:34,561 --> 01:17:35,562
What a jerk.

1117
01:17:35,729 --> 01:17:38,607
She's not a fan, storm.
Hey there, champ.

1118
01:17:38,774 --> 01:17:41,151
I heard you're selling mudflaps
after today.

1119
01:17:41,318 --> 01:17:44,488
Is that true? Hey, you put me down
for the first case, okay?

1120
01:17:54,581 --> 01:17:59,795
Lightning! Lightning McQueen!

1121
01:18:00,837 --> 01:18:03,840
<i>Hey, lightning!
Hey, Mr. Sterling.</i>

1122
01:18:04,508 --> 01:18:06,051
<i>To the future, eh, champ?</i>

1123
01:18:06,635 --> 01:18:08,637
Yeah. To the future.

1124
01:18:09,638 --> 01:18:12,891
<i>Hey, just focus on
what you're here to do, kid.</i>

1125
01:18:13,517 --> 01:18:14,684
Thanks, smokey.

1126
01:18:14,851 --> 01:18:17,020
<i>Now, go make hud proud.</i>

1127
01:18:17,187 --> 01:18:18,396
You got it.

1128
01:18:18,814 --> 01:18:20,482
<i>Boogity, boogity, boogity,
let's go racing!</i>

1129
01:18:29,648 --> 01:18:32,985
<i>McQueen is making steady progress
in the early parts of this race.</i>

1130
01:18:33,527 --> 01:18:35,487
<i>Well, it won't be enough
to catch storm.</i>

1131
01:18:35,654 --> 01:18:36,655
<i>Considering he started dead last...</i>

1132
01:18:37,156 --> 01:18:38,991
<i>I don't think
he's doing halfbad out there.</i>

1133
01:18:47,822 --> 01:18:51,826
Not too shabby! You keep this up,
you'll finish in the top 10!

1134
01:18:51,993 --> 01:18:55,247
Top 10's not gonna cut it, smokey.
I got to go all the way.

1135
01:18:55,497 --> 01:18:57,999
So dig in! Remember your training.

1136
01:18:58,166 --> 01:19:00,043
Find storm and chase him down!

1137
01:19:00,210 --> 01:19:01,962
Tell him he has three laps to catch me!

1138
01:19:02,170 --> 01:19:04,506
Cruz says you've got
three laps to catch her.

1139
01:19:04,673 --> 01:19:06,383
Yeah, okay! Tell her, thanks.

1140
01:19:13,007 --> 01:19:16,469
Cruz, what are you doing here?
Mr. Sterling, I was just...

1141
01:19:16,636 --> 01:19:18,179
I'd like you to head back
to the training center right away.

1142
01:19:18,721 --> 01:19:19,722
But why?

1143
01:19:19,889 --> 01:19:22,183
I need you to get Kurt up to speed
for the race next weekend.

1144
01:19:22,350 --> 01:19:26,187
Wait, not Kurt. He's the bug guy, right?
The other one... Ronald. Yes!

1145
01:19:26,471 --> 01:19:27,931
But I want to stay and watch.

1146
01:19:28,014 --> 01:19:29,724
That's not gonna happen, Cruz.

1147
01:19:29,933 --> 01:19:31,017
<i>Now go.</i>

1148
01:19:31,184 --> 01:19:33,144
But Mr. McQueen still has a chance...

1149
01:19:33,311 --> 01:19:34,646
just go do your job!

1150
01:19:35,313 --> 01:19:36,189
Yes, sir.

1151
01:19:36,856 --> 01:19:39,984
And take off that spoiler and those
racing tires. You look ridiculous!

1152
01:19:40,151 --> 01:19:43,780
You are a trainer, remember?
Not a racer!

1153
01:19:45,532 --> 01:19:49,202
If you were a racer, you'd know what
I'm talking about but you're not!

1154
01:19:49,369 --> 01:19:50,537
So you don't!

1155
01:19:54,666 --> 01:19:56,960
<i>No. She's not a racer. She's a trainer.</i>

1156
01:20:05,586 --> 01:20:11,342
<i>I've wanted to become a racer forever!
Because of you!</i>

1157
01:20:13,052 --> 01:20:16,639
It was my one shot and I didn't take it.

1158
01:20:16,806 --> 01:20:20,560
<i>It was my one shot and I didn't take it.</i>

1159
01:20:24,314 --> 01:20:26,983
<i>Wreck in two. Wreck in turn two.
Go low. Go low.</i>

1160
01:20:41,164 --> 01:20:42,373
Kid, you okay?

1161
01:20:42,582 --> 01:20:44,042
Smokey, I need Cruz!

1162
01:20:44,208 --> 01:20:48,087
Never mind <i>that now.</i>
No! I need her back here. Now!

1163
01:20:48,583 --> 01:20:50,168
<i>The yellow flag still out, folks.</i>

1164
01:20:50,335 --> 01:20:52,420
<i>Wrecked cars everywhere.
We're still trying to figure...</i>

1165
01:20:52,587 --> 01:20:54,756
<i>Hamilton here.
Call from Chester whipplefilter.</i>

1166
01:20:54,923 --> 01:20:57,342
Chester... Mr. McQueen?

1167
01:20:57,675 --> 01:21:00,678
The green light's on, pit road is open,
and everybody's coming in.

1168
01:21:01,763 --> 01:21:05,058
Get ready, guys. Luigi, guido, tires!
Fillmore, fuel!

1169
01:21:05,224 --> 01:21:07,018
Okay, I'm here. What's going on?

1170
01:21:08,102 --> 01:21:10,188
No! Not me! Her.

1171
01:21:11,356 --> 01:21:12,023
What?

1172
01:21:12,190 --> 01:21:13,942
What is she doing back here?
Come on, guys! Get her set up!

1173
01:21:14,108 --> 01:21:16,444
Okay! Hot tires!
Wait! What's happening?

1174
01:21:16,694 --> 01:21:18,237
<i>Hey, Ramona you got your pants'?</i>

1175
01:21:18,446 --> 01:21:21,783
You know I do!
Guys! What are you doing?

1176
01:21:22,241 --> 01:21:24,786
Man, I don't understand it!
McQueen's just sitting there.

1177
01:21:24,869 --> 01:21:25,995
Something's got to be wrong.

1178
01:21:26,245 --> 01:21:27,080
Mr. McQueen?

1179
01:21:27,288 --> 01:21:29,123
Today's the day, Cruz.
You're getting your shot.

1180
01:21:29,248 --> 01:21:29,916
What?

1181
01:21:30,124 --> 01:21:32,543
I started this race
and you're gonna finish it.

1182
01:21:33,044 --> 01:21:36,839
What? She'll damage the brand!
She's just a trainer!

1183
01:21:37,048 --> 01:21:39,968
No, she's a racer.
Just took me awhile to see it.

1184
01:21:40,385 --> 01:21:41,302
That can't be legal!

1185
01:21:41,970 --> 01:21:43,638
The rules only say
the number has to be out there.

1186
01:21:43,805 --> 01:21:45,264
Doesn't say who has to wear it.

1187
01:21:45,890 --> 01:21:49,560
No! You can't do that...
did I tell you I love your mudflaps?

1188
01:21:49,769 --> 01:21:50,895
Out of my way, bumpkin!

1189
01:21:51,187 --> 01:21:55,024
Got my fishing flaps, got my church
flaps, my going out and eating flaps.

1190
01:21:57,235 --> 01:21:59,779
Come on, guys!
We got to get her out there! Let's go!

1191
01:21:59,946 --> 01:22:01,155
Tires, check!
Fuel, check!

1192
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:01,948
Ramone?

1193
01:22:02,198 --> 01:22:04,784
Best I could do in the time frame, boss.

1194
01:22:05,284 --> 01:22:08,204
Yeah. That'll work.

1195
01:22:08,496 --> 01:22:09,872
Why are you doing this?

1196
01:22:10,039 --> 01:22:12,709
You said it yourself,
this might be your last chance.

1197
01:22:12,875 --> 01:22:17,171
Which makes it my last chance
to give you your first chance, Cruz.

1198
01:22:18,172 --> 01:22:19,924
And this time I want you to take it.

1199
01:22:22,051 --> 01:22:24,095
She's got to beat that pace car out.

1200
01:22:25,805 --> 01:22:27,849
No! You can't do that!
Now or never.

1201
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:30,101
What do you say?

1202
01:22:32,937 --> 01:22:34,981
Hey! 35mileperhour pit speed!

1203
01:22:35,523 --> 01:22:36,232
I knew that!

1204
01:22:44,073 --> 01:22:47,827
McQueen's team has entered
a different car sporting the 95.

1205
01:22:47,994 --> 01:22:49,203
I don't believe what I'm seeing!

1206
01:22:49,370 --> 01:22:50,663
You're watching this, right?

1207
01:22:50,913 --> 01:22:54,751
What, the girl in the costume?
You're kidding me. He put her in the race?

1208
01:23:05,168 --> 01:23:07,628
The green flag is out
and we're back to racing.

1209
01:23:11,883 --> 01:23:13,593
Cruz? What are you doing?

1210
01:23:13,843 --> 01:23:15,887
<i>Come on. Pick it up!
You got to go faster.</i>

1211
01:23:16,179 --> 01:23:20,767
Call her Frances beltline and tell her
the school bus of death is after her.

1212
01:23:21,017 --> 01:23:22,769
What? No.
Trust me.

1213
01:23:24,937 --> 01:23:28,232
Frances beltline,
the school bus of death is after you.

1214
01:23:29,525 --> 01:23:32,361
What? Right.

1215
01:23:33,237 --> 01:23:34,989
Okay, that was different.

1216
01:23:36,657 --> 01:23:39,869
Cruz, you're looking too tight now.
Come on. Loosen up.

1217
01:23:40,119 --> 01:23:42,413
Tell her she's a fluffy cloud.
What? No.

1218
01:23:42,620 --> 01:23:43,454
Smokey, tell her.

1219
01:23:44,789 --> 01:23:49,002
Cruz, you are a fluffy cloud.

1220
01:23:50,169 --> 01:23:54,549
Right. Too tight.
I'm a fluffy cloud. I'm a fluffy cloud.

1221
01:23:58,594 --> 01:24:01,639
Anticipate your turns.
Cruz! Get your head in the race.

1222
01:24:02,265 --> 01:24:06,811
Tell her she's on a beach and all the
little crabbies have gone nightnight.

1223
01:24:08,354 --> 01:24:10,690
No! I ain't saying that. You tell her.

1224
01:24:12,692 --> 01:24:15,528
<i>All right, Cruz. The beach.
I need you to think of the beach.</i>

1225
01:24:15,695 --> 01:24:18,156
<i>Mr. McQueen?
Yeah. It's me. Remember the beach.</i>

1226
01:24:18,823 --> 01:24:21,034
Pick a line, stick to it. Got it.

1227
01:24:24,370 --> 01:24:25,413
All right. Not too bad.

1228
01:24:25,872 --> 01:24:27,498
This is nothing like the simulator.

1229
01:24:28,082 --> 01:24:31,294
You got every tool you need.
Now remember thomasville.

1230
01:24:31,461 --> 01:24:33,504
Thomasville?
Yeah. Sneak through the window.

1231
01:24:33,796 --> 01:24:35,423
Now that I understand.

1232
01:24:35,673 --> 01:24:37,133
Sneak through the window.

1233
01:24:54,942 --> 01:24:59,405
We're just learning that the racer
replacing McQueen is Cruz Ramirez.

1234
01:24:59,572 --> 01:25:01,157
This is her very first race!

1235
01:25:01,324 --> 01:25:04,952
Actually, Darrell, it says here
she does have one win under her belt.

1236
01:25:05,119 --> 01:25:07,246
At a place called thunder hollow?

1237
01:25:07,747 --> 01:25:10,458
Thunder hollow! She said thunder hollow!

1238
01:25:12,460 --> 01:25:14,629
Try moving half a Lane. Half a Lane.

1239
01:25:14,837 --> 01:25:16,547
<i>Got it.
All right, watch that lap car.</i>

1240
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:20,718
<i>He's gonna go high.
Go low! Go low! Nice job.</i>

1241
01:25:20,968 --> 01:25:22,428
You are smoking these guys.

1242
01:25:23,179 --> 01:25:26,182
<i>Now watch the tire marbles along
turn three. Keep your tires clean.</i>

1243
01:25:26,265 --> 01:25:27,934
Okay.
Bump coming up on the inside.

1244
01:25:28,017 --> 01:25:29,394
Careful you don't go airborne.

1245
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:30,728
<i>Now'?
Yes. Now!</i>

1246
01:25:30,895 --> 01:25:34,065
<i>Watch out by the wall, it's a little slick
there. Watch it, watch it, watch it.</i>

1247
01:25:36,109 --> 01:25:39,195
You have hit a wall. You have hit a wall.

1248
01:25:39,362 --> 01:25:41,656
Haha. Just being aggressive.

1249
01:25:44,450 --> 01:25:48,079
<i>Okay, I want you to pit. Watch your rpm.</i>

1250
01:25:48,246 --> 01:25:50,665
Get out of the gas.
On the brake. On the brake.

1251
01:25:50,832 --> 01:25:52,959
Too fast!
We're back here.

1252
01:25:53,126 --> 01:25:53,960
Sorry.

1253
01:25:54,836 --> 01:25:57,422
All right. Pick 'em off one at a time.
Go, go, go!

1254
01:26:00,133 --> 01:26:02,093
<i>That's it. Nice and straight.</i>

1255
01:26:05,138 --> 01:26:07,890
Go, go, go, go! Smokey, you watching?

1256
01:26:12,854 --> 01:26:15,523
Just wanted to let you know
Ramirez is moving up toward you.

1257
01:26:15,773 --> 01:26:17,400
Why should I care?

1258
01:26:17,567 --> 01:26:18,985
<i>Because now she's in the top 10!</i>

1259
01:26:22,113 --> 01:26:24,740
Okay. Now you're coming up on the leaders.

1260
01:26:31,831 --> 01:26:34,709
<i>Ramirez up to fourth.
In fourth?</i>

1261
01:26:38,337 --> 01:26:39,172
Get 'er done!

1262
01:26:42,049 --> 01:26:43,926
<i>Ramirez is in third.</i>

1263
01:26:51,809 --> 01:26:53,436
What are you doing, storm?

1264
01:26:54,437 --> 01:26:58,399
Hey! Costume girl. You know,
at first I thought you were out here...

1265
01:26:58,483 --> 01:26:59,984
Because your GPS was broken.

1266
01:27:00,151 --> 01:27:01,360
Don't listen to him, Cruz!

1267
01:27:01,444 --> 01:27:02,487
You look good!

1268
01:27:02,570 --> 01:27:03,946
It's important to look the part.

1269
01:27:04,113 --> 01:27:07,241
You can't have everyone thinking
that you don't deserve to be here.

1270
01:27:07,408 --> 01:27:08,451
He's trying to get in your head!

1271
01:27:08,951 --> 01:27:10,953
They don't need to know
what you and I already do.

1272
01:27:11,704 --> 01:27:17,043
That you can play dressup all you want,
but you'll never be one of us.

1273
01:27:24,592 --> 01:27:26,219
Cruz, did you see what happened there?

1274
01:27:26,469 --> 01:27:28,888
Yeah. He's in my head.

1275
01:27:29,138 --> 01:27:33,768
No! Listen to me. You got into his head.
Don't you understand?

1276
01:27:33,935 --> 01:27:37,563
He would never have done that
if you didn't scare him.

1277
01:27:37,647 --> 01:27:38,564
What?

1278
01:27:38,731 --> 01:27:41,609
<i>He sees something in you
that you don't even see in yourself.</i>

1279
01:27:42,276 --> 01:27:46,113
You made me believe it,
now you got to believe it too.

1280
01:27:47,532 --> 01:27:49,617
<i>You are a racer.</i>

1281
01:27:50,451 --> 01:27:51,744
Use that.

1282
01:28:02,255 --> 01:28:05,675
And how far back is she now?
Look <i>behind</i> you.

1283
01:28:05,841 --> 01:28:06,509
What?

1284
01:28:06,592 --> 01:28:08,344
Good evening, storm!
Wait, how did you...

1285
01:28:08,511 --> 01:28:10,012
just back here drafting on your butt.

1286
01:28:10,179 --> 01:28:11,430
Nothing to be concerned about.

1287
01:28:11,847 --> 01:28:14,183
<i>Like two June bugs on a summer night.</i>

1288
01:28:18,104 --> 01:28:19,230
Hey, Hamilton.

1289
01:28:19,397 --> 01:28:21,357
<i>Hamilton here.</i>
Call <i>out our speed.</i>

1290
01:28:21,524 --> 01:28:24,610
<i>208 miles per hour, 207 miles...</i>

1291
01:28:24,694 --> 01:28:26,779
would you stop that?
You're taking me off my line!

1292
01:28:26,988 --> 01:28:28,948
Last lap!
Come on, Cruz!

1293
01:28:32,281 --> 01:28:35,534
My GPS is saying
I have slow traffic in my way.

1294
01:28:35,701 --> 01:28:38,537
No, you are not winning this!
You're angry.

1295
01:28:38,787 --> 01:28:40,497
I am not angry!

1296
01:28:40,914 --> 01:28:43,125
You know, you can use that anger
to push through.

1297
01:28:43,375 --> 01:28:44,418
I said I'm not angry!

1298
01:28:45,836 --> 01:28:48,672
I don't think so! No!

1299
01:28:52,801 --> 01:28:53,927
Cruz, get out of there!

1300
01:28:54,178 --> 01:28:56,764
You don't belong on this track!

1301
01:28:58,098 --> 01:29:00,392
Yes, I do!

1302
01:29:12,696 --> 01:29:15,741
<i>I don't believe it.
It's Cruz Ramirez for the win!</i>

1303
01:29:15,908 --> 01:29:17,242
<i>I am speechless!</i>

1304
01:29:19,034 --> 01:29:21,704
Nice finish, Cruz! You done it!

1305
01:29:22,079 --> 01:29:23,956
Cruz Ramirez!

1306
01:29:24,206 --> 01:29:26,292
Yeah, there you go!
Way to go, Cruz!

1307
01:29:26,959 --> 01:29:28,002
Yes!

1308
01:29:34,925 --> 01:29:36,802
Man, heck of a win!

1309
01:29:38,137 --> 01:29:41,098
Yeah. Heck of a win.

1310
01:29:45,218 --> 01:29:48,137
Hey, Cruz! You were flying!
Thanks.

1311
01:29:48,304 --> 01:29:49,973
You really had it rolling today.
That was cool.

1312
01:29:50,139 --> 01:29:50,807
Thank you!

1313
01:29:50,974 --> 01:29:56,271
Hey, Cruz, your blinker's on.
It is? You got me! Very funny!

1314
01:30:04,070 --> 01:30:06,281
Ramirez!

1315
01:30:07,615 --> 01:30:09,242
Way to go, Cruz!

1316
01:30:10,702 --> 01:30:12,829
Go ahead. Give them some smoke.

1317
01:30:13,538 --> 01:30:15,915
Cruz! Cruz! Cruz!

1318
01:30:27,334 --> 01:30:28,711
You'll get used to that.

1319
01:30:28,878 --> 01:30:30,963
Out of my way! Come on! Move it! Move!

1320
01:30:31,589 --> 01:30:34,717
Cruz! I knew you had something.

1321
01:30:34,884 --> 01:30:37,178
And now look at you... a winner.

1322
01:30:37,928 --> 01:30:40,973
I could use you as a racer on our team.
We could make...

1323
01:30:41,473 --> 01:30:44,101
sorry, Mr. Sterling.
I would never race for you.

1324
01:30:44,768 --> 01:30:45,811
I quit.

1325
01:30:46,687 --> 01:30:49,148
Well, then race for me!
Tex!

1326
01:30:49,565 --> 01:30:53,319
Miss Cruz, I would be tickled pink
to have you race for team dinoco.

1327
01:30:53,485 --> 01:30:57,656
As you know, we have a long history
of great racers, except for Cal.

1328
01:30:57,823 --> 01:30:59,950
Guys, I'm still right here.

1329
01:31:00,159 --> 01:31:01,952
Team dinoco, Cruz!

1330
01:31:02,161 --> 01:31:03,454
Hire her. I don't care.

1331
01:31:03,621 --> 01:31:05,331
Lightning, now that you're retired...

1332
01:31:05,497 --> 01:31:08,292
I need you first thing Monday morning
for a photo shoot.

1333
01:31:08,834 --> 01:31:12,338
Yeah, all right, Mr. Sterling.
Hang on now.

1334
01:31:15,340 --> 01:31:17,801
What? Why is my name up there?

1335
01:31:18,093 --> 01:31:20,429
You started the race. That's how it works.

1336
01:31:20,637 --> 01:31:21,930
Wait, wait, now... wait a minute. No!

1337
01:31:22,097 --> 01:31:25,809
Lightning wins, he decides when
he's done racing. That was the deal.

1338
01:31:25,976 --> 01:31:27,269
Hi, I'm his lawyer.

1339
01:31:27,436 --> 01:31:29,021
That was the deal.

1340
01:31:29,188 --> 01:31:30,564
You are not a nice guy.

1341
01:31:30,731 --> 01:31:34,693
Although, I got to say, you do make
a quality mudflap at an affordable price.

1342
01:31:35,319 --> 01:31:38,989
Hey, Sterling.
Why don't you and I take a drive and talk?

1343
01:31:39,156 --> 01:31:40,908
Billionaire to billionaire.

1344
01:31:41,074 --> 01:31:44,286
Cruz, over here. Just one picture.
How does it feel to beat Jackson storm?

1345
01:31:44,453 --> 01:31:45,537
Take us through it, lap by lap.

1346
01:31:46,371 --> 01:31:49,625
It was great! Didn't expect this.

1347
01:31:53,664 --> 01:31:56,291
Kid's got a lot of stuff, eh, doc?

1348
01:31:58,543 --> 01:32:00,671
Well, she had a great teacher.

1349
01:32:02,255 --> 01:32:05,175
And now you get to decide
when you're done racing.

1350
01:32:05,801 --> 01:32:08,428
So what's it gonna be, stinky? Stickers.

1351
01:32:11,056 --> 01:32:16,019
I'm gonna keep racing. But before that,
I got something I want to do.

1352
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:29,324
Welcome all to historic Willy's butte
for today's great exhibition of speed!

1353
01:32:30,909 --> 01:32:33,620
There she is! Cruz!
I love it. I love it. I love it.

1354
01:32:33,787 --> 01:32:34,579
Thanks, guys!

1355
01:32:34,788 --> 01:32:36,540
Nice paint, kiddo.

1356
01:32:36,707 --> 01:32:41,211
Pardon me. Big hat, coming through.
Get 'er done, 51!

1357
01:32:41,378 --> 01:32:43,922
Great number. It was McQueen's idea.

1358
01:32:44,089 --> 01:32:46,008
He felt hud would've
wanted you to have it.

1359
01:32:46,508 --> 01:32:47,926
I love it.

1360
01:32:48,135 --> 01:32:50,220
It's perfect. It's very oldschool.

1361
01:32:50,387 --> 01:32:52,639
Did someone just say oldschool?

1362
01:32:53,682 --> 01:32:55,559
Yeah!

1363
01:32:55,726 --> 01:32:58,687
Yeah! I like that.
It's bright, but I like it.

1364
01:33:00,647 --> 01:33:03,275
Looking fabulous.
Favoloso.

1365
01:33:04,484 --> 01:33:06,445
Trying something new. I like it.

1366
01:33:07,863 --> 01:33:08,905
Subtle.

1367
01:33:09,072 --> 01:33:12,784
Figured if I'm gonna be your crew chief,
I better do it in style.

1368
01:33:12,951 --> 01:33:14,911
What's Mr. Sterling gonna say?

1369
01:33:15,078 --> 01:33:18,415
I'm actually more worried about
what Tex is gonna say, considering he...

1370
01:33:18,582 --> 01:33:21,543
Bought rusteze. Thanks, Tex!

1371
01:33:22,461 --> 01:33:25,964
I made that Sterling fella
a Texassized offer!

1372
01:33:26,465 --> 01:33:28,258
So, you ready to start training?

1373
01:33:28,425 --> 01:33:30,343
I don't know. You ready to lose again?

1374
01:33:30,510 --> 01:33:32,846
Hope you've got your fluffy cloud.

1375
01:33:33,013 --> 01:33:34,264
I hope you got your drip pan.

1376
01:33:34,431 --> 01:33:37,309
Got my drip pan and I've taken my nap.

1377
01:33:37,476 --> 01:33:38,393
Bring it on, old man.

1378
01:33:38,477 --> 01:33:39,936
Luigi.
