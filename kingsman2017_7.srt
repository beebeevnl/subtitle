1
0:0:6.071 --> 0:0:7.473
Mr. Pickle says, "Yeah."

2
0:0:9.108 --> 0:0:10.942
Hey, no, no, sit down, I'm fine.

3
0:0:10.976 --> 0:0:12.879
I'm fine. Have a good day.

4
0:0:13.711 --> 0:0:14.713
Okay.

5
0:0:41.873 --> 0:0:45.076
Ah, Galahad! You're late.

6
0:0:45.110 --> 0:0:46.879
We were wondering if you'd had

7
0:0:46.912 --> 0:0:48.747
a second encounter with Charlie.

8
0:0:48.781 --> 0:0:51.617
I wish. I'm looking forward
to finishing him off.

9
0:0:56.153 --> 0:0:57.489
All right, gents.

10
0:0:58.990 --> 0:1:0.225
Merlin, come in.

11
0:1:0.892 --> 0:1:1.994
Galahad and Lancelot,

12
0:1:2.026 --> 0:1:4.162
please remain
for Merlin's debrief.

13
0:1:4.196 --> 0:1:7.766
Everyone else,
reconvene at 1900 hours.

14
0:1:9.034 --> 0:1:10.236
So...

15
0:1:11.702 --> 0:1:13.838
the man who attacked
Galahad in the taxi

16
0:1:13.872 --> 0:1:15.408
was Charlie Hesketh.

17
0:1:15.440 --> 0:1:17.508
Rejected Kingsman
applicant turned bad.

18
0:1:17.543 --> 0:1:20.044
We last saw him back
at Richmond Valentine's HQ.

19
0:1:20.077 --> 0:1:22.380
EGGSY: I've caught
a fucking spy!

20
0:1:22.413 --> 0:1:24.516
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)

21
0:1:26.485 --> 0:1:28.154
Like everyone else there...

22
0:1:28.187 --> 0:1:30.289
Charlie had a security implant
in his neck.

23
0:1:30.322 --> 0:1:33.258
A weakness we had no choice
but to exploit.

24
0:1:35.294 --> 0:1:39.364
Hey, Merlin.
Still fucking spectacular, eh?

25
0:1:41.766 --> 0:1:44.402
Come on, guys, loosen up.
We saved the world.

26
0:1:45.036 --> 0:1:46.304
MERLIN: Yeah.

27
0:1:46.338 --> 0:1:50.309
Unfortunately, Galahad,
you also saved Charlie.

28
0:1:50.342 --> 0:1:53.312
When you electrocuted him,
you damaged his implant.

29
0:1:53.345 --> 0:1:54.880
Instead of his head exploding...

30
0:1:54.912 --> 0:1:57.382
he only lost an arm
and his vocal chords.

31
0:1:58.315 --> 0:1:59.584
Fucker should be thanking me.

32
0:1:59.618 --> 0:2:1.352
And now he's back for revenge?

33
0:2:1.386 --> 0:2:3.088
We don't think so, sir.

34
0:2:3.121 --> 0:2:4.222
We believe he's being recruited

35
0:2:4.255 --> 0:2:5.657
by an unknown organization.

36
0:2:5.690 --> 0:2:6.891
Lancelot?

37
0:2:6.925 --> 0:2:8.326
Got the police autopsy reports

38
0:2:8.360 --> 0:2:11.196
from Charlie's colleagues
in the SUVs.

39
0:2:11.229 --> 0:2:12.698
They're not just goons for hire.

40
0:2:13.398 --> 0:2:14.933
Fingerprints removed.

41
0:2:14.966 --> 0:2:16.068
Teeth filed smooth.

42
0:2:16.101 --> 0:2:18.638
I did a face recognition.
Nothing.

43
0:2:18.670 --> 0:2:19.638
And that thing?

44
0:2:19.670 --> 0:2:23.308
A cosmetic tattoo
made of 24-carat gold.

45
0:2:23.809 --> 0:2:25.177
They all had them.

46
0:2:25.209 --> 0:2:29.015
Seems like we're looking
at some kind of underworld organization.

47
0:2:32.918 --> 0:2:35.587
Senora Poppy has sent me
for my makeover.

48
0:2:35.621 --> 0:2:36.722
Follow me.

49
0:2:41.259 --> 0:2:42.661
Please take your shirt off.

50
0:2:52.304 --> 0:2:53.639
