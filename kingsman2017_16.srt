1
0:0:18.068 --> 0:0:20.003
Close the door behind you.

2
0:0:28.378 --> 0:0:30.880
MAN: At what point are you
going to start behaving

3
0:0:30.914 --> 0:0:32.782
like a Statesman, Tequila?

4
0:0:32.816 --> 0:0:35.352
You wanna go back
to being a rodeo clown?

5
0:0:35.385 --> 0:0:37.320
No, sir. I apologize, sir.

6
0:0:39.557 --> 0:0:41.392
I'm Champagne.

7
0:0:41.425 --> 0:0:43.894
But anyone who knows
what's good for him...

8
0:0:45.396 --> 0:0:46.930
calls me Champ.

9
0:0:47.731 --> 0:0:49.332
Sorry for your troubles.

10
0:0:50.099 --> 0:0:51.934
As your American cousins...

11
0:0:51.968 --> 0:0:57.175
I'm placing all of Statesman's
considerably larger resources at your disposal.

12
0:0:59.776 --> 0:1:2.445
Can you imagine us
in the clothing business?

13
0:1:2.479 --> 0:1:3.481
(CHUCKLES)

14
0:1:5.916 --> 0:1:8.118
Now, how can I help you?

15
0:1:8.151 --> 0:1:10.054
EGGSY: First of all,
I've got to thank you

16
0:1:10.086 --> 0:1:11.655
for saving Agent Galahad.

17
0:1:11.688 --> 0:1:12.856
Wait.

18
0:1:12.889 --> 0:1:14.757
You said that you were Galahad.

19
0:1:14.791 --> 0:1:17.093
Oh, no, he's talking
about the butterfly guy.

20
0:1:17.128 --> 0:1:18.796
That used to be his handle.
Oh.

21
0:1:18.829 --> 0:1:19.963
EGGSY: Galahad always said,

22
0:1:19.997 --> 0:1:21.198
"You've got to look at
the bigger picture..."

23
0:1:21.231 --> 0:1:23.265
"ask 'why' as well as 'who'."

24
0:1:23.300 --> 0:1:25.302
So if someone wanted
to take out Kingsman...

25
0:1:25.336 --> 0:1:27.504
then they've got to be
planning something major.

26
0:1:27.537 --> 0:1:28.804
So what do you know?

27
0:1:28.838 --> 0:1:30.206
They're a drug cartel, we think.

28
0:1:30.240 --> 0:1:32.610
The name Golden Circle
keeps coming up.

29
0:1:32.642 --> 0:1:35.077
Mmm. We'll look
into them. What else?

30
0:1:35.111 --> 0:1:37.680
One of our former trainees
is working with them.

31
0:1:37.715 --> 0:1:40.316
Charlie Hesketh.
Total prick.

32
0:1:40.349 --> 0:1:42.619
You got any promising
leads on him?

33
0:1:42.653 --> 0:1:43.787
His ex-girlfriend.

34
0:1:43.820 --> 0:1:46.789
I've been tracking her
through social media.

35
0:1:46.822 --> 0:1:50.193
We believe she's still
in contact with him.

36
0:1:50.226 --> 0:1:53.964
And she's going
to Glastonbury Music Festival.

37
0:1:55.198 --> 0:1:57.066
Oh, good.

38
0:1:57.101 --> 0:1:59.436
Agent Tequila,
break out your dancing shoes.

39
0:1:59.470 --> 0:2:0.704
You have a new mission.

40
0:2:0.738 --> 0:2:2.039
Yes, sir.

41
0:2:2.807 --> 0:2:4.008
CHAMP: Hold up.

42
0:2:6.410 --> 0:2:7.377
You feeling okay?

43
0:2:7.410 --> 0:2:10.414
I'm a little tired,
but fine, thanks.

44
0:2:10.447 --> 0:2:11.581
Galahad, you ready?

45
0:2:11.615 --> 0:2:12.716
CHAMP: Your face...

46
0:2:12.749 --> 0:2:14.118
You got...

47
0:2:16.854 --> 0:2:18.889
What the fuck?

48
0:2:18.921 --> 0:2:20.557
CHAMP: Oh, shit.

49
0:2:21.758 --> 0:2:22.958
Head to the sick bay.

50
0:2:22.992 --> 0:2:25.496
Have Ginger check you out.

51
0:2:25.528 --> 0:2:28.431
(WHISTLES)
Hey, give him your glasses.

52
0:2:32.702 --> 0:2:35.072
You're in luck, kid.
Put 'em on.

53
0:2:36.139 --> 0:2:37.973
You get our finest senior agent

54
0:2:38.008 --> 0:2:39.943
to join you instead.

55
0:2:39.976 --> 0:2:42.545
Right now,
he's in our New York office.

56
0:2:42.579 --> 0:2:45.182
Galahad, meet Agent Whiskey.

57
0:2:47.684 --> 0:2:49.119
WHISKEY: Kid...

58
0:2:49.153 --> 0:2:52.723
looks like we're hookin' up
with a chick at a rock concert.

59
0:2:52.756 --> 0:2:54.825
My favorite kind of mission.

60
0:2:54.858 --> 0:2:57.294
I'm sending my jet
to pick you up.
