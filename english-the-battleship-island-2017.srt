00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,050
- So bear it until then.
- Okay.

168
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,970
All of you brought cash?

169
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:55,050
Take it out.

170
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:03,160
This is our lifeline.

171
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,590
If we lose this, we're dead.

172
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:10,670
Okay.

173
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,470
Dad, where are we really going?

174
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,950
You'll see later. Stop asking me, go away.

175
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,780
You asshole.

176
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,050
There's a fight.

177
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:30,590
Is that Choi Chil-sung?

178
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,130
The famous gangster?

179
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:34,510
Stupid Koreans, making sure
everyone knows we like fighting.

180
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:37,160
Can't help but fight each other.

181
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,990
Stop fighting! Calm down!

182
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,750
Sohee.

183
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,990
Go away! Go!

184
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:04,970
Any more trouble, we'll call
it a riot and start shooting.

185
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:08,130
What the fuck is he saying?

186
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:09,280
Hey.

187
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,570
Can anyone here speak Jap?

188
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:15,660
If you freak out again,
they'll start shooting.

189
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:18,380
So shut the fuck up and calm down.

190
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,380
How'd your mouth get so filthy?

191
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,550
Is it as filthy between your legs?

192
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,620
Did you ever see between my legs?

193
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,510
Did you?

194
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:28,340
Do you even know who you're talking to?

195
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,420
Sit down!

196
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:33,300
You look like gangsters
from some Seoul slum.

197
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,550
So if the Japs slap you around.

198
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:38,700
You take it out on Korean girls?

199
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,570
Quiet, sit down.

200
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,800
All right, just let go.

201
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,120
Sit down, guys.

202
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:49,870
I said sit.

203
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:54,550
Not much worth grabbing there anyway.

204
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,920
Are you a man?

205
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,570
I feel bad for your mom...

206
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,200
Wow, she made a fool of him.

207
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,370
Stick out too much and people hate you.

208
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,660
Sometimes you have to keep your head down.

209
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,450
Some people bring on their fate.

210
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,950
<i>Shimonoseki Harbor, Japan</i>

211
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,870
<i>Dear passengers.</i>

212
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:24,570
<i>The ferry from Busan to
Shimonoseki has arrived</i>

213
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:30,490
<i>Japanese passengers, please
await separate instructions.</i>

214
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,220
Sohee, listen to me.

215
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,220
If you lose my hand.

216
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,670
Watch my back and follow me.

217
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,300
- You guys, hold those cases tight.
- Okay.

218
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,950
Stay focused.

219
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,970
Hold this.

220
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:45,320
Sohee! Sohee!

221
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,570
Excuse me.

222
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:51,510
Pardon me.

223
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:56,170
This letter is from Detective Sugiyama

224
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,510
of Seoul Central Police Station.

225
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,990
Where can I find Shimura-san?

226
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:01,970
Shimura-san?

227
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:03,170
Yes.

228
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:07,280
Detective Sugiyama from Seoul.

229
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:09,570
Told me to find Shimura-san.

230
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,880
There are lots of Shimuras here.

231
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,970
This way, please.

232
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:17,010
Hey, take them.

233
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:17,880
Wait...

234
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,280
Detective Sugiyama...

235
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,410
<i>Recommendation Letter</i>

236
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,950
Wait, let go.

237
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,780
He told me to find Shimura.

238
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:52,530
<i>Workers' ferry to Hashima</i>

239
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,870
Sohee, are you okay?

240
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:57,120
Sohee, are you okay? Are...

241
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,160
I don't need that!

242
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,050
Asshole!

243
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,800
Stop it!

244
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,880
Stop!

245
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:15,490
Daddy!

246
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:16,970
Daddy!

247
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,660
Sohee! Sohee!

248
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:24,410
Sohee, it'll be okay!
Stay with those women!

249
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,410
Please stop!

250
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:47,630
No!

251
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,920
Next!

252
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,910
Take your bag and go!

253
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:11,070
Move forward.

254
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,500
Keep going.

255
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,960
Bastard.

256
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,280
It really is nothing, you see.

257
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:38,470
I just have cigarettes.

258
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,410
What's this?

259
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,740
Give it here.

260
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,620
Go, now!

261
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,340
Don't stare. Eyes forward.

262
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,990
Hey, shut up and put
your head on the ground.

263
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,170
Hands on your head

264
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,950
I said hands on your head.

265
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,300
Nothing

266
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,570
I have nothing.

267
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,820
Foreheads on the ground.

268
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,880
What do we do with these?

269
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,570
It's war here, too.

270
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:13,800
Get rid of that Korean habit
of depending on everyone.

271
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,370
Sir! Sir! You're Korean?

272
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,220
Just a moment, please.

273
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,200
There's been some kind of mistake

274
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:22,260
I was supposed to meet someone here.

275
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,450
We haven't been drafted like the others.

276
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,950
This is from Detective Sugiyama
at Seoul Central Police Station.

277
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:31,420
And this is our performing license

278
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,910
I'm Lee Gang-ok of the Lee Gang-ok Band.

279
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,170
We released a record at
Okay Record Company.

280
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,880
We performed at Government
Hall, Myungdong Theater.

281
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,920
Peninsula Hotel, everywhere!

282
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,550
Musicians?

283
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:44,620
1, 2, 3, 4.

284
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:58,320
This kind of shit always
gets mixed up in the crowd.

285
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:03,010
They said it's a factory.
Why take off our clothes?

286
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:04,120
Follow me.

287
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,990
Go on.

288
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:12,700
Are those tattoos?

289
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,740
Here at Hashima Comfort Station.

290
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,970
We've received a special medal for

291
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,700
being free of venereal disease.

292
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:26,760
To protect our perfect record

293
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,280
please keep yourselves clean.

294
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:33,630
Next.

295
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,070
Sir, just a minute.

296
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:44,070
This is a luxury Western
watch called Rolex.

297
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,530
It was a gift from someone
at the Governor-General's office

298
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,300
I'm sure you'll take care of things.

299
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,300
But I came here with my daughter

300
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,550
Lee Sohee. We came off the boat separately.

301
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:57,260
She's just a little girl.

302
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,050
If you could even tell me where she is...

303
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:01,740
Can you play "Cherry
Blossoms of the Same Class"?

304
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,880
Yes.

305
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,870
Damned music men are
settling in comfortably.

306
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:14,280
Son of a bitch.

316
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,260
Welcome.

317
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,220
Yes.

318
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,470
Thank you

319
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,700
I am from Seoul...

320
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,160
Sorry... Sorry.

321
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:29,220
I am the manager of Hashima Mine.

322
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,450
Shimazaki Daisuke.

323
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,670
We welcome you from distant Korea

324
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:36,670
to fulfill your duty here.

325
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:40,910
As loyal subjects of His
Majesty the Emperor,

326
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:46,530
I grant you the honor of taking part
in the Imperial Army's war.

327
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:51,570
Here at Hashima Mine

328
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,080
for 50 years, this place has
led as a supplier of coal

329
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,050
to the industry of the
Great Japanese Empire.

330
00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:00,990
This is a historic site.

331
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,870
The coal we produce here
is not merely coal.

332
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,800
A single lump of coal

333
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,630
is a drop of blood.

334
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:09,780
A weapon.

335

And a piece of history.

336
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,620
Sons of the Emperor,

337
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:16,870
I urge you to fulfill your duties

338
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:19,590
as glorious soldiers of industry,

339
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:23,200
and to not dishonor the
Imperial Japanese Army.

340
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:28,370

00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:37,820
- Sister.
- Filthy whore!

344
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,320
Shame on you.

Don't get pregnant at the comfort station.

346

One woman got pregnant
at the Chinese station.

347
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,010
They cut her stomach and took the baby out.

348
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:52,530
And a few days later she was
receiving soldiers again.

Stop it, you asshole.

401
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,010
Just give him a break on
bath time and meal time.

402
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:11,380

I request to duel that Korean boss of
yours.

I'm that famous Seoul

I came here to beat your
Korean Yakuza boss.

416

I am Choi Chil-sung,

417
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:02,090
I'm here to challenge
that Korean labor boss.

418
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:05,340
We fight samurai style, and if I win

419
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:08,630
me and my boys will watch over the Koreans.

420
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:13,760
We fight samurai style, and if I win

421
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,320
my boys and I will oversee the Koreans.

422
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:22,820
If I lose, I'll treat him as my boss.

423
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:27,320
If I lose, that Korean
boss will be my boss.

424
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,240
You assholes.

425
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:33,260
That was a swear word.

426
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:36,720
Think you're a circus ringleader?
Drag him off!

427
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,030
Wait.

428
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,990
That sounds like fun.

429
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,280
All you need to do is win.

430
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,320
There are new Korean girls
at the comfort station.

431
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,320
How about betting on a pass?

432
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:52,700
Comfort station?

433
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,820
Everyone stop!

434
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:24,200
Koreans fighting each other
is just what they want.

435
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,740
The more we fight.

436
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:29,410
The more we play into their hands.

437
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,700
This bastard isn't Korean
like the rest of us.

438
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:39,370
What are you looking at,
you stupid Koreans.

439
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:41,420
From now on

440
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,950
I'll be leading the Koreans.

441
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,910
If you back me, I'll
keep the Koreans in line.

442
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:47,450
Please support me.

443
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,200
See me at the labor office.

444
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:58,280

Take pride in yourselves.

Now mostly Korean women work here.

465
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:07,410
But this innocence is part of their charm.

466
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:12,490
This mood is too heavy
for a feast of welcome.

467
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,910
Play that record I brought.

468

Yes, sir.

To help you feel comfortable

470
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:21,880
I brought a Korean record which I enjoy.

471
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,570
It's quite lively.

472
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:25,800
We prepared beds for you here.

473
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,260
So relax, listen to some music,

474
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:31,120
and get to bed early tonight.

475
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:41,240

476
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,660
This is me singing.

477
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,950
This song...

478
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,160
I sang this song.

479
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,090
Hey! What are you doing?

480
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:00,660
Give it back.

481
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,740
Tell them I used to sing this song.

482
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,760
Tell them I sang it, please.

483
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,260
Tell them.

484
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:12,030
She sang what's playing right now.

485
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:18,510
I can sing and dance, play
instruments, whatever.

486
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:21,950
I can clean and do laundry.

487
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:26,840
She can perform, play instruments
and is also good at housework.

488
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,090
Ask her what she did before.

489
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:29,780
He asked what you did in Korea.

490
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:34,160
I played music in Seoul. The Yamamura Band.

491
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:38,090
She performed at the Yamamura Band.

492
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:41,450
My father and the rest
of the band are all here.

Hurrah.

495
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,780

496
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:55,420

How is your training with the OSS soldiers?

501
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:56,320
I'm trying my best.

502
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,380
You've got higher marks than the Americans.

503
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:04,090
The Seoul infiltration
operation you've been planning

504
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:08,010
I'm sorry, but we need
you for something else.

505
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:12,130
Some OSS intelligence
was leaked to our side.

506
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:14,720
The U.S. has developed a new bomb.

507
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,670
They say its power is beyond imagination.

508
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:19,630
The blast radius is up to 200km.

509
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:22,720
If they drop that from a B-29
onto the Japanese mainland...

510
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,920
That's all unconfirmed talk for now.

511
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,670
The point is, the Soviets
are about to invade.

512
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:30,780
The U.S. has already taken Okinawa.

513
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,380
If the Soviets join in

514
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,870
Japan won't last long.

515
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:36,220
It's time to focus on winning the war

516
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,620
not the battle.

517
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:42,240
For a speedy liberation,
we must join together.

518
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,010
Yoon Hak-chul.

519
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:48,300
Only he can resolve the conflicts

520
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:52,620
between all the factions fighting
for Korean independence.

521
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:55,130
He handled fundraising at the KPG

522
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:57,300
but two years ago, he was
caught by the Japanese

523
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,280
and disappeared without a trace.

524
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,240
We assumed he was executed without trial,

525
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:06,130
but according to U.S. intel,
he was detained near Nagasaki.

526
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:07,660
At Hashima Coal Mine.

527
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:10,820
Go bring back Mr. Yoon.

528
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:15,660
<i>We will always be together. Our Hashima.</i>

529
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,120
Gather around, everyone.

530
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:27,630
If we screw up again, we'll
be back in the mines.

531
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,620
Do your best! And smile!

532
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:32,340
If you don't smile I'll have Chil-sung

533
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,240
take you back to the mine.

534
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:35,670
Get ready, quick.

535
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:41,780
Hey, why don't you eat that?

536
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:43,620
Raw eggs are gross.

537
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:47,170
Eat when I tell you, kid!
It's great for your throat.

538
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:48,590
Some people can't eat at all!

539
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:49,780
Hurry up.

540
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,500
Hey!

541
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:57,950
Abracadabra... ta-dah!

542
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,120
Look at that grin.

543
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,320
If you want food, you have to pay for it.

544
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:06,670
Newbies who arrived today,
just follow the man in front.

545
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:10,840
Fuckers don't feed us crap.
The fuck is he blabbering about?

546
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,760
Isn't that dynamite?
What'll you do with it?

547
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,570
Stop sputtering and be quiet.

548
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:18,820
The liquid that seeps out is sweet.

549
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,420
Need to eat at least that to survive.

550
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,120
What if your stomach explodes?

551
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,990
Give me a taste.

552
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,910
Help me here.

553
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,950
It's okay.

554
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,320
It's just the coal dust in my lungs.

555
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:50,670
That's why I cough out black sputum.

556
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:52,840
Sir, are you okay?

557
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,370
I'm fine.

558
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:59,160
Hey, there's gas coming out.

559
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:01,510
So what?

560
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:04,420
Block off the gas! And pump out sea water.

561
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,970
At the center of Japan's leadership

562
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:10,670
in the Great East Asian
War is Hashima Coal Mine.

563
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:11,760
Long live the Emperor.

564
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,380
Long live the Japanese Empire.

565
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,380
For Hashima Mine

566
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:17,420
and its executives returning
to the head office.

567
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,500
Cheers.

568
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:19,910
Cheers.

569
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,670
Rock, scissors, paper! Rock! Rock!

570
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:33,300
We're even, try again.

571
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:35,660
Here, it's your turn.

572
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:38,660
Didn't you eat!

573
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,910
Are you alright?

574
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,160
Support his back.

575
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,490
Are you hurt?

576
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:09,370
It's sliding down!

577
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:11,030
Hey kid, out of the way.

578
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:13,160
No!

579
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:24,620
Huh?

580
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,990
What's that noise?

581
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:46,820
Run!

582
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,870
Run out quick! Bring your tools.

583
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:52,220
Don't drop your tools, bring them.

584
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,660
Thank you.

585
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,700
Thank you very much.

586
00:41:58,250 --> 00:41:59,660
Thank you very much.

587
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:03,910
Thank you very much.

588
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:07,280
Thank you.

589
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:16,800
How many times has Mine No. 2 caught fire?

590
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,950
Do I need to step in
every time this happens?

591
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:25,220
What about the passage to Mine No.3?

592
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,240
It hasn't spread there yet.

593
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,920
How much is Mine 2 producing?

594
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,800
It has the lowest production.

595
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,760
We're already 1100 meters
below the seafloor.

596
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,160
So it'll be hard to mine deeper.

597
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,300
Save me.

598
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:44,800
Save the young ones first.

599
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,780
Mr. Yoon! You must go up.

600
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:52,120
Don't let anyone die! Not one!

601
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,840
No.

602
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:59,870
That's the Korean section, right?

603
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,970
Seal them off.

604
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:04,200
Prevent damage spreading to other mines.

605
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:12,490
There are people here! You bastards!

606
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,620
There are people here!

607
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:21,120
Sir, Yoon Hak-chul is in the mine.

608
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:24,590
Out of the way.

609
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:26,470
I told you not to put him in the mine.

610
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:27,590
If he dies,

611
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:30,370
what should we do if the Koreans riot?

612
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:34,160
By whatever means necessary, get him out.

613
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:40,530
Hold on just a bit.

614
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:45,450
Hurry up and dig.

615
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:48,460
Hurry up and dig.

616
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:51,660
Are you going to work all day? Huh?

617
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:53,910
They're waiting for you.

618
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:57,240
Jong-go! There's a problem in Mine 2.

619
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:02,840
Damn, I worked all night!
Why'd they have to wake me up?

620
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:05,990
Isn't that where we plugged
the gas leak before?

621
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:10,870
Hey, just shut your mouth
and follow orders.

622
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,780
Ah, are you back on duty?

623
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:19,820
Fuck.

624
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:22,300
You sure this connects to Mine 3?

625
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:24,130
Shouldn't you know that?

626
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:25,090
What? You prick!

627
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:26,130
Blast through it.

628
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:27,210
What?

629
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:28,510
There's no other way.

630
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:30,720
We point the gas at these supports

631
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,880
and light it.

632
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,660
Newbie! Shut the fuck up!

633
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:36,970
I don't know if there's enough gas
to explode thoroughly.

634
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:38,070
You know...

635
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:42,820
I hid this thing here.

636
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:49,720
We can't drill any deeper.

637
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:50,470
We can't.

638
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:53,670
Gas keeps leaking, what if there's a fire?

639
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:57,410
That's why we called you technicians!

640
00:44:58,130 --> 00:44:59,370
Okay, okay...

641
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:31,800
It's going in!

642
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,410
Keep drilling!

643
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:41,340
Pull.

644
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:42,820
Pull it.

645
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:55,300
<i>The Koreans heard there was an accident</i>

646
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:58,870
<i>but they don't know yet who lived or died.</i>

647
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:03,220
Announce we'll move wounded Koreans
to a main hospital in Nagasaki.

648
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,470
Then send them to the crematorium

649
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:06,590
and burn them with the corpses.

650
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:09,280
There are limits to how
many Koreans we can bring.

651
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:11,300
<i>Given the war struggles.</i>

652
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:15,320
<i>We will not allow the company
to lose any more money</i>

653
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:20,700
I'll be sure to contain the problem.

654
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:22,950
<i>Chiba -san.</i>

655
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:26,320
<i>When do you plan to inspect our mine?</i>

656
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,590
- <i>The thing is...</i>
- I'm sorry.

657
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:33,840
<i>As I'm grateful for your
recommendation of our facility</i>

658
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,700
I mean to send someone to
express my deepest gratitude.

659
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:38,450
I see.

660
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:40,370
You won't be disappointed.

661
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:44,200
Where is Yoon Hak-chul now?

662
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,090
He's coming! He's coming!

663
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:50,410
Here he comes!

664
00:46:54,670 --> 00:46:59,530
If the company doesn't
release a list of casualties

665
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:04,280
and draw up compensation and safety plans,

666
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:07,920
I will refuse all talks
with Manager Shimazaki.

667
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,260
We support you!

668
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:12,990
We support you! We support you!

669
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:19,070
It's about time to leave.

670
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:24,880
Wait a minute! You give me this.

671
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,420
You're in charge of toilets now.

672
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,320
You'll scoop piss and shit.

673
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:32,090
Hey!

674
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:49,870
Fuck.

675
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:01,260
Someone tell this madman not to hit me.

676
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:04,030
Give me my money's worth.

677
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:08,050
I don't need

678
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:10,070
any Korean bitches glaring at me.

679
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:13,160
Come on, don't be like this.

680
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:31,340
You got trained by the American.

681
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:33,260
But without their help.

682
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:36,370
You think you can escort Mr.
Yoon out of here?

683
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:39,120
The plan was to use the network here.

684
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:42,200
And contact Korean agents
at OSS headquarters.

685
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:45,530
Through an agent planted on the
food ship that stops here.

686
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:49,910
We'll go by ship to the U.S.
base in Okinawa.

687
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:52,620
How do we know you're not on their side?

688
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:56,160
You say you're OSS-trained resistance?

689
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,760
I was a student soldier

690
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:01,630
sent to Japanese unit 7991 in China.

691
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:04,300
Then I escaped last July in
Xuzhou, then this February

692
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:07,410
I met KLA General Lee
Beom-seok in Chongqing.

693
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:11,630
Did he send any personal message to me?

694
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:13,800
He says he'll treat you to
your favorite trotter stew

695
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:18,240
and cold dishes at Hwapyung Restaurant.

696
00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:22,910
When do you plan to move?

697
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:35,870
I'll send in another girl.

698
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:37,620
Just sit.

699
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,740
I said sit! I'm not here for romance.

700
00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:46,630
Why not?

701
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,370
Do the marks on my chest make you go limp?

702
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:52,030
Hell...

703
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:58,120
Don't you need a Korean to
complain to, to breathe easier?

704
00:50:02,090 --> 00:50:05,090
Fuck... even worse than the Japs

705
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:07,700
are these damned mosquitos.

706
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:31,490
At first I was dragged to China.

707
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,950
I had no idea.

708
00:50:35,550 --> 00:50:37,070
They said I was going to work.

709
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:38,870
They drove me

710
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:40,570
to a Japanese army base.

711
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:42,990
Hell.

712
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:47,450
The mosquitos bit me like crazy.

713
00:50:48,090 --> 00:50:51,200
Some mosquito bites can kill a person.

714
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:56,130
One bite, and your whole
body swells with fever.

715
00:50:56,210 --> 00:50:59,280
However much you drink, your insides burn.

716
00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:03,070
There was a girl from Heungyang,

717
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:05,630
the Japanese said she was
pretending to be sick.

718
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:09,410
Put her on nails and
rolled her back and forth.

719
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:13,280
She died in front of everyone.

720
00:51:14,590 --> 00:51:16,420
I didn't want to end up like her.

721
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,240
I was too scared to tell them I was sick.

722
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:22,280
Figured I'd rather die
fast, so I drank lye.

723
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:25,130
But I didn't die.

724
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:27,120
It was a Japanese doctor

725
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:29,370
who stopped me from dying.

726
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:32,340
But then a Korean pimp washed me.

727
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:34,530
And threw me right back
at those Japanese guys.

728
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:43,740
It was a fucking Korean town clerk
who sent me to that comfort station.

729
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:47,470
When the unit retreated, I barely escaped.

730
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:50,820
But that Korean pimp
caught and sent me here.

731
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:53,410
So I need a Korean to complain to?

732
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,200
To breathe easier?

733
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:01,490
Biting the hand that feeds you.

734
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:04,990
You need to control your temper.

735
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:13,660
Sooner or later, things will get better.

736
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:46,620
Fuck.

737
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,840
Are you doing a lousy job on purpose?

738
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:53,340
Try finding any guy who
won't get off on this.

739
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,510
Dragging me out of the hospital to do this.

740
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:56,630
Okay, here

741
00:52:56,710 --> 00:53:00,760
I send out so many of these,
why does so little come back?

742
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:02,840
Damned guards cut the rations.

743
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:05,300
You're not hoarding it yourself?

744
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:06,450
Shit...

745
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:10,660
Bro, just one cigarette.

746
00:53:11,170 --> 00:53:12,760
You still didn't pay for last month's.

747
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:14,050
Fuck.

748
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:18,010
The damned Japanese raised their
pension funds or whatever.

749
00:53:18,090 --> 00:53:19,630
We all had them raised.

750
00:53:19,710 --> 00:53:22,820
So control your gambling! If
you're broke, just sleep.

751
00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:25,950
Wait, pay up before you go.

752
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:33,570
Damn it.

753
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,220
Give this to the attendant
for 10 cigarettes.

754
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:37,570
Yes, sir.

755
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:45,660
Manager Shimazaki is calling you.

756
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,160
Sohee!

757
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:03,910
What is it? Oh no...

758
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:05,130
A splinter.

759
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:07,660
Be more careful, kid.

760
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,030
What's that smell?

761
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:38,120
I've been thinking of this for a while.

762
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,240
After today's accident,

763
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:44,220
I thought I should meet you

764
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:45,820
and propose something

765
00:54:46,090 --> 00:54:48,030
before it's too late.

766
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:49,420
I see.

767
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:52,320
About your daughter...

768
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:56,170
In the recent U.S. bombing
of our head office,

769
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:59,380
Chiba-san lost his daughter.

770
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:01,010
Rather than having her stay here

771
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:02,620
where it's so dangerous,

772
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,170
I was thinking

773
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:07,280
to send her to Chiba-san
as an adopted daughter.

774
00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:09,910
Mr. Lee,

775
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:11,990
we're in a war.

776
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,570
In wartime, winners don't always survive.

777
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:19,320
Survivors are true winners.

778
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,050
On the next freight ship out,

779
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:28,030
let's send Sohee.

780
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:29,840
Huh?

781
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:49,720
♪ <i>Meeting in this world of woe</i> ♪

782
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:54,720
♪ <i>What is your wish?</i> ♪

783
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:59,550
♪ <i>Will being rich</i> ♪

784
00:55:59,630 --> 00:56:02,970
♪ <i>Make you happy?</i> ♪

785
00:56:03,050 --> 00:56:04,120
Airplane.

786
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:11,570
The post office key?

787
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:15,720
We'll pay whatever you want.

788
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:18,570
Hell, how would you know what I want?

789
00:56:21,590 --> 00:56:23,070
We'll give you this in advance.

790
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,870
Wow, advance pay?

791
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:29,160
I need to know what this is about.

792
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:31,280
We need to check a package.

793
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:42,780
I don't team up with
people who keep secrets.

794
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:45,120
If you need to check a package,

795
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:48,090
isn't it easier to just bribe
one of the labor officers?

796
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:50,620
- Well...
- We need the telegraph.

797
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:53,740
The telegraph?

798
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:56,950
I'm going on patrol, how about you guys?

799
00:56:57,630 --> 00:56:58,820
Know how to use it?

800
00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:02,490
Just get us the key.

801
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:07,950
A newbie wants to use the telegraph.

802
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:10,970
A Korean who looks like
an independence leader

803
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:12,820
bribes me...

804
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:17,280
What's going on here?

805
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:22,240
Forget it, then.

806
00:57:23,550 --> 00:57:26,660
- I already know, how can I forget?
- Geeze.

807
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:33,530
Should I go ask the
boss to look into this?

808
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:37,920
Park Mu-young.

809
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,910
Mr. Yoon will escape from here.

810
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:48,320
All we need is the key, no trouble.

811
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:49,920
You decide.

812
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:52,660
If you don't cooperate,

813
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,490
we'll kill you.

814
00:57:56,210 --> 00:57:57,450
Hey, Yamamura!

815
00:57:57,750 --> 00:58:01,280
What are you doing? It's almost curfew.

816
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:10,950
Where have you been?

817
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:13,240
I've been looking for you.

818
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:15,670
The drawings are done.

819
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:17,420
Tell Maeda to see me tomorrow.

820
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:18,780
What, already?

821
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:20,820
I want one, too.

822
00:58:21,590 --> 00:58:24,120
But what are you doing here?

823
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:29,300
They're fighting over gambling debts

824
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:32,280
I'm trying to mediate.

825
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:34,120
Damn idiots.

826
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:35,740
Shake hands.

827
00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:41,200
I'll take care of this, you go on.

828
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:43,410
All right, then.

829
00:58:44,090 --> 00:58:45,660
Have a good night.

830
00:58:57,090 --> 00:58:58,410
You don't need to pay

831
00:58:59,590 --> 00:59:00,870
but I have one condition.

832
00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:03,510
When he escapes,

833
00:59:03,590 --> 00:59:05,340
take me and my daughter.

834
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:07,130
What are you talking about!

835
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:10,090
I take it that old man won't be swimming?

836
00:59:10,170 --> 00:59:14,120
Since you want the telegraph,
you must have something lined up.

837
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:16,740
Just kill me,

838
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,010
or have the Japanese kill you,

839
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:22,410
or take my daughter and me.

840
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:25,820
This time, you decide.

841
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:31,170
If our plan is leaked,

842
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:33,160
I'll kill you myself.

843
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:41,160
One, two, three.

844
00:59:42,210 --> 00:59:44,200
One, two, three.

845
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:55,820
Where the hell did he go?

846
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:01,030
Can't he leave me alone?

847
01:00:02,710 --> 01:00:04,300
Hey, go to my spot.

848
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:05,740
Hey painter.

849
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:10,760
Where's the guy who made
me a lock that time?

850
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,300
Is he on the night shift?
Why don't I see him?

851
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:13,380
Bang!

852
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:15,880
They sent him to the tool repair factory...

853
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:16,620
Bang!

854
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:20,220
to work as a technician,
since he's good with tools.

855
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:20,670
Bang!

856
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:22,160
Tool repair factory? Shit.

857
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:27,160
Good afternoon.

858
01:00:29,550 --> 01:00:32,990
I need a favor from the locksmith.

859
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:34,450
Go ahead.

860
01:00:37,710 --> 01:00:40,670
What brings you out here?
You want another lock?

861
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:44,130
No, I've got a really important key.

862
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:46,720
I'm scared of losing it,
so I'd like a copy.

863
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:47,590
Hand it over.

864
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:49,870
Yes but... I need to bring it back.

865
01:00:53,590 --> 01:00:54,990
Something smells fishy.

866
01:00:56,050 --> 01:00:57,700
How come you get all the luck?

867
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,200
Which woman's home?

868
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:06,450
You're quick.

869
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,530
Her husband carries the key around.

870
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:13,780
You know how it is.

871
01:01:16,050 --> 01:01:19,450
Here you go. See you later.

872
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,240
Hello!

873
01:01:57,460 --> 01:02:00,880
We'd still be nice to
Sohee without these gifts.

874
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:04,490
I know, but treat her well.

875
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:17,990
What are you sighing about?

876
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:21,450
Come here.

877
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:26,220
I talked to your supervisor lady.

878
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:27,880
You'll move to her room.

879
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:29,590
So when I call you at night,

880
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:31,370
you can run out quickly.

881
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:35,380
Can't you ask the manager
to let us stay together?

882
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:38,010
Why? Did he do something?

883
01:02:38,090 --> 01:02:40,780
It's just that I'm lonely here...

884
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,470
The other women tell me I'm annoying.

885
01:02:43,550 --> 01:02:46,590
Even when the manager takes care of me.

886
01:02:46,670 --> 01:02:48,070
Damn bitches.

887
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,920
That's why I told you to
behave well with other people

888
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,450
and be careful what impression you give.

889
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,530
What are you crying about?

890
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:02,010
Don't you know all that I'm doing for you?

891
01:03:02,090 --> 01:03:05,620
Think you're the only
one who's got it hard?

892
01:03:06,090 --> 01:03:09,450
Why do you always say
everything's my fault?

893
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:17,070
Never mind. What do I say to you?

894
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:18,460
Anyway...

895
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:20,120
Always be ready.

896
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:23,170
So you can run right out if I call you.

897
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:27,820
Then we can be together, all right?

898
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:30,840
Got a good movie for us?

899
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,910
Yes, a love story!

900
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:48,820
Good evening.

901
01:03:49,050 --> 01:03:50,160
Bro.

902
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:02,620
Want to see a dirty picture?

903
01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:04,050
Uh, good!

904
01:04:04,130 --> 01:04:05,160
Come this way.

905
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:45,260
The outside door, the office,
and the director's room.

906
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:46,620
You remember my terms?

907
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:54,240
I have eyes everywhere, you know.

908
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:56,700
Hey, boss!

909
01:04:59,210 --> 01:04:59,920
What is it now?

910
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,200
Nothing, I want to show you something.

911
01:05:41,590 --> 01:05:43,030
What the hell? It won't open?

912
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:47,200
Gang-ok, that rat!

913
01:05:59,090 --> 01:06:00,420
Hey, assholes!

914
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:02,160
Who is it? Stop right there.

915
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:06,700
<i>Hashima Eagle contacted.</i>

916
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:13,200
<i>Preparations to transport Eagle complete.</i>

917
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:18,700
<i>Number of passengers?</i>

918
01:06:23,210 --> 01:06:27,530
<i>Yoon and Park, two people.</i>

919
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:40,800
<i>Sending food transport
ship in 48 hrs, 5AM.</i>

920
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:45,050
<i>Find Takagura on transport ship.</i>

921
01:06:45,130 --> 01:06:48,820
<i>Wishing safe return, end</i>

922
01:06:54,550 --> 01:06:56,910
<i>Korean Account Records</i>

923
01:06:57,170 --> 01:07:00,490
Seems the war is going badly.

924
01:07:01,710 --> 01:07:06,120
When was the last time Japan
used good paper like this?

925
01:07:06,750 --> 01:07:09,780
What do propaganda pamphlets
have to do with the war?

926
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:13,450
The U.S. still has enough money

927
01:07:13,710 --> 01:07:16,410
to make pamphlets with good paper.

928
01:07:16,750 --> 01:07:19,720
Aren't wars ultimately won

929
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:21,740
by those with the most money?

930
01:07:22,090 --> 01:07:25,700
Give me the relevant documents
for me and the other Koreans.

931
01:07:28,250 --> 01:07:29,280
Ah...

932
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:31,990
More leaflets littering our island.

933
01:07:33,130 --> 01:07:34,870
Those are bombers.

934
01:07:57,960 --> 01:08:01,370
<i>Citizens and employees,</i>

935
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:05,700
<i>turn off lights and stay indoors.</i>

936
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:07,700
<i>I repeat.</i>

937
01:08:08,130 --> 01:08:11,320
<i>Citizens and employees,</i>

938
01:08:11,590 --> 01:08:13,920
<i>turn off lights and stay indoors</i>

939
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,660
<i>I repeat...</i>

940
01:08:20,670 --> 01:08:21,670
It's time.

941
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:24,820
Why so cheap this time?

942
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:33,160
Too many people involved
now, I want to wrap it up.

943
01:08:34,170 --> 01:08:35,200
Where's the attendant?

944
01:08:57,590 --> 01:08:58,590
Let's go.

945
01:09:11,340 --> 01:09:14,450
Damn those bastards!

946
01:09:18,170 --> 01:09:20,990
Sir, it's time for your medicine.

947
01:09:23,630 --> 01:09:24,780
Sir?

948
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,160
Quiet around here.

949
01:09:35,170 --> 01:09:36,320
Sohee!

950
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:40,300
Sohee!

951
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:43,200
What is it?

952
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:46,990
Gang-ok? Come on in.

953
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:50,160
All right. Where's Sohee?

954
01:09:50,710 --> 01:09:51,780
Quick...

955
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:54,070
Let me see Sohee.

956
01:09:54,170 --> 01:09:55,740
I'll come back for you.

957
01:10:02,050 --> 01:10:03,050
Shit.

958
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:07,720
When did you last see Park?

959
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:08,800
What?

960
01:10:10,170 --> 01:10:12,200
Mr. Yoon is missing.

961
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:18,160
I couldn't say goodbye to anyone.

962
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:21,820
What kind of operation is this?

963
01:10:23,550 --> 01:10:27,070
I had to keep everything completely secret.

964
01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:31,820
And I have something to ask you first.

965
01:10:32,670 --> 01:10:34,780
I found Koreans' pay records.

966
01:10:35,050 --> 01:10:36,170
<i>Korean Account Records</i>
in the post office safe.

967
01:10:36,250 --> 01:10:37,250
In the post office safe.

968
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:40,790
The pensions and bond payments
taken from their paychecks

969
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:42,910
don't go to their accounts,

970
01:10:43,710 --> 01:10:46,780
but to someone else's.

971
01:10:47,380 --> 01:10:50,160
Your name is entered on their contracts

972
01:10:50,590 --> 01:10:52,720
and half the money flowing
into your account

973
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:55,570
is forwarded into Manager
Shimazaki's account.

974
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:58,780
Are you aware of this?

975
01:10:59,250 --> 01:11:01,320
Since coming here

976
01:11:01,630 --> 01:11:03,170
I heard that pay is embezzled

977
01:11:03,250 --> 01:11:05,990
by the manager and several others...

978
01:11:07,420 --> 01:11:08,950
But an account in my name?

979
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:13,120
Even dead workers' compensation
is going in there.

980
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:17,620
Without their families being
told of their deaths.

981
01:11:17,750 --> 01:11:21,950
Shimazaki... I never
thought he'd go this far.

982
01:11:22,250 --> 01:11:26,660
Looking through the documents,
I kept seeing your signature.

983
01:11:27,340 --> 01:11:29,620
Who could have made those files?

984
01:11:31,670 --> 01:11:35,120
Didn't it occur to you that
Shimazaki could've made it?

985
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,700
No labor strike or escape
plan has ever succeeded here

986
01:11:44,050 --> 01:11:45,530
I wonder why.

987
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,530
If you set up a leader of the Koreans

988
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:51,950
<i>and then use him,</i>

989
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:54,200
<i>then this kind of control is possible.</i>

990
01:11:56,250 --> 01:12:00,380
Can you explain how a man caught

991
01:12:00,460 --> 01:12:01,800
delivering huge sums for the KLA

992
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:03,740
could have received no
trial from the Japanese

993
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,280
and ended up here?

994
01:12:08,130 --> 01:12:11,570
This is just what Shimazaki wanted.

995
01:12:12,590 --> 01:12:13,590
Should I answer for you?

996
01:12:13,670 --> 01:12:14,780
You fool!

997
01:12:15,250 --> 01:12:17,450
Shimazaki knew someone
like you was coming.

998
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:18,840
You converted.

999
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:21,970
If you weren't on their
side, you'd be in jail.

1000
01:12:22,050 --> 01:12:22,920
Park Mu-young.

1001
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,220
No one will follow you once they find out.

1002
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:26,660
Why do you think

1003
01:12:28,750 --> 01:12:31,490
Shimazaki agreed to negotiate
over their protection?

1004
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:33,460
Why?

1005
01:12:35,170 --> 01:12:36,200
Negotiate?

1006
01:12:37,050 --> 01:12:40,450
So dragging little boys off to
mines and stealing their money

1007
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,660
was a negotiation?

1008
01:12:45,050 --> 01:12:49,410
If you're so convinced of my guilt

1009
01:12:51,130 --> 01:12:52,530
then right here,

1010
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:56,780
shoot me.

1011
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:02,490
You scoundrel! Trying
to run off without us?

1012
01:13:02,590 --> 01:13:03,800
I warned you!

1013
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,090
That if you betray me, I'll report you!

1014
01:13:05,170 --> 01:13:05,880
You stay there!

1015
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:06,960
Gang-ok!

1016
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:09,010
Listen closely to me.

1017
01:13:09,090 --> 01:13:12,300
This is an American spy
with no connection to Korea.

1018
01:13:12,380 --> 01:13:14,450
If you report him

1019
01:13:14,750 --> 01:13:15,720
the two of you can escape.

1020
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:17,220
If Shimazaki finds out, you all die!

1021
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:19,420
What was your real goal in coming here?

1022
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:20,220
Sohee!

1023
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:21,510
When I shout,

1024
01:13:21,590 --> 01:13:24,050
run to Manager Shimazaki
and tell him everything.

1025
01:13:24,130 --> 01:13:25,380
He's on Shimazaki's side.

1026
01:13:25,460 --> 01:13:28,070
God damn fuckers!

1027
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:30,660
Then when does the ship come?

1028
01:13:30,750 --> 01:13:31,870
Daddy.

1029
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:36,170
Sohee, it's okay. Just stay still.

1030
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:38,130
Why do you take the girl!

1031
01:13:38,210 --> 01:13:39,320
Let go of her.

1032
01:13:39,550 --> 01:13:41,130
Drop the gun first.

1033
01:13:41,210 --> 01:13:42,380
Sir, are you okay?

1034
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:45,220
I'm fine, go watch over our men.

1035
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:46,420
Park has betrayed us!

1036
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:47,880
Put down the gun, now.

1037
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:49,510
Our men are on the way.

1038
01:13:49,590 --> 01:13:51,530
Stop being stupid.

1039
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:53,030
Try reading this.

1040
01:13:53,590 --> 01:13:54,880
What kind of plot is this?

1041
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,530
Shut up, you scoundrel!

1042
01:13:57,250 --> 01:13:58,660
Coming to save someone like you...

1043
01:13:59,630 --> 01:14:01,450
Don't you feel sorry for them?

1044
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:03,950
Ito Takamichi Yoon Hak-chul...

1045
01:14:07,250 --> 01:14:11,910
I will report your treason to the
Provisional Government of Korea.

1046
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:26,820
You bastard!

1047
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:35,410
Run, quick!

1048
01:15:17,710 --> 01:15:19,070
This way, quick.

1049
01:15:26,550 --> 01:15:27,660
This way.

1050
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:29,620
Hurry.

1051
01:15:37,210 --> 01:15:38,820
You Koreans, wait there.

1052
01:15:39,630 --> 01:15:41,840
Block the Koreans.

1053
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:43,530
I'm Japanese.

1054
01:15:45,210 --> 01:15:46,700
Only Japanese can...

1055
01:15:47,090 --> 01:15:48,780
Shut the gate! Get in, quick!

1056
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:50,160
Move aside.

1057
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:58,920
Shut the gate.

1058
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,320
Asshole.

1059
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:04,320
What the hell, why are they shooting.

1060
01:16:09,420 --> 01:16:10,620
Open the gate.

1061
01:16:21,050 --> 01:16:24,570
Sook, get up!

1062
01:16:26,170 --> 01:16:27,570
You want to die?

1063
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:28,800
Let me go.

1064
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:30,370
Sook!

1065
01:16:34,630 --> 01:16:35,630
Stop.

1066
01:16:35,710 --> 01:16:36,720
Don't move.

1067
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,800
Don't shoot.

1068
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:40,410
I'm Ito...

1069
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:47,450
Yoon Hak-chul.

1070
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:15,120
Sir.

1071
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:19,050
Sir, are you okay?

1072
01:17:19,130 --> 01:17:19,880
I'm fine.

1073
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:21,050
Are you hurt?

1074
01:17:21,130 --> 01:17:21,920
How are you?

1075
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,340
I'm okay. Let's get away from here.

1076
01:17:24,420 --> 01:17:26,130
About that account book...

1077
01:17:26,210 --> 01:17:29,450
Don't worry about that.
I'll go back and get it.

1078
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:33,320
Did you see what was in it?

1079
01:17:35,170 --> 01:17:39,120
Sir, I believe you to the end.

1080
01:17:51,170 --> 01:17:52,530
Help!

1081
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:54,280
Help!

1082
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:56,030
Help!

1083
01:17:58,750 --> 01:18:00,260
That man, he shot...

1084
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:01,530
Quiet.

1085
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:43,260
Sir, are you all right?

1086
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:46,120
Sir, what will we do?

1087
01:18:46,420 --> 01:18:48,910
How could this happen to us?

1088
01:18:54,670 --> 01:18:59,280
You there! Did Gang-ok die too?

1089
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,090
Someone thought they saw his corpse.

1090
01:19:02,170 --> 01:19:03,870
So we're looking...

1091
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:06,570
Gang-ok, where are you?

1092
01:19:19,050 --> 01:19:20,370
Damn it.

1093
01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:24,030
Daddy, I'm thirsty.

1094
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:36,660
Why are you giving me that?

1095
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:39,740
- Any food here?
- Probably.

1096
01:19:42,750 --> 01:19:46,820
Drive out the Koreans!

1097
01:19:47,170 --> 01:19:50,780
Drive out the Koreans!

1098
01:19:51,210 --> 01:19:54,410
Drive out the Koreans!

1099
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:00,370
Does the line work?

1100
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:05,470
Hold out as long as you can
with the food and water you have.

1101
01:20:05,550 --> 01:20:06,510
Our manager's unrecoverable.

1102
01:20:06,590 --> 01:20:08,550
Are you telling us to just die?

1103
01:20:08,630 --> 01:20:11,820
Yesterday the U.S. dropped
a new bomb on Hiroshima.

1104
01:20:12,130 --> 01:20:13,590
A new bomb?

1105
01:20:13,670 --> 01:20:15,260
Word is coming in

1106
01:20:15,340 --> 01:20:16,670
that it's tremendously powerful.

1107
01:20:16,750 --> 01:20:18,720
<i>There's no official report yet.</i>

1108
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:20,780
But it's said there are 100,000 casualties.

1109
01:20:21,210 --> 01:20:24,700
<i>And no living thing survived.</i>

1110
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:34,530
<i>The Americans have created
something unimaginable.</i>

1111
01:20:40,210 --> 01:20:44,420
Are we going to lose this war?

1112
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:47,260
<i>After Hitler's death and
the fall of Germany.</i>

1113
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:50,050
<i>Industrialists who helped the Nazis.</i>

1114
01:20:50,130 --> 01:20:52,910
<i>Are being lined up and
tried as war criminals.</i>

1115
01:20:53,170 --> 01:20:56,670
<i>If you have any materials
that can be used against us</i>

1116
01:20:56,750 --> 01:20:59,090
burn them.

1117
01:20:59,170 --> 01:21:01,780
If it's a war crimes trial.

1118
01:21:02,250 --> 01:21:05,380
Shouldn't we kill the Koreans
who could testify against us?

1119
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:07,760
That'd be the most effective solution.

1120
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,410
But with Shimazaki in that state

1121
01:21:10,210 --> 01:21:11,490
<i>can it be done?</i>

1122
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:16,530
<i>If you take care of things properly</i>

1123
01:21:17,170 --> 01:21:21,950
<i>then surely you can take his place.</i>

1124
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:27,700
Drive out the Koreans!

1125
01:21:28,170 --> 01:21:31,950
Drive them out!

1126
01:21:32,340 --> 01:21:36,030
Drive out the Koreans!

1127
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:44,660
You little prick.

1128
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:51,820
You ruined everything!

1129
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:04,740
Does it hurt a lot?

1130
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:14,780
I can't believe this.

1131
01:22:17,130 --> 01:22:20,090
Corpses will be burned to prevent disease.

1132
01:22:20,170 --> 01:22:22,820
So finish identifying the bodies.

1133
01:22:24,130 --> 01:22:26,880
What about Japanese corpses?

1134
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:31,450
Why is it only us who are
burned like garbage?

1135
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:34,760
So as not to create more panic

1136
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:39,490
for now, only you and I must
know of the manager's death.

1137
01:22:53,090 --> 01:22:54,530
Take this for now.

1138
01:22:55,550 --> 01:22:57,170
I couldn't find what you described

1139
01:22:57,250 --> 01:22:58,700
so I just took anything.

1140
01:23:07,090 --> 01:23:09,530
I hear a Japanese schoolgirl was murdered

1141
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:12,510
Korean attendant Song
Jong-go says he saw it.

1142
01:23:12,590 --> 01:23:14,570
And the suspect is Korean.

1143
01:23:14,750 --> 01:23:16,200
That's good news.

1144
01:23:18,670 --> 01:23:21,950
Now we have a justification
to crack down on the Koreans.

1145
01:23:27,380 --> 01:23:28,380
Hey!

1146
01:23:36,630 --> 01:23:37,630
Hey!

1147
01:23:38,250 --> 01:23:39,280
Sohee!

1148
01:23:39,710 --> 01:23:41,090
Bro, you're alive?

1149
01:23:41,170 --> 01:23:43,300
You think I'm dead?

1150
01:23:43,380 --> 01:23:44,630
Why'd you want to meet here

1151
01:23:44,710 --> 01:23:46,030
and not the kitchen?

1152
01:23:46,340 --> 01:23:49,200
There's someone who can't know
the two of us are alive.

1153
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:51,320
Have this.

1154
01:23:52,050 --> 01:23:53,570
What the hell? Eat this?

1155
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:55,970
Hey, take a can from my shelf.

1156
01:23:56,050 --> 01:23:58,320
It disappeared in the bombing.

1157
01:23:58,630 --> 01:24:00,820
Huh? What about the cash?

1158
01:24:02,130 --> 01:24:03,130
All of it?

1159
01:24:04,170 --> 01:24:05,170
God damn it.

1160
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:09,220
It was a life-or-death situation.

1161
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:11,780
Why didn't you get it? Where have you been?

1162
01:24:13,710 --> 01:24:15,070
It's a long story.

1163
01:24:16,420 --> 01:24:18,320
Is Yoon asking about me?

1164
01:24:25,630 --> 01:24:27,450
Until the situation stabilizes

1165
01:24:27,670 --> 01:24:30,820
I will carry out the duties
of our wounded manager.

1166
01:24:31,460 --> 01:24:33,200
During this vicious American attack

1167
01:24:33,590 --> 01:24:35,700
when everyone is heartbroken

1168
01:24:36,630 --> 01:24:38,780
an innocent, pretty young girl

1169
01:24:39,210 --> 01:24:43,030
lost her life to a savage who
couldn't control his lust.

1170
01:24:43,340 --> 01:24:46,510
Can you see this innocent victim's family?

1171
01:24:46,590 --> 01:24:48,420
If you've any conscience, come forward!

1172
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:52,740
What evidence do you
have that it was a Korean?

1173
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:55,740
Witness, come forward.

1174
01:24:57,500 --> 01:24:59,490
Identify the suspect.

1175
01:25:10,710 --> 01:25:13,220
He was with us yesterday.

1176
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:14,740
You scumbag!

1177
01:25:24,130 --> 01:25:26,910
Don't overdo it, you thug.

1178
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:36,820
Ah, I want some cold soy noodles.

1179
01:25:37,380 --> 01:25:41,910
With savory broth... salt on top

1180
01:25:42,210 --> 01:25:44,280
I like it better with sugar.

1181
01:25:46,460 --> 01:25:48,780
All right, sugar it is.

1182
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:52,870
Pull out a mouthful of those noodles...

1183
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:58,160
With radish kimchi on the side...

1184
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:04,320
Oh, let's stop this.

1185
01:26:05,210 --> 01:26:06,530
Only makes me hungrier.

1186
01:26:08,090 --> 01:26:09,990
When we get out of here,

1187
01:26:10,420 --> 01:26:12,120
let's go eat noodles first.

1188
01:26:14,380 --> 01:26:17,070
Then, we'll go back home?

1189
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:18,950
Of course.

1190
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:22,620
That's why your dad is helping me.

1191
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:25,320
But right now...

1192
01:26:26,550 --> 01:26:28,950
There's something I need
you to help me with.

1193
01:26:30,170 --> 01:26:31,780
Will you help me?

1194
01:26:33,250 --> 01:26:34,570
Mr. Yoon.

1195
01:26:35,380 --> 01:26:38,660
If you get a chance to leave
this island, you'll take it?

1196
01:26:39,380 --> 01:26:41,970
If I take you to the U.S. occupied zone,

1197
01:26:42,050 --> 01:26:44,840
can you tell them I helped you
to look after the laborers

1198
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:47,970
and supported Korean liberation?

1199
01:26:48,050 --> 01:26:50,010
If the manager is dead,

1200
01:26:50,090 --> 01:26:52,570
you'll probably get his position.

1201
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:55,050
Is that really necessary?

1202
01:26:55,130 --> 01:26:56,950
I've thought it over

1203
01:26:57,630 --> 01:27:00,780
and we're both smart enough to know

1204
01:27:01,250 --> 01:27:03,700
how this war will end.

1205
01:27:04,710 --> 01:27:06,720
In return for getting you out

1206
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:11,070
give me the money you
pocketed with the manager.

1207
01:27:11,550 --> 01:27:14,170
Can I leave right away?

1208
01:27:14,250 --> 01:27:16,820
The coal transport ship is almost repaired,

1209
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,510
our communications are back,

1210
01:27:18,590 --> 01:27:21,030
and it's no problem to leave here with you,

1211
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:24,660
but if I want to take
my family from Nagasaki

1212
01:27:25,460 --> 01:27:27,260
I'll have to follow the
head office's command

1213
01:27:27,750 --> 01:27:31,280
and deal with all the Koreans.

1214
01:27:36,250 --> 01:27:38,070
Deal with?

1215
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,760
The Koreans who remembers
what happened here

1216
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:44,780
must be killed.

1217
01:27:45,050 --> 01:27:48,160
Where did that old man Yoon hide it?

1218
01:27:59,380 --> 01:28:02,030
<i>Records of Korean Laborers</i>

1219
01:28:19,130 --> 01:28:20,200
Hey!

1220
01:28:20,550 --> 01:28:23,420
You lost your position
as the Korean leader

1221
01:28:23,500 --> 01:28:28,220
and took out your grudge
against a Japanese girl

1222
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:30,170
but she fought back

1223
01:28:30,250 --> 01:28:33,380
and you strangled her.

1224
01:28:33,460 --> 01:28:36,620
Is that so hard to admit?

1225
01:28:37,670 --> 01:28:41,590
Hey! Just say it's true and
sign with your thumbprint

1226
01:28:41,670 --> 01:28:44,990
then I'll treat you like my older brother.

1227
01:28:46,300 --> 01:28:47,620
Song Jong-go...

1228
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:51,120
I will fold you like a blanket

1229
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:55,370
and chop you into pieces, you prick.

1230
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:00,090
Gather all the remaining dynamite.

1231
01:29:00,170 --> 01:29:02,950
Tomorrow we'll put all
the Koreans in the mine.

1232
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:06,240
Tomorrow morning...

1233
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:10,410
Yamada plans to force all the Koreans
into the mine and kill us.

1234
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:13,820
Women of course, and even children.

1235
01:29:23,170 --> 01:29:24,280
I beg you.

1236
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,160
I won't ask for myself

1237
01:29:30,420 --> 01:29:33,160
but please take Sohee away from here.

1238
01:29:39,710 --> 01:29:42,410
Surely you can manage to take her.

1239
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:47,120
I'm going to escape

1240
01:29:52,050 --> 01:29:54,120
with all the Koreans here.

1241
01:29:56,250 --> 01:29:58,820
In this place where we sweated and toiled

1242
01:29:59,050 --> 01:30:01,990
we have a right to proper treatment.

1243
01:30:02,590 --> 01:30:06,530
Today's arrest of Choi
Chil-sung as a murder suspect

1244
01:30:07,050 --> 01:30:09,970
is no different from what

1245
01:30:10,050 --> 01:30:13,280
all us Koreans have suffered!

1246
01:30:14,130 --> 01:30:15,420
Therefore, I

1247
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:17,780
requested Manager Shimazaki

1248
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:21,050
to stop Koreans from
being unfairly accused

1249
01:30:21,130 --> 01:30:24,280
and demanded an open trial.

1250
01:30:28,420 --> 01:30:30,570
- Out of the way.
- Let's go.

1251
01:30:31,670 --> 01:30:32,950
And furthermore.

1252
01:30:33,420 --> 01:30:35,380
I will reach an agreement
with the manager.

1253
01:30:35,460 --> 01:30:36,530
First.

1254
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:38,510
We will be given the same quality food

1255
01:30:38,590 --> 01:30:40,590
as the Japanese.

1256
01:30:40,670 --> 01:30:41,670
Second.

1257
01:30:42,460 --> 01:30:44,300
The coal quotas raised last month

1258
01:30:44,380 --> 01:30:45,630
will be lowered.

1259
01:30:45,710 --> 01:30:46,470
Third.

1260
01:30:46,550 --> 01:30:48,910
Full time off on holidays.

1261
01:30:49,420 --> 01:30:50,420
Fourth.

1262
01:30:50,710 --> 01:30:54,450
Work to repair the island
will be compensated.

1263
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:58,760
And finally! Injured young
workers will all be returned

1264
01:30:58,840 --> 01:31:01,120
to our homeland Korea.

1265
01:31:01,420 --> 01:31:03,870
We'll send them home.

1266
01:31:08,090 --> 01:31:09,950
There's just one condition.

1267
01:31:10,590 --> 01:31:12,870
Given what we will receive,

1268
01:31:13,630 --> 01:31:15,450
we need to show our sincerity.

1269
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:17,510
Tomorrow is Hashima Mine's first opening

1270
01:31:17,590 --> 01:31:20,820
since the bombing.

1271
01:31:21,300 --> 01:31:24,700
The manager has asked

1272
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:27,820
as a show of our unity
and for a new start

1273
01:31:28,090 --> 01:31:31,880
that all Koreans including
women and children

1274
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:35,950
join the opening ceremony inside the mine.

1275
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:38,670
What do you all think?

1276
01:31:38,750 --> 01:31:39,990
I object!

1277
01:31:40,380 --> 01:31:41,470
- Huh?
- Who is he?

1278
01:31:41,550 --> 01:31:44,280
Yoon Hak-chul never met the manager today.

1279
01:31:44,590 --> 01:31:45,910
The manager is dead.

1280
01:31:46,340 --> 01:31:48,070
If you enter the mine tomorrow

1281
01:31:48,460 --> 01:31:50,880
acting manager Yamada will have you buried.

1282
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:51,510
What?

1283
01:31:51,590 --> 01:31:54,130
Park Mu-young, stop trying to stir chaos.

1284
01:31:54,210 --> 01:31:56,220
The U.S. has invaded Okinawa

1285
01:31:56,300 --> 01:31:58,120
and the war is almost over.

1286
01:31:58,380 --> 01:32:01,870
Yoon Hak-chul and Yamada
plan to bury you here

1287
01:32:02,050 --> 01:32:04,510
and then escape to the U.S. army.

1288
01:32:04,590 --> 01:32:05,620
Friends!

1289
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:09,300
That man is a spy trying to
divide us Koreans! A spy!

1290
01:32:09,380 --> 01:32:10,570
All of you here

1291
01:32:11,340 --> 01:32:14,920
are decisive witnesses

1292
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,630
of Hashima's war crimes.

1293
01:32:16,710 --> 01:32:17,990
Therefore, this company

1294
01:32:18,590 --> 01:32:22,320
plans to bury you in the
mine to destroy all evidence.

1295
01:32:23,050 --> 01:32:24,050
People!

1296
01:32:24,420 --> 01:32:25,780
Tell me!

1297
01:32:26,380 --> 01:32:27,300
Who do you trust?

1298
01:32:27,380 --> 01:32:29,990
You fucker!

1299
01:32:30,340 --> 01:32:33,320
That old geezer is a real fox.

1300
01:32:33,420 --> 01:32:35,130
Listen up, everyone.

1301
01:32:35,210 --> 01:32:39,320
Park is an independence fighter
who came to rescue Yoon.

1302
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:42,920
But... if you can believe it,

1303
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:46,800
Park discovered that Yoon
was Shimazaki's informant,

1304
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:49,450
so Yoon shot him with a gun!

1305
01:32:50,460 --> 01:32:51,920
And this here!

1306
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,090
Written by Yoon and the manager.

1307
01:32:54,170 --> 01:32:58,370
Lists all of the money they
skimmed off your paychecks.

1308
01:32:59,420 --> 01:33:02,470
People who died of
accidents, hunger, sickness, violence.

1309
01:33:02,550 --> 01:33:06,510
People who died trying to escape.
You stole their compensation.

1310
01:33:06,590 --> 01:33:07,820
This man Lee Gang-ok,

1311
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:09,590
to kiss up to the Japanese

1312
01:33:09,670 --> 01:33:11,530
sold his own daughter.

1313
01:33:13,130 --> 01:33:14,320
And that spy

1314
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:17,840
is completely unknown to us,
coming from who knows where.

1315
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:18,920
That's right.

1316
01:33:19,210 --> 01:33:20,260
How do we know

1317
01:33:20,340 --> 01:33:23,700
Gang-ok and that newbie aren't spies?

1318
01:33:24,670 --> 01:33:26,220
Calm down.

1319
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:28,420
All of us need to band together.

1320
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:31,170
Let's keep our heads and not be fooled.

1321
01:33:31,250 --> 01:33:34,840
These unknown guys coming in
and slandering our Mr. Yoon

1322
01:33:34,920 --> 01:33:36,120
I saw it too.

1323
01:33:37,420 --> 01:33:41,260
Put down the gun, now!
Our men are on the way

1324
01:33:41,340 --> 01:33:42,530
I saw it.

1325
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:46,630
I saw you shoot him and Choong-ho too.

1326
01:33:46,710 --> 01:33:49,450
Jang-woo, have you been bought off too?

1327
01:33:49,590 --> 01:33:52,120
Why betray your own country?

1328
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:54,840
Do you really have to sell me?

1329
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:58,010
Stop it, Jang-woo! How could you do it too?

1330
01:33:58,090 --> 01:34:00,070
What if I show you this?

1331
01:34:03,960 --> 01:34:05,740
4088 Yoon Hak-chul.

1332
01:34:06,090 --> 01:34:08,990
Torn off your shirt by
Choong-ho as he died.

1333
01:34:10,210 --> 01:34:13,490
Don't be fooled by appearances.

1334
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:15,550
They're deceiving you.

1335
01:34:15,630 --> 01:34:18,380
I saw it too! He's a bad man.

1336
01:34:18,460 --> 01:34:21,170
That girl saw such an awful thing?

1337
01:34:21,250 --> 01:34:23,410
First, let's look at those documents.

1338
01:34:25,750 --> 01:34:27,660
This is nuts.

1339
01:34:32,380 --> 01:34:35,550
You need to prove what they say isn't true.

1340
01:34:35,630 --> 01:34:37,340
Ito Takamichi, Yoon Hak-chul.

1341
01:34:37,420 --> 01:34:39,200
That money you worked for

1342
01:34:39,960 --> 01:34:42,010
is dirty Japanese money.

1343
01:34:42,090 --> 01:34:43,260
Guilty of treason.

1344
01:34:43,340 --> 01:34:47,030
That money was for Korean independence.

1345
01:34:47,380 --> 01:34:48,220
Was that so wrong?

1346
01:34:48,300 --> 01:34:50,510
Bleeding the people dry!

1347
01:34:50,590 --> 01:34:51,800
It was for us!

1348
01:34:51,880 --> 01:34:54,260
Pretending to lead and
deceiving the people.

1349
01:34:54,340 --> 01:34:55,590
You fools.

1350
01:34:55,670 --> 01:34:56,630
For betraying the nation...

1351
01:34:56,710 --> 01:34:59,880
You think killing me will bring liberation?

1352
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:01,010
I punish you in the name of Korea!

1353
01:35:01,090 --> 01:35:03,070
I'm the one who gave you
guys all everything.

1354
01:35:23,380 --> 01:35:25,320
So what are we going to do?

1355
01:35:25,710 --> 01:35:28,510
No one's ever managed to escape here.

1356
01:35:28,590 --> 01:35:30,490
Think we can all just
hold hands and leave?

1357
01:35:31,170 --> 01:35:34,550
Yoon has always tipped off the manager,

1358
01:35:34,630 --> 01:35:35,870
that's why they failed.

1359
01:35:36,550 --> 01:35:39,370
If we take the coal transport
ship in the harbor

1360
01:35:39,750 --> 01:35:40,590
we can succeed.

1361
01:35:40,670 --> 01:35:41,670
Wait a minute.

1362
01:35:42,630 --> 01:35:44,300
Who's going to drive that big ship?

1363
01:35:44,380 --> 01:35:47,740
Hold on, we got a few boatmen here.

1364
01:35:49,880 --> 01:35:51,780
I've sailed fishing boats.

1365
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:54,920
I know the route, so with
5 or 6 men to row...

1366
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,160
Hold on.

1367
01:35:56,340 --> 01:35:58,630
That freight ship is not a fishing boat.

1368
01:35:58,710 --> 01:36:01,470
It's not just that, if we all run for it.

1369
01:36:01,550 --> 01:36:05,200
Won't they start shooting
and stabbing us? What then?

1370
01:36:06,050 --> 01:36:07,840
The guards who come to Hashima

1371
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:10,450
were all judged unfit for the battlefield.

1372
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:12,370
And after the bombing

1373
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,030
they're still spooked.

1374
01:36:14,750 --> 01:36:16,160
There are much more of us

1375
01:36:16,380 --> 01:36:17,870
and we got military training...

1376
01:36:18,050 --> 01:36:18,920
Instead

1377
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,920
how about we try negotiating
with the Japanese?

1378
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:28,010
To be honest, Japanese are
more enlightened than us,

1379
01:36:28,090 --> 01:36:28,760
if we try dialogue...

1380
01:36:28,840 --> 01:36:29,590
Dialogue my ass!

1381
01:36:29,670 --> 01:36:31,470
If they were sensible, would
we be living this way?

1382
01:36:31,550 --> 01:36:35,470
Remember the Kanto Earthquake?

1383
01:36:35,550 --> 01:36:39,880
They spread rumors that
Koreans poisoned the wells.

1384
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:43,530
How could they say such
a thing and treat us like crap.

1385
01:36:44,300 --> 01:36:47,050
You say that because you
have skills and lived easy.

1386
01:36:47,130 --> 01:36:49,220
Who says I lived easy?

1387
01:36:49,300 --> 01:36:51,920
You're just trying to divide us, painter!

1388
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,090
Hey!

1389
01:36:53,170 --> 01:36:55,130
Just decide who'd leave or stay.

1390
01:36:55,210 --> 01:36:56,590
This is wasting time.

1391
01:36:56,670 --> 01:36:57,670
He's right.

1392
01:36:58,250 --> 01:37:00,910
Those who want to go, can go.

1393
01:37:01,050 --> 01:37:02,470
Those who will stay, stay.

1394
01:37:02,550 --> 01:37:06,160
You really think they'd
kill so many people?

1395
01:37:06,340 --> 01:37:07,760
- Right?
- Yeah!

1396
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:09,660
Daddy, aren't we going?

1397
01:37:10,670 --> 01:37:13,920
Damn it, I'm going to blow my top.

1398
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,160
You stupid Koreans!

1399
01:37:16,670 --> 01:37:19,780
If you made it this far,
shouldn't you try to live?

1400
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:21,920
Have you all grown

1401
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,820
so used to being stepped on?

1402
01:37:24,090 --> 01:37:25,490
My goodness.

1403
01:37:25,710 --> 01:37:27,620
This girl and I want to live.

1404
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:30,300
We'll go ourselves.

1405
01:37:30,380 --> 01:37:33,490
Wait! I'll go too.

1406
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:36,800
I lost my leg and became a cripple

1407
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:40,450
but I won't let them bury me here.

1408
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:44,240
But Mallyon, what if
they really kill us all?

1409
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,630
Even if just one of us survives, we win.

1410
01:37:47,710 --> 01:37:48,990
Just one.

1411
01:37:49,380 --> 01:37:51,300
My life was ruined

1412
01:37:51,380 --> 01:37:53,530
but I won't die in their hands.

1413
01:37:53,750 --> 01:37:54,910
Wait

1414
01:37:57,840 --> 01:37:59,450
I'll go too.

1415
01:38:21,130 --> 01:38:22,170
Are you really staying?

1416
01:38:22,250 --> 01:38:25,010
How can you trust them?
You should think it over.

1417
01:38:25,090 --> 01:38:28,760
Come on, we'll try talking to the Japanese!

1418
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:29,340
Let's go!

1419
01:38:29,420 --> 01:38:31,490
There's no time, so we
won't try to persuade you.

1420
01:38:32,050 --> 01:38:33,590
Are you crazy? What's going on?

1421
01:38:33,670 --> 01:38:36,990
You telling them of our
plan is only trouble.

1422
01:38:37,300 --> 01:38:38,720
So please understand.

1423
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:40,240
And besides

1424
01:38:40,670 --> 01:38:43,300
it'd be best if they found you tied up.

1425
01:38:43,380 --> 01:38:44,340
Don't need this.

1426
01:38:44,420 --> 01:38:46,620
Stabbing me first then
apologizing is useless.

1427
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:49,370
Careful, careful...

1428
01:38:53,710 --> 01:38:56,320
Wait, I don't see Choi Chil-sung's gang.

1429
01:38:56,630 --> 01:38:58,590
If they tell the labor attendant...

1430
01:38:58,670 --> 01:39:01,550
They said they're going to rescue Choi.

1431
01:39:01,630 --> 01:39:02,630
Huh?

1432
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:04,660
What'll they do then?

1433
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,240
Let's hurry.

1434
01:39:15,090 --> 01:39:16,090
Boss.

1435
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:18,160
What are you doing here?

1436
01:39:19,960 --> 01:39:21,880
They say they'll try you.

1437
01:39:21,960 --> 01:39:23,990
Let's go before things get worse.

1438
01:39:24,460 --> 01:39:27,570
Think of this as a drill, like in training.

1439
01:39:28,630 --> 01:39:31,740
We're going to move in groups.

1440
01:39:32,840 --> 01:39:34,240
<i>When we're ready</i>

1441
01:39:34,380 --> 01:39:36,550
<i>women, the wounded,</i>

1442
01:39:36,630 --> 01:39:38,410
<i>and children will move first at our sign.</i>

1443
01:39:39,590 --> 01:39:40,950
<i>Our final goal</i>

1444
01:39:41,670 --> 01:39:44,660
<i>is to cross the coal belt over the wall,</i>

1445
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:47,030
<i>board the ship, and escape.</i>

1446
01:39:48,550 --> 01:39:51,070
This is dynamite they
prepared for the mine.

1447
01:39:51,340 --> 01:39:54,050
<i>Explosives team, tie them
to the lantern batteries.</i>

1448
01:39:54,130 --> 01:39:55,700
<i>It will strengthen the blast.</i>

1449
01:39:56,670 --> 01:39:59,740
<i>The wounded, use tatami
mats to make shields.</i>

1450
01:40:00,710 --> 01:40:04,910
<i>Mallyon and the women will make
rope from fundoshi underwear.</i>

1451
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:10,370
<i>Weapons team, take tools and
oil from the tool factory.</i>

1452
01:40:11,750 --> 01:40:16,370
<i>Lee and his band will gather
bottles for bottle bombs.</i>

1453
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:51,950
Those who can steer the
ship, help me take control.

1454
01:40:52,250 --> 01:40:56,740
The rest of you, wait for our signal.

1455
01:40:58,630 --> 01:41:00,420
It's dangerous, don't touch.

1456
01:41:00,500 --> 01:41:04,320
Why do you always yell at me?

1457
01:41:51,670 --> 01:41:53,030
Why are you here?

1458
01:41:54,340 --> 01:41:56,320
If you're ready, I'll bring everyone.

1459
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:05,530
Don't do this, come with us.

1460
01:42:06,130 --> 01:42:10,050
You really think 400 people
can sneak onto a ship?

1461
01:42:10,130 --> 01:42:12,970
With all those wounded people?

1462
01:42:13,050 --> 01:42:15,370
Then do you want to start a war here?

1463
01:42:16,050 --> 01:42:18,280
We'll all die tomorrow anyway.

1464
01:42:20,130 --> 01:42:22,240
If you try to kill Jong-go, you'll die too!

1465
01:42:40,750 --> 01:42:41,750
Hey.

1466
01:42:42,170 --> 01:42:44,510
Did Park go without finishing them off?

1467
01:42:44,590 --> 01:42:46,550
They weren't here before.

1468
01:42:46,630 --> 01:42:47,820
Damn it.

1469
01:42:56,380 --> 01:42:56,970
Who's there?

1470
01:42:57,050 --> 01:42:58,510
It's me!

1471
01:42:58,590 --> 01:42:59,510
Shishido, it's me.

1472
01:42:59,590 --> 01:43:00,620
Gang-ok.

1473
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:03,280
Why are you out so late? Go back inside.

1474
01:43:05,210 --> 01:43:07,700
I can't believe it either.

1475
01:43:09,300 --> 01:43:10,780
Get over here, quick.

1476
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:16,260
With the big event tomorrow

1477
01:43:16,340 --> 01:43:18,590
Yamada said to bring the girls
and pour everyone a drink.

1478
01:43:18,670 --> 01:43:19,970
Since you guys have it hardest

1479
01:43:20,050 --> 01:43:21,800
I brought some girls... you know?

1480
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:22,990
Really?

1481
01:43:23,300 --> 01:43:24,670
Where's the alcohol from?

1482
01:43:24,750 --> 01:43:27,660
Shimazaki had it stashed away

1483
01:43:28,300 --> 01:43:29,880
and Yamada took it out.

1484
01:43:29,960 --> 01:43:32,910
Just one drink for each of you.

1485
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,880
If it's just one, better not to have any.

1486
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:38,740
We'll give it a taste.

1487
01:43:39,050 --> 01:43:41,660
Come this way.

1488
01:43:59,210 --> 01:44:01,530
Bro! Quickly!

1489
01:44:37,170 --> 01:44:39,070
Women and the wounded first.

1490
01:44:42,300 --> 01:44:44,370
Can we really do this?

1491
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:47,380
I don't see any guards.

1492
01:44:47,460 --> 01:44:50,920
I spent so much on Korean girls

1493
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:52,420
if the manager finds out he'll be mad.

1494
01:44:52,500 --> 01:44:54,630
Who will know we started the fire?

1495
01:44:54,710 --> 01:44:58,630
They'll think the Koreans
kicked over a candle.

1496
01:44:58,710 --> 01:45:00,450
While they were sleeping.

1497
01:45:05,500 --> 01:45:08,280
Out of the way.

1498
01:45:08,380 --> 01:45:09,700
Go back.

1499
01:45:10,670 --> 01:45:13,340
Hey, it's women and the wounded first

1500
01:45:13,420 --> 01:45:14,880
I'm wounded too.

1501
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:17,880
And she's a young girl.

1502
01:45:17,960 --> 01:45:19,420
Shouldn't we board first?

1503
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:22,420
Bro! Don't you have any shame?

1504
01:45:22,500 --> 01:45:24,820
Take a look at these people!

1505
01:45:29,340 --> 01:45:31,220
Damn it.

1506
01:45:31,300 --> 01:45:34,880
Then at least let Sohee go first.

1507
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:36,620
No!

1508
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,160
Go.

1509
01:46:24,090 --> 01:46:26,280
Get up there, kid.

1510
01:46:35,090 --> 01:46:36,570
The sun will be up soon.

1511
01:46:37,630 --> 01:46:41,820
If you see a cripple go,
you can follow, right?

1512
01:46:52,840 --> 01:46:55,880
You'll be fine if you follow me.

1513
01:46:55,960 --> 01:46:57,660
So you come next.

1531
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:35,370
The Koreans are escaping.

1532
01:48:42,420 --> 01:48:43,660
They've been spotted.

1533
01:48:46,460 --> 01:48:48,990
I'll join you, so you go first.

1534
01:48:49,960 --> 01:48:52,200
I keep my promises.

1535
01:48:54,300 --> 01:48:56,470
As they board the ship

1536
01:48:56,550 --> 01:48:58,070
we'll watch their backs.

1537
01:49:05,380 --> 01:49:07,370
You guys in the front, move.

1538
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:05,160
The Koreans started a fire!

1539
01:50:06,130 --> 01:50:08,200
The Koreans are escaping!

1540
01:50:10,420 --> 01:50:12,160
There! Over there!

1541
01:50:22,630 --> 01:50:24,700
Check the back! Quickly!

1542
01:50:36,460 --> 01:50:37,620
Don't move in the back.

1543
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:12,200
Snipers! Explosives!

1544
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:36,030
Hold on.

1545
01:52:18,840 --> 01:52:20,370
It's a real war.

1546
01:52:21,090 --> 01:52:23,030
Kill every last one of them.

1547
01:52:39,420 --> 01:52:41,990
You rotten bastards.

1548
01:52:58,920 --> 01:53:01,820
Sohee, stay right here.

1549
01:53:08,630 --> 01:53:11,910
Kill every one of them.

1550
01:53:28,250 --> 01:53:30,120
- Stop shooting!
- That way!

1551
01:53:41,170 --> 01:53:43,320
Fuck, just let us go home.

1552
01:53:44,090 --> 01:53:51,570
I said this would never work!
From the very start!

1553
01:53:54,420 --> 01:53:57,320
Sohee! Hide, quickly!

1554
01:53:57,710 --> 01:53:58,990
Go back, you.

1555
01:54:13,550 --> 01:54:17,340
Lift! With all your strength!

1556
01:54:17,420 --> 01:54:19,620
Go over the wall and into the water.

1557
01:54:19,920 --> 01:54:21,490
Snipers and explosive team, move!

1558
01:54:21,710 --> 01:54:23,200
The rest of you, lift.

1559
01:54:31,250 --> 01:54:33,410
Light them here.

1560
01:54:35,250 --> 01:54:38,990
Let's fight to death!

1561
01:54:45,420 --> 01:54:48,070
1, 2, 3.

1562
01:55:05,920 --> 01:55:07,780
Dae-yeop

1563
01:55:14,050 --> 01:55:17,160
1, 2, 3.

1564
01:55:20,380 --> 01:55:23,160
Lift it.

1565
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:29,370
Lift it.

1566
01:55:33,090 --> 01:55:36,490
Sohee, hide here.

1567
01:55:37,880 --> 01:55:40,160
Follow me, guys.

1568
01:55:50,170 --> 01:55:52,280
Bring this.

1569
01:55:55,210 --> 01:55:56,740
Help me.

1570
01:55:59,210 --> 01:56:01,240
Spread it out.

1571
01:56:01,380 --> 01:56:02,450
Spread it out.

1572
01:56:03,090 --> 01:56:04,320
Spread it out.

1573
01:56:08,710 --> 01:56:09,710
Throw!

1574
01:56:14,550 --> 01:56:16,320
Grab the rope and follow me.

1575
01:56:23,250 --> 01:56:25,130
Bullets! I'm out of bullets!

1576
01:56:25,210 --> 01:56:26,760
Bayonets!

1577
01:56:26,840 --> 01:56:27,840
Charge!

1578
01:56:31,050 --> 01:56:34,740
Bastards! We don't deserve this!

1579
01:56:35,880 --> 01:56:36,910
Daddy!

1580
01:56:37,130 --> 01:56:40,990
Get back there Sohee, it's dangerous!

1581
01:56:46,500 --> 01:56:48,200
Pull the rope!

1582
01:56:49,300 --> 01:56:52,450
1, 2, 3...

1583
01:57:12,550 --> 01:57:13,570
Pull out.

1584
01:57:15,590 --> 01:57:18,070
Chil-sung, you asshole!

1585
01:57:19,340 --> 01:57:21,410
Come back here, bastard!

1586
01:57:25,250 --> 01:57:26,300
Pull it back, quick!

1587
01:57:26,380 --> 01:57:27,450
Pull it back!

1588
01:57:30,420 --> 01:57:32,120
What are you holding back for?

1589
01:57:32,550 --> 01:57:33,870
Move!

1590
01:57:36,840 --> 01:57:37,910
Pull the rope!

1591
01:57:42,840 --> 01:57:44,120
Pull!

1592
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:47,240
Now push it!

1593
01:57:47,550 --> 01:57:49,820
A little more!

1594
01:57:50,170 --> 01:57:51,570
Lift it up!

1595
01:57:52,090 --> 01:57:53,570
Push!

1596
01:57:54,130 --> 01:57:55,490
That's it!

1597
01:58:00,130 --> 01:58:01,030
Climb up.

1598
01:58:01,130 --> 01:58:03,200
Everyone climb up.

1599
01:58:03,420 --> 01:58:05,010
Let the wounded climb up.

1600
01:58:05,090 --> 01:58:06,410
Sohee, where are you?

1601
01:58:06,920 --> 01:58:07,920
Daddy.

1602
01:58:09,210 --> 01:58:10,820
Sohee.

1603
01:58:36,420 --> 01:58:37,450
Hey.

1604

Come on guys!

1605
01:58:47,130 --> 01:58:48,620
Get up!

1606
01:59:08,420 --> 01:59:09,990
Bastard!

1607
02:00:13,090 --> 02:00:15,280
Sorry for not keeping my promise.

1608
02:00:24,170 --> 02:00:25,450
You can rest now.

1609
02:00:38,130 --> 02:00:39,870
I'm on your side!

1610
02:00:40,500 --> 02:00:43,280
Kill all the Koreans,
whatever side they're on!

1611
02:00:50,170 --> 02:00:51,490
Kill them all.

1612
02:00:52,460 --> 02:00:55,950
- Bro! What do we do?
- Keep climbing.

1613
02:00:56,550 --> 02:00:57,410
Sung-il!

1614
02:00:57,550 --> 02:00:58,550
Sung-il!

1615
02:01:11,550 --> 02:01:12,410
Sung-il!

1616
02:01:12,550 --> 02:01:13,550
Sung-il!

1618
02:01:24,670 --> 02:01:25,800
Sohee, stay there!

1619
02:01:25,880 --> 02:01:27,620
Stay there.

1620
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,030
Daddy! Daddy!

1621
02:01:44,210 --> 02:01:45,820
I've got you now.

1622
02:01:53,340 --> 02:01:55,870
Dirty Koreans!

1623
02:01:57,130 --> 02:01:59,880
Why aren't you grateful?

1624
02:01:59,960 --> 02:02:01,200
Why!

1625
02:02:44,340 --> 02:02:46,120
It's all over now.

1626
02:02:49,050 --> 02:02:54,910
Your manager and Yamada are dead.

1627
02:02:59,670 --> 02:03:04,200
Now we're going back to our home!

1628
02:03:23,250 --> 02:03:24,990
Daddy.

1629
02:03:25,920 --> 02:03:27,570
Boss...

1630
02:04:40,920 --> 02:04:43,240
I'm not going to die.

1631
02:04:44,340 --> 02:04:45,700
Why are you crying?

1632
02:04:47,130 --> 02:04:48,130
Stop!

1633
02:04:50,710 --> 02:04:52,450
Go over there, Sohee

1634
02:04:59,210 --> 02:05:02,120
I'm older, so let me ask you a favor.

1635
02:05:05,050 --> 02:05:09,660
Give her some soy noodles with sugar.

1636
02:05:11,880 --> 02:05:13,700
That's what she likes best.

1637
02:05:32,960 --> 02:05:38,740
Please look after my girl.

1638
02:06:03,670 --> 02:06:05,870
Sorry I couldn't give you anything.

1639
02:06:21,170 --> 02:06:27,410
Don't turn your nose up at raw eggs.

1640
02:06:33,550 --> 02:06:36,530
Sing a song for me.
