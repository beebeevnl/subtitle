1
0:0:0.332 --> 0:0:1.400
All right!

2
0:0:2.635 --> 0:0:3.970
Statesmen, the vote.

3
0:0:6.971 --> 0:0:8.940
Looks like she's in.

4
0:0:8.974 --> 0:0:10.275
Have a seat.

5
0:0:11.508 --> 0:0:12.578
(CHUCKLES)

6
0:0:14.813 --> 0:0:16.581
To Agent Whiskey!

7
0:0:16.614 --> 0:0:17.749
Agent Whiskey!

8
0:0:25.356 --> 0:0:26.425
Cheers!

9
0:0:31.262 --> 0:0:33.666
Are you sure
I don't look like a dick?

10
0:0:36.568 --> 0:0:37.636
Look in the mirror.

11
0:0:43.675 --> 0:0:45.043
What do you see?

12
0:0:45.077 --> 0:0:48.579
Someone who can't believe
what the fuck is going on.

13
0:0:48.613 --> 0:0:49.847
(SIGHS)

14
0:0:49.882 --> 0:0:51.617
I see a man who is honorable...

15
0:0:53.818 --> 0:0:55.087
brave...

16
0:0:55.787 --> 0:0:57.456
loyal...

17
0:0:57.489 --> 0:0:59.759
who's fulfilled
his huge potential.

18
0:1:1.426 --> 0:1:3.796
A man who's done
something good with his life.

19
0:1:5.096 --> 0:1:7.332
I owe you everything, Harry.

20
0:1:8.600 --> 0:1:10.002
Thank you.

21
0:1:10.034 --> 0:1:11.336
Don't mention it.

22
0:1:12.604 --> 0:1:13.606
You ready?

23
0:1:16.574 --> 0:1:18.510
Not a doubt in my mind.

24
0:1:56.882 --> 0:1:59.085
(ALL CHEERING)

25
0:2:10.195 --> 0:2:13.097
HARRY: As one of our
founding Kingsman once said...

26
0:2:13.131 --> 0:2:15.100
this is not the end.

27
0:2:15.133 --> 0:2:18.270
It is not even the beginning
of the end.

28
0:2:18.302 --> 0:2:22.774
But it is, perhaps,
the end of the beginning.

29
0:2:23.542 --> 0:2:24.810
Yeah!
