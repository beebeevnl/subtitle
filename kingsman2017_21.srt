What's the matter?
Nothing.

3
0:0:18.668 --> 0:0:20.068
I just feel that
our spirit animals

4
0:0:20.102 --> 0:0:21.771
need more time to get in sync...

5
0:0:21.805 --> 0:0:25.174
and find a harmonious bond
on the spiritual plane.

0:0:25.206 --> 0:0:26.409
Totally.

0:0:26.441 --> 0:0:27.809
Yeah?

0:0:27.843 --> 0:0:30.347
Or we could just...

fuck?

10
0:0:38.688 --> 0:0:39.990
Clara, I don't think I can.

0:0:49.798 --> 0:0:51.733
But you know what?

I'm in a relationship.

Yeah, can you put me through

Oh, actually, sir, I'm just
looking at my computer...
