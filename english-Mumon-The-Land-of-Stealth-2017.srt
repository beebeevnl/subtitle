00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:22,260
Soon, our country will likely follow suit.

163
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:26,720
(Council of 12 Iga Jounin Houses)

164
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,110
- Uzura.
- Yes.

165
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,270
Who killed Kitabatake Tomonori?

166
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:38,060
I believe it was "Daizen".

167
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,300
What?

168
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,970
If it's Daizen... that's the
former vassal of Tomonori, wasn't it?

169
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:47,270
Among his vassals,
he was considered THE protege of proteges.

170
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,900
Then, what shall we do?

171
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,410
I didn't expect they'll come invading this soon.

172
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,650
Right, Shimoyama?

173
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,300
Yeah.

174
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:01,380
If they're planning to guard against us,
they'll need to build a castle fort, right?

175
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:02,840
A castle fort?

176
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,990
In our territory?

177
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,730
For sure, Nobunaga will resort to such means.

178
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:12,400
If they ever do build a castle here,
we are finished.

179
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:16,560
We must convey to Oda's men...

180
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,220
That we do not have even the slightest intention
to go against Nobunaga.

181
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,980
Hey, Mumon.

182
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,870
If we're going to war with Oda...

183
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,770
...who's going to pay us?

184
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:31,330
Yeah.

185
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:36,080
Military commanders of other countries
hire us for our skills (as assassins and spies).

186
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,980
With that money, we're barely able to survive.

187
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:44,270
But who's going to pay us,
if we fight for this Iga?

188
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:59,180
The Council of 12 Houses has made a decision.

189
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:05,100
If we fight against Oda,
our country will be destroyed.

190
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,380
We of Iga...

191
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:11,590
...will surrender to Oda.

192
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:17,590
In line with this, we'll assign someone
to send our message to Ise.

193
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,690
Shimoyama Heibee.

194
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:25,820
Bunzo of Momoji Clan,
you will accompany him.

195
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:26,580
Aye!

196
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,410
Depart immediately.

197
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:32,610
Convey our intention to Oda Nobukatsu.

198
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:39,150
If we surrender to Oda,
who's going to pay us?

199
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:42,380
Wouldn't it be Oda?

200
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,410
I'm home!

201
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,190
Welcome back.

202
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:16,370
Uh, here...

203
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,300
A hundred mon.

204
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,660
So, I'm wondering...

205
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:25,720
...that maybe it's time you'll
let me back in my house?

206
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:46,660
Mumon-dono.

207
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,680
Yes?

208
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:51,480
I do not accept this.

209
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:58,920
When you took me away
from my country of Aki...

210
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,450
...do you remember what you said?

211
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:34,060
<i>You are already under my spell.</i>

212
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:38,920
<i>You shall not speak.</i>

213
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,370
<i>Just continue to listen to my voice and...</i>

214
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,250
<i>Are you a Shinobi?</i>

215
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:45,200
<i>Huh?</i>

216
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:53,370
I was fairly certain you're a Shinobi.
A Shinobi from Iga too.

217
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:58,280
Since you said I will no longer
worry about money for the rest of my life...

218
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:02,050
...I agreed to run away with you
to Iga as husband and wife.

219
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:05,170
That's what you said, wasn't it?

220
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:06,760
Well, it was something like that but...

221
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,190
You DID say that, didn't you?

222
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,150
Yes, I did.

223
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,430
Instead, what is this?

224
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:16,970
It's money.

225
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,970
100 mon of eirakusen.

226
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:25,360
For this whole year, how much money
have you earned all in all?

227
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:29,140
Well, if you include this 100 mon...

228
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,800
- That would total to one kan and 300 mon, right?
- It's one kan and 386 mon!

229
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,720
As a requirement for a married couple...

230
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,290
...how much would one
need to live well together?

231
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,540
I think in a year,
you'll need around 40 kan.

232
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,620
What you bring home
isn't at all enough, is it?

233
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,650
It's off by a wide margin, right?

234
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:56,890
Having that kind of manner, do you honestly
want us to live together as husband and wife?

235
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:58,650
I do. Of course I do.

236
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:03,400
All you do is shinobi work...
if you come to think of it...

237
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:07,780
...it's just equal to being
a peasant in Iga, isn't it?

238
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:10,480
In the first place...

239
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,980
...what's up with that
strange name of "Mumon".

240
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:18,390
What do you mean when you said
you can't tell me your real name!?

241
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,960
Mumon-dono!

242
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,400
Huh? You're back early.

243
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:34,190
Welcome back.

244
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:53,720
"He... Eh... Be... Eh...
Ha.. D.. At... Tak... Mi".

245
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,610
("Heibee had attacked me")

246
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:57,170
Boss...
("Heibee had attacked me")

247
00:27:57,170 --> 00:28:00,830
Shimoyama Heibee betrayed us.

248
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:10,380
That boy...

249
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:13,570
...hated Iga that much, huh.

250
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,530
"Attack Iga"?

251
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:33,840
A person from Iga is saying we
should attack his own country?

252
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,650
My lord...

253
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:39,710
This person might have been instructed by
the Council of 12 Houses.

254
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:45,200
We will clearly fall into their trap
if we hastily attack Iga.

255
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:49,280
But when it comes to the
honesty of an Iga soldier...

256
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,260
At the most...

257
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:54,380
...they number from three to four thousand.

258
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,160
That number isn't even half of our troops!

259
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,080
Have you forgotten...

260
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,260
My father's words.

261
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,630
"Iga may be a tribe of savage beasts...

262
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:09,280
...but they treasure their country fervently.

263
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:11,680
...We cannot invade it so easily."

264
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:16,600
Attacking Iga is out of the question!

265
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:21,510
Pardon me but...

266
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:29,070
...is that what your Lordship truly feels?

267
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,640
You... what are you trying to say!

268
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,150
You may continue.

269
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,540
I am certain...

270
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:42,700
"Nobukatsu-sama can invade Iga
with his own power"...

271
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:47,540
...is what your father actually
meant for you to hear.

272
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:51,160
Are you...
trying to trick his Lordship!

273
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:55,360
My lord, you shouldn't
listen to this Iga person!

274
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,320
Well, it's true...

275
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:01,640
That when your father Nobunaga was young,
he did things to suit his own convenience.

276
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:05,690
As an enemy that doesn't know anything about warfare,
3000 men is just some unruly mob...

277
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:08,530
...compared to our powerful troop
of 10,000 soldiers.

278
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:10,930
It's as easy as snatching sweets
from a baby's hand.

279
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:14,530
My lord, let us have our troops bring down Iga.

280
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,930
It's a good opportunity to mow down Iga in one go,
now that they're not unified under one ruler.

281
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,050
I want to see his Lordship's bravery in battle...

282
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:22,190
You are a bunch of laughs,
each one of you!

283
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:27,680
Do not underestimate the Shinobi.

284
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:31,690
There's no military merit you can gain
in eliminating them.

285
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,630
An act such as fighting the weak...

286
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:39,330
...is something I, Heki Daizen
refuses to do!

287
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:41,930
I have decided.

288
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,800
We will attack Iga!

289
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,700
I knew we'll do it!

290
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:53,900
Then...

291
00:30:54,800 --> 00:31:00,120
I propose that you keep a watchful eye on Iga,
by building a castle fort within their territory.

292
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:03,050
And I just have...

293
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:06,890
...the perfect idea on
how you can do it.

294
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:14,970
<i>As to where
they can build that castle...</i>

295
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,180
<i>It's right here, right in the middle of Iga.</i>

296
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:22,790
<i>The people of Iga will not permit it but...</i>

297
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:28,560
Building Oda's castle
on our land is preposterous!

298
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:34,410
Indeed, it's not an offer
even worth drinking to.

299
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:40,460
No no. It's not a matter of
building an Oda castle.

300
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:43,380
If esteemed council members such as yourselves
want a befitting place to seclude yourselves...

301
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:47,080
...this Heirakuji (shrine) is
indeed too cramp for you.

302
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:52,530
How about your own castle with stone walls
and surrounded by a moat?

303
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:55,530
Such a thing can happen (with this).

304
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:59,880
If you wish, it can have features like
inner and outer citadels, and a fortress too.

305
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,730
It can also have an oguchi*, or even an alternate entrance.
(*Having one gate entrance/exit)

306
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:06,400
You can build it any way you wish.

307
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:12,660
Furthermore, in exchange for gaining rights to your land...

308
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:17,360
His Lordship Oda Nobukatsu would like
to welcome you as the Oda Clan's vassal state.

309
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:34,240
Well, that is what we wanted
in the beginning.

310
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:36,970
Right?

311
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:42,290
We had no desire to go against you.

312
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:48,400
We are accepting Oda Nobukatsu's
proposal to become a vassal state.

313
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,280
That is what this Council has decided.

314
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:55,940
With that, as a symbol of peace
between our two countries...

315
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:59,780
...we will build a castle fort on Maruyama.

316
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,580
What? What about our fields?

317
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:07,560
What the hell?
I won't do it even if you pay me.

318
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,850
Furthermore...

319
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:16,680
...the Oda Clan will pay those
who will participate in the construction.

320
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:24,540
Your wage for each day of work...

321
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:27,900
...is a hundred...

322
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,470
...and fifty mon!!

323
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,030
I'll do it!

324
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,550
For each day?

325
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:36,510
That much for each day!

326
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:39,730
150 mon for each day of work!

327
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,830
Work hard, everyone!

328
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:52,170
All right~!

329
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:24,940
I can't believe how stupid they are.

330
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,140
Shimoyama Heibee said it, right?

331
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:31,360
"Throw them some money and
they'll treat you like a master."

332
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,130
They're not much different from a scoundrel.

333
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:35,850
What?

334
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:48,520
♫ Ah, I hate it, I hate this

335
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:53,980
♫ I hate sawing work

336
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:59,300
♫ Even cows get to sleep, dammi~t

337
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,880
No resting!

338
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,080
Do you know how much you're being paid!?

339
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,580
What is this...

340
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,010
What did you just...

341
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,230
I told you not to do such a thing.

342
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:14,340
We could lose our jobs.

343
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,210
Oh, right.

344
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:19,320
Hey, what are you doing.
Don't just go stealing that.

345
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,700
What's going on there!

346
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,440
- Hey!
- Oh, right.

347
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,210
- Name?
- It's Dengo!

348
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:33,700
- Dengo?
- Yes.

349
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:36,420
Here's 150 mon. Next!

350
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,330
- Name?
- Risuke!

351
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:39,650
150 mon. Next!

352
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:41,640
Name?

353
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,700
- Mumon.
- 150 mon.

354
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:57,690
Here's today's allowance.

355
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:04,050
Thank you for your hard work.

356
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:11,930
The Oda Clan is extremely powerful, aren't they?

357
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,770
Well, since they're about to
take over all the countries...

358
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:18,820
...they have to have lots of money.

359
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:22,680
With today's allowance,
you have 44 kan left to go.

360
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:28,540
But...

361
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:32,480
Building the castle will come
to an end too someday, right?

362
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:38,370
If it's over, then you know...
my allowance will also be...

363
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,500
Next!

364
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:54,050
I'm ready.

365
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:17,900
Please stop!

366
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:25,120
Hey, you almost hit her!

367
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:27,120
Oh, is that you, Mumon?

368
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,500
Sorry, I didn't see you there.

369
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,230
Nezumi, get out of the way!

370
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,680
Next!

371
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:42,260
Nezumi-san, what's your name?

372
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,600
It's just "Nezumi". Since he's a runt.

373
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:46,180
That's a nickname!

374
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:49,420
That's not what I'm asking,
I'm asking what his real name is...

375
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:54,100
What's the meaning of this!

376
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,070
It's a poisoned dart.

377
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:01,480
- Poison? If he doesn't spit it out right away...
- Yep, he'll die...

378
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,370
...if he's not trained.

379
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,010
Don't touch me!

380
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:19,130
The weak ones will die...
That's the way it is.

381
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:27,330
You were like that too...

382
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:31,920
Well, not really. Because you know,
I'm Iga's best shinobi.

383
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,330
I've been the best since I was a kid,
so that kind of training was nothing to me.

384
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:37,170
Mumon-dono...

385
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:38,640
Yes?

386
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:44,840
Please become a samurai.

387
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:50,720
I heard that a certain Hashiba, who served
the Oda Clan as a sandal bearer foot soldier...

388
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:53,850
...is now a feudal lord of a domain,
and has his own castle.
(She's talking about Toyotomi Hideyoshi)

389
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:57,200
If you truly are Iga's best shinobi...

390
00:38:57,390 --> 00:39:00,970
...such a thing as being samurai
would in no way be a difficult thing for you.

391
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:05,950
Well, no thanks.
I'm fine with the way things are right now.

392
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:09,970
Continue doing occasional
shinobi work...

393
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:14,250
...and living a carefree life like this with you
each day is a small amount of blessing...

394
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:25,360
I'll do it. I'll be a samurai, after all...

395
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:27,520
Okuni-dono!

396
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:31,930
It won't open.

397
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,430
The heck...

398
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,830
Thank you for your long and hard work.

399
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,030
Lord Nobukatsu is also impressed
with the work that people of Iga have done.

400
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,190
What are you saying...

401
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:57,660
It was because of Ise people's
diligent instructions.

402
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:59,520
No...

403
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,000
It may not be much but here is
a congratulatory gift from Lord Nobukatsu.

404
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:10,840
Starting tomorrow, enjoy your deserved rest
from the hard work you did with the castle.

405
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,430
We will now take over
the care of this castle fort.

406
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:17,580
Very well then, thank you very much.

407
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,420
Hurry, hurry.

408
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:35,400
Guard the gate!

409
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,460
Don't ever let an Iga shinobi come inside.

410
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,560
Well then... burn it.

411
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,690
- Burn it!?
- Burn!?

412
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:46,280
You already got paid, right?

413
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:49,310
We have no use for that castle anymore.

414
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:59,530
Look! Dono! Dono!

415
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:08,720
What are you doing! Stand up!

416
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,290
Open the gate!

417
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:16,750
Open the gate!

418
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:20,680
Run away! Everyone, get out!

419
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,430
Release!

420
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,840
Shoot your arrows!

421
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:37,870
Shoot at them!

422
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:46,550
Release! Shoot!

423
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,580
Shinshiro-dono...

424
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:18,450
This after all... was a plan to make us
fall into your trap, wasn't it!

425
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:22,690
I never meant... for this to happen!

426
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:28,180
We shall attack Iga immediately!

427
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:32,240
Sandayuu! What were you thinking!

428
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:37,200
Those Oda men won't keep quiet
about the burning of the castle.

429
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,760
They will surely attack us now!

430
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,300
Oda's army is around 10,000!

431
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,500
They greatly outnumber us, don't they!

432
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:48,190
Shimoyama, you were in this, too.

433
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:52,970
Your son even betrayed us
from the start...

434
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:57,070
What are you up to, by starting a war...

435
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:07,740
What's so funny about this!

436
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:09,150
Sandayuu...

437
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:12,990
Could it be that you...

438
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:15,610
...pulled off a jutsu (trick / technique)?

439
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:24,110
I will not go!

440
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:26,160
What!

441
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,690
I don't care even if it was a trap.

442
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:32,940
They got paid to build a castle.
After they got paid, they burned it.

443
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,440
That's all there was to it.

444
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:41,350
What use is there
in fighting such fools?

445
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:42,890
Heiki-dono...

446
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,040
Daizen, wait. Wait Daizen!

447
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:51,390
What are you thinking!

448
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:53,400
Now that the Maruyama Castle
got burned...

449
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,770
...the young Lord will lose face all the more
if we don't attack Iga.

450
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:57,440
- Why should I care!
- Daizen.

451
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,210
You know it too.

452
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:01,330
There won't be solidarity among us.

453
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:04,560
If you don't fight in the war, many of the
Ise men will follow your example and won't fight either.

454
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:06,110
If so, Iga will...

455
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:08,140
Listen to me, Sakyounosuke!

456
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:13,440
Even if Kitabatake didn't do anything,
he was destroyed nonetheless.

457
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:16,860
Us, killing him like that...

458
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:19,830
...is equal to making fun of a person
on the verge of death.

459
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,800
I will never resort to any act that
resembles bullying the weak...

460
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,920
...ever again!

461
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:31,890
Did you think...

462
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:35,720
...I was fine with
killing our former lord!?

463
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:37,850
But these are troubled times.

464
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:41,690
Those with power are leading the way
to bring peace and unity to all the lands.

465
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:46,200
Will you work for them or against them?

466
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:49,470
You can't have both ways!

467
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:52,870
Nevertheless...

468
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:57,490
I still won't follow orders to destroy them.

469
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:04,220
Listen up, all you men of Iga!

470
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:09,290
The day has come that the Oda army
will attack this Iga.

471
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:11,380
Therefore...

472
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:15,720
We will defend the key points along our
border with Ise, and attack the enemy!

473
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:22,450
I have a question.

474
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:24,130
What is it?

475
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:30,440
If we're going to fight,
I'm wondering who's going to pay us.

476
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:33,160
That's right!

477
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,560
We don't get paid if there's a war.

478
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:40,250
Somebody ought to pay us
for risking our lives for such work!

479
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:44,240
- Yeah!
- That's right!

480
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,120
You fools!

481
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:50,420
You still talk of money
even at a time like this!?

482
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:53,460
Have you forgotten our law!

483
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:56,480
When another country attacks...

484
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:00,990
All men of Iga should sincerely defend
their country with their hearts.

485
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:07,440
If one refuses to follow this law,
his entire family will be killed as way of punishment!

486
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:13,720
All of you, return to your villages immediately,
and prepare for battle!

487
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:19,180
Even though we won't get paid...?

488
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:22,780
You'll fight in a war where
you could wind up dead?

489
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:25,760
And you won't get anything
from it at all?

490
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:31,680
That's why...

491
00:46:31,870 --> 00:46:34,610
Why don't we...

492
00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:38,050
...run away from here?

493
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:42,220
Run? To where?

494
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:46,900
- Maybe to Kyoto...
- How will you make a living in the capital?

495
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:50,760
Well, maybe I'll perform acrobatics,
there's a bit of money there...

496
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:53,250
You mean you will beg.

497
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:55,210
No, not really...

498
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,700
You know I hate your Shinobi job...

499
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:03,130
...and now you're saying
you're going to be a beggar this time?

500
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:08,620
I don't remember discarding my country
to be with a beggar!

501
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:11,110
Yes, you're right.

502
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:13,890
I absolutely hate the idea...

503
00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:16,720
...of running away to another country!

504
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,260
Fine. We'll stay here!

505
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:21,000
All right?

506
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:28,280
War with those Oda guys...

507
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:31,760
...I wonder how I can stop it?

508
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,710
Hey there.

509
00:48:06,290 --> 00:48:10,720
Are you the Nobukatsu brat?

510
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:17,680
How old are you?

511
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,870
21?

512
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:31,820
You look young for that age.

513
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,600
You haven't seen enough of life.

514
00:48:38,970 --> 00:48:44,340
Tonight you will end it,
forget invading Iga.

515
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:51,890
If you won't forget, this Mumon-sama
will return to remind you again.

516
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:53,940
Did you get that?

517
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:57,550
Oda's brat.

518
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:02,680
I am not a brat! I'm Nobukatsu!

519
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:04,570
- It didn't work!
- My lord!

520
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:13,820
You people are a tribe of savage beasts.

521
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:17,660
I, Nobukatsu, will annihilate you all!

522
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:22,930
Whether it be a man, woman, or child,
we will cut all your heads off!

523
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:26,080
And put them on display,
you can be sure of that!

524
00:49:29,730 --> 00:49:32,380
Women and children too?

525
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:35,040
That's right!

526
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:39,920
Even Okuni's head?

527
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,680
Okuni?

528
00:49:42,010 --> 00:49:44,070
Who the hell's that?

529
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:50,000
Don't try that shit on me.

530
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:55,290
If you do, your head is mine.

531
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:02,310
I will personally take your head
in the battlefield.

532
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:06,840
Not only will I trample your
name on the ground...

533
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:10,080
I'll send you down to hell as well.

534
00:50:15,970 --> 00:50:18,100
Hey... my lord, what happened?

535
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:19,540
My lord!

536
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,140
What is this... a jail room?

537
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:44,910
Mumon!

538
00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:50,200
Oh, it's the turncoat!

539
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:51,950
Why did they lock you up?

540
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:53,210
Who's there?

541
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:04,960
- You... did you come to kill me?
- Why would I do that?

542
00:51:05,790 --> 00:51:07,980
Then, why are you here?

543
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,960
"...it does not differ in the slightest amount."

544
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:35,750
"If there is no causality, and it is void of reason..."
(Reciting the writings of Buddhist priest Dougen)

545
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:40,220
"Buddha will never come to this world..."

546
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:41,840
"Bodhidharma..."

547
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,620
Who are you!

548
00:51:44,290 --> 00:51:46,690
Beware of him, your Grace!

549
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:50,970
That person is a disgusting shinobi
who kills, too.

550
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:53,190
What is a shinobi doing here?

551
00:51:53,330 --> 00:51:57,550
Perhaps to assassinate Nobukatsu-sama
but I'm sure he was hired to do it.

552
00:51:57,550 --> 00:52:01,220
No, I didn't come to kill though.

553
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:03,050
Kill Nobukatsu?

554
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:20,110
I heard an Iga shinobi will offer
his services for money.

555
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:25,230
In line with that,
I want you to do something for me.

556
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,830
The enemy of my father Kitabatake Tomonori...

557
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,120
Oda Nobukatsu...

558
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:33,790
I want you to kill him!

559
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:41,900
For how much?

560
00:52:43,170 --> 00:52:44,820
Bring it out.

561
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:46,240
But your Grace!

562
00:52:46,350 --> 00:52:48,170
Do it!

563
00:53:08,490 --> 00:53:11,000
Kitabatake's treasured tea container...

564
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,300
Nicknamed, the Little Aubergine.

565
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:17,580
What that Nobukatsu saw was a cheap imitation.

566
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:20,580
It seems he wasn't able to tell the difference but...

567
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:26,780
This thing costs 10,000 kan.

568
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,760
10,000... kan...

569
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,660
Your Grace!

570
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,420
Don't do it.

571
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:36,110
That bastard is a just a robber
from the tribe of savage beasts...

572
00:53:36,110 --> 00:53:38,130
He won't keep his promise right from the start...

573
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:39,600
Fine, it's a deal then.

574
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,970
Mumon, you bastard!

575
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:44,870
I am pleased.

576
00:53:45,810 --> 00:53:48,230
I have sent out my request.

577
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:53,460
Lord Buddha has heed my prayers.

578
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:57,090
There is no doubt Buddha sent this man to me.

579
00:53:57,890 --> 00:54:03,290
Even if I am powerless, I was finally
able to do what must be done.

580
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:06,630
I no longer...

581
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:10,220
...have any regrets.

582
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:14,380
Mumon...

583
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:18,050
What, you've been grumbling
for a while now.

584
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:23,830
You don't care about
protecting anyone, right?

585
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:33,240
You are not human.

586
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:50,960
Why?

587
00:54:51,530 --> 00:54:54,360
A scoundrel like you wouldn't understand.

588
00:54:57,610 --> 00:55:01,500
She made a request
on which she staked her own life.

589
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:06,960
In this world, there are things...

590
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:10,400
...that are more important than money.

591
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:21,040
I definitely don't understand that.

592
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:23,970
- Was it a shinobi?
- Yes.

593
00:55:23,970 --> 00:55:25,890
He went inside the lord's bedroom.

594
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:27,740
Shut up! Be quiet!

595
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:29,760
I'm ordering all of you to dispatch your troops!

596
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,660
Gather for war at once,
and invade Iga!

597
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:36,170
Daizen! Why did you come!

598
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:38,000
Are you here to laugh at me!

599
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,940
Are you insane?

600
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:44,830
Daizen!

601
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,950
You listen well.

602
00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:49,250
Even if you do not help us...

603
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:53,250
I, Nobukatsu will utterly destroy Iga!

604
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:57,360
What did you say?

605
00:55:57,980 --> 00:55:59,780
What?

606
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,270
What you said just now...

607
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:05,450
Say it again.

608
00:56:05,450 --> 00:56:09,390
I said, even without you,
I will attack Iga!

609
00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:11,440
Sakyounosuke...

610
00:56:12,290 --> 00:56:14,780
What will happen if I do not fight?

611
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:18,420
I told you, many of Ise men will follow you...

612
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:20,370
I bear some news!

613
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,970
The shinobi was spotted at the outer citadel!

614
00:56:22,970 --> 00:56:25,290
What! Was he captured?

615
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:27,860
My Lord! Please calm down!

616
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:31,460
Let me go! Let me go!
You useless people!

617
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:33,880
- Go look for him!
- My lord!

618
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:39,230
I want to hear why you came to Ise.

619
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,840
- Yes.
- What's going on, Daizen.

620
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:45,090
Tell me, what happened in Iga.

621
00:56:48,590 --> 00:56:50,960
My kid brother...

622
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,470
...was killed.

623
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:01,130
It was just a skirmish with
a fellow shinobi clan...

624
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:05,440
They toyed with my brother...

625
00:57:07,950 --> 00:57:14,500
But no one... grieved over his death.

626
00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:20,160
The people of Iga are not human.

627
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:25,250
Such men should not live in this world.

628
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:27,780
That is why...

629
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:31,780
I will bring Oda Nobukatsu's army and attack Iga.

630
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:36,620
I want to rid this world of
those inhuman bastards!

631
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,060
Heibee.

632
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:49,770
You got tricked by the Council's jutsu.

633
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:56,130
That skirmish that happened...

634
00:57:56,130 --> 00:57:59,880
Don't you think it was a trick
so you would betray them?

635
00:58:04,850 --> 00:58:09,140
Are you saying they tricked me?

636
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:13,460
They made use of you because
your character is unlike an Iga person.

637
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:20,900
Look... why did you propose
to us the building of the castle?

638
00:58:21,310 --> 00:58:24,670
<i>If they're planning to guard against us...</i>

639
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:27,090
<i>...they'll need to build
a castle fort, right?</i>

640
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:30,540
<i>If they ever do build a castle here,
we are finished.</i>

641
00:58:30,730 --> 00:58:32,910
That was what you heard...

642
00:58:32,910 --> 00:58:35,050
And they made you hear it.

643
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:41,050
Then it was a plan to have us
make them build the castle?

644
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:45,910
Yes. And they intended to
burn it right from the start.

645
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:48,630
What on earth for?

646
00:58:48,890 --> 00:58:50,860
To lure us in.

647
00:58:52,670 --> 00:58:55,360
Why are we luring in Oda's army?

648
00:58:55,570 --> 00:58:57,900
We don't have a chance against them!

649
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:03,690
Otohano, haven't you noticed that job requests
for our genins have greatly decreased lately?

650
00:59:03,690 --> 00:59:10,310
Well, so far, those employers (from the other countries) have
been destroyed by Oda one after another.

651
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:14,630
If this continues, Iga will be ruined.

652
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:19,250
But what if... we win against Oda...

653
00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:20,920
There's no way we can win!

654
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:22,550
Yes, we can!

655
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:29,890
The man who has a problem
with the coming war will not come to fight.

656
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:33,030
That would be me!

657
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:39,660
Daizen is that sort of guy.

658
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:46,130
Having been forced to take part in killing his former lord,
he holds a grudge against Nobukatsu.

659
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:51,540
If that man is told to lead the troops against Iga,
there's no doubt he'll refuse!

660
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:55,890
It's true that if Daizen won't fight...

661
00:59:55,890 --> 00:59:58,860
His men won't fight either,
cutting the size of their troops into half.

662
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:02,320
If so, Iga will win for sure!

663
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:03,820
And if we win against Oda...

664
01:00:03,950 --> 01:00:07,610
Iga's military prowess will spread throughout the lands...
which means...

665
01:00:07,610 --> 01:00:11,450
Therefore, all the daimyo who are against Oda,
will be left alone..

666
01:00:11,450 --> 01:00:14,820
- Which means?
- The hiring of our genin will increase!

667
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:16,400
And if they increase?

668
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:17,810
We'll earn profits!

669
01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:21,300
And that's what it's about!

670
01:00:29,610 --> 01:00:30,960
Pardon me!

671
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:35,450
I, Heiki Daizen...

672
01:00:35,530 --> 01:00:38,710
...will follow your order to attack Iga.

673
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:42,690
Why now, after refusing all this time!

674
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:45,520
Without me, you will lose.

675
01:00:45,790 --> 01:00:48,490
If so, those people will continue to rile things up.

676
01:00:49,130 --> 01:00:53,400
This was the trick pulled by
Iga's Council of 12 Houses.

677
01:00:57,300 --> 01:01:00,920
You just do what pleases you...

678
01:01:01,650 --> 01:01:06,070
You look highly on yourself,
and says whatever you want!

679
01:01:06,290 --> 01:01:10,520
Even without you, I'll attack Iga!

680
01:01:10,850 --> 01:01:12,410
That goes for the rest of you as well!

681
01:01:12,690 --> 01:01:17,590
If you're not truly willing to follow me,
don't join me in the war!

682
01:01:17,770 --> 01:01:22,070
I will invade Iga with just my troops!

683
01:01:26,690 --> 01:01:29,260
- Heiki-dono!
- Wait, Heki-dono!

684
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:31,530
Do not misunderstand it, boy!

685
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:39,020
Of course, all of the people here are being
subservient to you only because of your father.

686
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:44,040
I will join you in attacking Iga...
not because I'm doing it for you...

687
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:45,920
I'm doing it for myself!!

688
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:48,230
So you admit it, huh!

689
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,470
So what if I did!

690
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:11,120
All of you...

691
01:02:11,530 --> 01:02:14,460
...have no idea how it feels!

692
01:02:17,310 --> 01:02:20,150
Ever since I was born,
I was told to be better than anyone...

693
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:22,880
Not to lose to anybody.

694
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:26,550
Not even to warriors like you who are envied!

695
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:29,280
Do you have any idea how that feels like!

696
01:02:32,090 --> 01:02:39,760
All of you do not like me...
I know that much.

697
01:02:42,820 --> 01:02:44,640
But...

698
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:50,870
...do you know how it is to have
the world's top warlord as a father!

699
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:55,220
No matter what I do,
I can't match him.

700
01:02:55,220 --> 01:02:59,710
Do you all know how it feels like
to have such a father!

701
01:03:18,770 --> 01:03:21,120
I was wrong.

702
01:03:23,010 --> 01:03:26,880
Daizen. Sakyounosuke.

703
01:03:29,310 --> 01:03:35,950
It was wrong of me to make you
kill Kitabatake Tomonori.

704
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:41,240
Forgive me.

705
01:03:56,170 --> 01:03:58,450
My lord!

706
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:05,420
Regarding your father's wish not to invade Iga...

707
01:04:06,930 --> 01:04:12,300
I am sure what his message really meant was...
"Show me you can invade Iga with your power."

708
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:18,290
Therefore, all of us your senior vassals...

709
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:21,800
...will join you in the war!

710
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:30,670
Everyone...

711
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:32,840
...gather your troops...

712
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:37,190
...and converge at the bottom
of the castle immediately!

713
01:05:30,150 --> 01:05:32,370
Okuni, let's run away!

714
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,210
Coward.

715
01:05:45,740 --> 01:05:50,060
Mumon-dono, don't you have any pride?

716
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:52,010
Pride?

717
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:55,450
To protect your country
where you were born and raised.

718
01:05:55,620 --> 01:05:59,150
That too is a person's splendid pride.

719
01:05:59,890 --> 01:06:04,140
Yeah but... there's no money in it.

720
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:06,600
I might get killed too...

721
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:08,790
By the way...

722
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:12,100
I just met Oda's brat a while ago...

723
01:06:12,190 --> 01:06:13,540
You're lying.

724
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:15,390
No, it's true.

725
01:06:15,620 --> 01:06:19,240
It's just what I suspected...

726
01:06:20,030 --> 01:06:25,360
...he said he won't let women
and children live either.

727
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:29,470
Women and children too?

728
01:06:31,730 --> 01:06:36,440
He'll cut off our heads and display it.

729
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:38,730
Women and children too.

730
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:51,060
Okuni-dono! I got hired for a task!

731
01:06:54,590 --> 01:06:58,110
Kitabatake-dono's "Little Aubergine".

732
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:00,560
It's worth 10,000 kan.

733
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:05,580
10,000 kan...?

734
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:08,750
With this, we can set up our own business.

735
01:07:10,110 --> 01:07:12,660
Let's get married in the capital!

736
01:07:22,260 --> 01:07:26,710
From here,
we will split into three groups!

737
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:30,090
My group will invade through
the opening in Iseji in the south!

738
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:34,790
Buzen'nokami-dono's troops will attack,
passing through Bano in the west.

739
01:07:35,130 --> 01:07:39,780
His lord's troops will lead the attack passing
through the opening of Awa in the north.

740
01:07:43,490 --> 01:07:46,340
<i>It was the seventh month in the ninth year
of the Tenshou Era (1579).</i>

741
01:07:46,340 --> 01:07:50,110
<i>Without his father Nobunaga's permission,
Oda Nobukatsu set out with his troops...</i>

742
01:07:50,110 --> 01:07:52,950
<i>...to invade Iga.</i>

743
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:56,590
<i>Their number was around 10,000.</i>

744
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:02,260
<i>Meanwhile, in the targeted country of Iga...</i>
(Awa Opening)

745
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:03,220
(Awa Opening)

746
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:08,080
So Heiki Daizen wasn't among the troops, right?

747
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:09,410
Aye.

748
01:08:11,390 --> 01:08:14,910
Listen up!
When the enemy passes through here...

749
01:08:14,910 --> 01:08:18,370
...they will march by this road under the cliff...

750
01:08:18,370 --> 01:08:19,640
If so...

751
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:22,650
...keep them confined in that
barrier over there...

752
01:08:22,650 --> 01:08:26,330
...and from the top of the cliff,
make it rain arrows on them!

753
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:32,470
Victory is ours!

754
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:35,690
(Bano Opening)

755
01:08:35,690 --> 01:08:37,060
All of you, listen up!
(Bano Opening)

756
01:08:37,850 --> 01:08:43,230
Be the soil! The trees! The rocks!

757
01:08:43,230 --> 01:08:49,440
Make them realize thoroughly the
terrifying techniques of the shinobi!

758
01:08:50,930 --> 01:08:51,140
(Iseji Opening)

759
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:54,100
Nagano Sakyounosuke is headed this way huh...
(Iseji Opening)

760
01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:56,570
We got ourselves an easy win.

761
01:08:59,740 --> 01:09:05,340
Listen up, boys! The one's coming here
is Nagano Sakyounosuke's group!

762
01:09:05,340 --> 01:09:08,130
You don't have the
slightest thing to be afraid of!

763
01:09:08,130 --> 01:09:10,870
It'll be a clean kill with
one sweep of the sword!

764
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:12,740
Aye.

765
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:15,600
What the hell was that!

766
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:19,020
You don't sound enthusiastic!
One more time!

767
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:20,920
Aye.

768
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:25,740
You guys!

769
01:09:25,740 --> 01:09:28,150
Show yourselves!

770
01:09:34,210 --> 01:09:36,160
So few!

771
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:39,520
What the hell is going on!!

772
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,590
Why is there only a few?

773
01:09:45,310 --> 01:09:46,950
Mumon...

774
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:49,640
Where's Mumon!!

775
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:56,050
(Otogi Mountain Pass going to Kyoto)

776
01:09:56,050 --> 01:09:58,080
THIS many people are running away!?
(Otogi Mountain Pass going to Kyoto)

777
01:10:05,150 --> 01:10:09,220
Yeah. Maybe half the people of Iga.

778
01:10:09,790 --> 01:10:12,250
- Half?
- Yep.

779
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:16,150
Iga will lose as soon as it fights.

780
01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:19,420
Get ready!

781
01:10:19,490 --> 01:10:22,450
Position yourselves! Get in your places!

782
01:10:51,930 --> 01:10:53,880
They came from there!?

783
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:55,430
(Awa Opening)

784
01:11:08,170 --> 01:11:11,300
What's... with those many guns!

785
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:13,980
Fire!

786
01:11:25,530 --> 01:11:27,160
Get down!

787
01:11:27,650 --> 01:11:29,360
Get down!

788
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:31,300
All of ya!

789
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:34,430
Bring back those who ran away!

790
01:11:34,430 --> 01:11:37,610
- It's not too late now!
- There's still time!

791
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:47,140
They're early!

792
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:54,930
He's a huge guy!

793
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:58,720
Sakyounosuke is said to be a small man but...

794
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:07,120
That's...

795
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:10,470
- That's Daizen's crest, isn't it!
- It's Daizen!

796
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:13,590
- It's Daizen!
- That isn't Sakyounosuke!

797
01:12:13,590 --> 01:12:15,910
That ain't Sakyounosuke!

798
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:19,450
Pardon me if I'm not Sakyounosuke!

799
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:23,460
I am indeed Daizen!

800
01:12:23,690 --> 01:12:26,260
All you men of Iga...

801
01:12:26,730 --> 01:12:28,930
...your heads are mine.

802
01:12:28,930 --> 01:12:31,010
Prepare to die!

803
01:13:00,210 --> 01:13:02,740
We're going to lose in this war.

804
01:13:06,810 --> 01:13:09,690
(Iseji Opening, Sakyounosuke's Crest
changed to Daizen's crest)

805
01:13:10,110 --> 01:13:13,360
(Bano Opening, Buzen'nokami's crest
changed to Sakyounosuke's crest)

806
01:13:20,850 --> 01:13:24,470
As expected, the enemy is indeed
what I told you about.

807
01:13:24,670 --> 01:13:26,270
I see.

808
01:13:26,270 --> 01:13:28,640
Everyone, get down from your horses.

809
01:13:42,450 --> 01:13:44,650
Why did they stop?

810
01:14:04,750 --> 01:14:06,640
Stab!

811
01:14:06,740 --> 01:14:08,800
Aye!

812
01:14:10,490 --> 01:14:13,350
No way!

813
01:15:04,490 --> 01:15:06,300
What's the matter?

814
01:15:06,820 --> 01:15:08,560
I just remembered that boy...

815
01:15:09,130 --> 01:15:10,080
Who?

816
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:12,740
Nezumi-dono.

817
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:18,750
I wonder if he was able to run away
with his parents just like those children?

818
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:22,100
He doesn't have parents.

819
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:28,040
He was bought from another country
when he was a baby.

820
01:15:31,570 --> 01:15:35,580
Well, the brat's not skilled enough
to escape by himself...

821
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:37,700
So I guess now...

822
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:40,600
He'll be fighting in the war...?

823
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:42,380
Yeah...

824
01:15:42,860 --> 01:15:44,840
Poor kid...

825
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:54,240
A small child like him is made to fight...
and yet you...!

826
01:15:58,510 --> 01:16:02,460
I have changed my mind about running away.

827
01:16:03,170 --> 01:16:05,570
I will join in the fight too!

828
01:16:06,580 --> 01:16:10,080
Huh, wait! Wai- wait a moment!

829
01:16:10,210 --> 01:16:12,540
All right! We'll go! We're going!

830
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:13,790
To where?

831
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:17,020
- To the capital city.
- Mumon-dono!

832
01:16:17,050 --> 01:16:20,410
I'm kidding. To Iga. Iga...

833
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:28,870
Do you plan on going alone?

834
01:16:30,550 --> 01:16:32,780
Well, that's...

835
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:37,970
Here is 10,000 kan!

836
01:17:41,150 --> 01:17:43,830
It's Kitabatake's "Little Aubergine"!

837
01:17:43,980 --> 01:17:50,770
I will give a reward to those who
will join the battle from here!

838
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,980
For every ordinary soldier's head,
you get 10 mon.

839
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:57,270
For each head of a ranking officer,
you get 10 kan.

840
01:17:57,270 --> 01:17:58,970
Ten kan!?

841
01:17:58,970 --> 01:18:01,680
For Nobukatsu's head...

842
01:18:02,030 --> 01:18:04,280
...you get 5,000 kan!

843
01:18:05,350 --> 01:18:07,220
5,000 kan!

844
01:18:08,020 --> 01:18:10,290
All right, I'm in!

845
01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:12,740
Are you going? I'm going to fight!

846
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:15,700
Look look, they're going to fight.

847
01:18:16,780 --> 01:18:19,320
Spread the word to all the genin!

848
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:22,530
To assemble at once at the battlefield!

849
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:26,710
Show them the shinobi techniques you acquired
through many years of training!

850
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:30,720
Now is the time to get big money!

851
01:18:39,310 --> 01:18:41,640
Wait for me at Heirakuji.

852
01:18:45,450 --> 01:18:47,030
Mumon-dono!

853
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:53,830
Be careful.

854
01:18:55,490 --> 01:18:59,790
Make sure you won't die.

855
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:08,080
This is it.

856
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:10,000
It has come!

857
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:12,130
What is it?

858
01:19:12,130 --> 01:19:16,060
I am... Iga's best shinobi.

859
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:20,010
There's no way I'm going to die!

860
01:19:20,980 --> 01:19:23,380
Me! Count me in!

861
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:27,050
Hey! What are you waiting for! It's big money!

862
01:19:48,330 --> 01:19:50,760
That 5,000 kan is mine!

863
01:20:05,250 --> 01:20:07,860
5,000 kan!!

864
01:20:28,410 --> 01:20:30,090
Wait for me.

865
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,520
Kill!

866
01:21:23,870 --> 01:21:25,600
Kill them all!

867
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:33,440
As always, scrambling
to be the first one to escape huh!

868
01:21:37,930 --> 01:21:40,820
No one's following you except
for a scant number of soldiers...

869
01:21:41,850 --> 01:21:45,300
...since you never cared for
anybody but yourself.

870
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:52,640
This is the just punishment you deserve!

871
01:22:00,340 --> 01:22:05,510
I can see that the water in Ise...
has ruined your hearing.

872
01:22:06,220 --> 01:22:08,000
What?

873
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,880
That sound that you can't hear means...

874
01:22:12,530 --> 01:22:16,020
...that you are no longer a shinobi.

875
01:22:20,330 --> 01:22:22,560
Soldier's head, 10 mon...

876
01:22:22,950 --> 01:22:25,760
Officer's head, 10 kan...

877
01:22:25,950 --> 01:22:28,090
Nobukatsu's head, 5000 kan...

878
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:30,170
Is this what you call...

879
01:22:30,770 --> 01:22:33,050
...a scant number of soldiers!?

880
01:22:33,140 --> 01:22:35,040
Officer's head, 10 kan...

881
01:22:35,260 --> 01:22:38,160
Nobukatsu's head, 5000 kan...

882
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:46,270
Hey there, sorry for making you wait.

883
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:48,330
Mumon!

884
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:51,760
All you men of Iga, hear me out!

885
01:22:52,610 --> 01:22:55,280
For every ordinary soldier's head, you get 10 mon!

886
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:57,780
An officer's head is 10 kan.

887
01:22:57,780 --> 01:23:00,290
For Nobukatsu's head, it's 5000 kan!

888
01:23:00,290 --> 01:23:01,540
A soldier's head for 10 mon?

889
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:03,580
An officer's head, 10 kan!

890
01:23:03,580 --> 01:23:05,600
Nobukatsu's head, 5000 kan...

891
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:07,600
Soldier's head, 10 mon...

892
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:09,250
You scoundrels!

893
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:10,960
Stop fooling around!

894
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:12,500
Soldier's head, 10 mon...

895
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:13,970
Officer's head, 10 kan...

896
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:17,170
Nobukatsu's head, 5000 kan!

897
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:27,610
First to get 10 kan for an officer's head...

898
01:23:27,610 --> 01:23:31,620
...is me, Mumon-sama!!

899
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:34,850
Let's go!!

900
01:23:37,540 --> 01:23:40,810
The shinobi has started to fight huh!

901
01:24:05,810 --> 01:24:08,100
Get out of the way!

902
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:42,390
5000 kan!!

903
01:24:44,890 --> 01:24:47,420
I got ten kan!

904
01:24:47,420 --> 01:24:49,330
It's ten kan!

905
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:11,060
Pull me up! Pull me up!

906
01:25:28,180 --> 01:25:31,510
Don't leave me! Protect me!

907
01:25:33,180 --> 01:25:34,910
Mumon!

908
01:25:35,850 --> 01:25:37,890
Mumon, protect me.

909
01:25:37,890 --> 01:25:40,080
Where's the 5000 kan?

910
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:43,380
Nobukatsu's not here. He's at the Awa Opening.

911
01:25:43,470 --> 01:25:44,860
Oh, I'm in the wrong place then!

912
01:25:44,860 --> 01:25:47,370
Heiki Daizen's over at the Iseji Opening.

913
01:25:47,370 --> 01:25:49,500
What? Daizen?

914
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:51,540
He came to fight!?

915
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:55,060
Huh!? Mumon!

916
01:25:55,180 --> 01:25:58,490
Where did you go? Protect me!

917
01:25:58,660 --> 01:26:01,730
So you're the leader here, huh!

918
01:26:05,610 --> 01:26:07,390
Father!

919
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:09,840
Heibee!

920
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:12,440
Father! Father! Come on!

921
01:26:17,060 --> 01:26:19,720
Heibee! Heibee!

922
01:26:22,730 --> 01:26:25,310
Heibee, save me!

923
01:26:25,780 --> 01:26:28,030
Everything I did was for you!

924
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:32,180
I wanted to leave you most of my lands,
even if it's an "ittan" (10th of an hectare)...

925
01:26:32,180 --> 01:26:34,470
I did it for you!!

926
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:38,290
Heibee, save your father!

927
01:26:40,870 --> 01:26:44,690
I no longer have a father.

928
01:26:59,140 --> 01:27:00,560
Yeah, that's right!

929
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:02,920
Sakyounosuke's the name!

930
01:27:05,370 --> 01:27:07,390
Don't you forget it.

931
01:27:22,590 --> 01:27:26,390
Where are ya! 5000 kan!

932
01:27:28,740 --> 01:27:31,710
It's him... Mumon!

933
01:27:32,010 --> 01:27:36,690
Where are ya, Oda's brat!

934
01:27:38,100 --> 01:27:40,100
My name is Nobukatsu!!

935
01:27:40,530 --> 01:27:43,300
It's the 5,000 kan!

936
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:55,360
You have to escape!

937
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:08,390
Our young lord... will surpass his father!!

938
01:28:16,350 --> 01:28:19,270
I just can't run away!

939
01:28:36,570 --> 01:28:38,070
Hey there!

940
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,630
Mumon!

941
01:28:40,690 --> 01:28:42,280
5000 kan!

942
01:28:51,010 --> 01:28:52,420
Shit!

943
01:29:11,790 --> 01:29:15,630
You're Daizen-something, ain't ya?

944
01:29:17,150 --> 01:29:18,900
What's with your damn arrow.

945
01:29:19,790 --> 01:29:23,050
So you're Mumon, huh.

946
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:25,340
Come.

947
01:29:26,900 --> 01:29:29,180
I'm coming even if you don't call me.

948
01:30:12,770 --> 01:30:14,590
You broke it.

949
01:30:24,170 --> 01:30:25,740
You...

950
01:30:26,430 --> 01:30:28,630
Being able to move with that means...

951
01:30:29,820 --> 01:30:33,380
Since I've never removed this in the battlefield...

952
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:38,980
...you wonder how fast
I can move, right?

953
01:30:41,210 --> 01:30:43,660
Even I don't know it.

954
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:47,360
Surround him!

955
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:48,720
Aye!

956
01:31:49,390 --> 01:31:50,660
Die!

957
01:31:50,660 --> 01:31:52,010
My lord!

958
01:32:00,030 --> 01:32:01,710
That hurts...

959
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:11,680
Get down, Daizen!

960
01:33:43,210 --> 01:33:45,680
<i>Soldier's head, 10 mon...</i>

961
01:33:46,190 --> 01:33:48,720
<i>Officer's head, 10 kan...</i>

962
01:33:48,900 --> 01:33:52,280
<i>Nobukatsu's head, 5000 kan...</i>

963
01:33:54,260 --> 01:33:55,750
My lord...

964
01:33:57,770 --> 01:33:59,720
You have to leave now.

965
01:34:01,470 --> 01:34:02,490
Get away.

966
01:34:02,490 --> 01:34:04,810
Soldier's head, 10 mon...

967
01:34:05,060 --> 01:34:07,600
Officer's head, 10 kan...

968
01:34:07,690 --> 01:34:11,370
Nobukatsu's head, 5000 kan...

969
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:18,420
Let me through! Let me through!

970
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:23,400
All of... Ise's troops...

971
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:25,490
...have retreated!

972
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:37,600
What about Mumon-dono?

973
01:34:37,700 --> 01:34:40,880
Do you know what
happened to Mumon-dono?

974
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:42,980
Mumon? He's dead.

975
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:12,020
I was such a fool.

976
01:35:13,890 --> 01:35:15,890
If you're a fool...

977
01:35:16,580 --> 01:35:18,310
...I was a fool too.

978
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:26,900
Sakyounosuke!

979
01:35:27,090 --> 01:35:28,490
You're alive!

980
01:35:28,490 --> 01:35:29,970
Yeah!

981
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:37,040
Those guys...

982
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:40,920
...won't forget my name...

983
01:35:57,680 --> 01:36:01,260
I will throw open the castle for all the soldiers.

984
01:36:01,970 --> 01:36:05,950
Tell everyone to devote
their time in recuperating.

985
01:36:26,270 --> 01:36:28,110
Well done.

986
01:36:31,970 --> 01:36:35,220
You! You're alive, huh.

987
01:37:01,650 --> 01:37:04,330
And he's not alone.

988
01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:06,890
You got that right.

989
01:37:48,450 --> 01:37:49,970
Mumon.

990
01:37:52,430 --> 01:37:54,390
This war...

991
01:37:55,230 --> 01:37:58,400
...was all planned by the Council of 12 Houses.

992
01:38:02,100 --> 01:38:05,540
When you killed my brother...

993
01:38:07,100 --> 01:38:10,120
...it was the Council's way to
lure in Ise's military troops.

994
01:38:10,290 --> 01:38:12,710
It was a plan to crush them.

995
01:38:15,070 --> 01:38:16,920
Mumon.

996
01:38:17,620 --> 01:38:19,700
You and I...

997
01:38:19,700 --> 01:38:24,370
...were puppets whose strings
were pulled by the Council.

998
01:38:27,850 --> 01:38:29,660
So what.

999
01:38:34,820 --> 01:38:36,800
Even if you heard it...

1000
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:39,970
...it doesn't matter to you at all, huh.

1001
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:05,030
It's the Kawa.

1002
01:39:05,160 --> 01:39:08,060
Kawa... Kawa...

1003
01:39:08,190 --> 01:39:11,100
It's the Kawa.

1004
01:39:11,450 --> 01:39:13,130
Kawa!

1005
01:39:23,630 --> 01:39:25,820
Kawa~!

1006
01:39:29,060 --> 01:39:31,410
Even if you kill me...

1007
01:39:33,260 --> 01:39:35,620
...don't touch Nobukatsu
and the Ise men.

1008
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:40,640
Yeah, fine. Whatever.

1009
01:39:41,680 --> 01:39:43,160
Mumon!

1010
01:39:46,240 --> 01:39:47,950
I said fine.

1011
01:39:49,980 --> 01:39:51,720
Please.

1012
01:39:53,630 --> 01:39:55,560
Shall we start?

1013
01:44:47,820 --> 01:44:49,650
I...

1014
01:44:52,120 --> 01:44:54,070
...will die...

1015
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:56,220
...as a human.

1016
01:44:59,620 --> 01:45:01,920
I understand.

1017
01:45:02,450 --> 01:45:04,710
Don't...

1018
01:45:05,020 --> 01:45:07,070
...be mad anymore.

1019
01:45:24,030 --> 01:45:25,900
Daizen.

1020
01:45:28,910 --> 01:45:30,280
What?

1021
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:33,310
Won't you...

1022
01:45:33,700 --> 01:45:36,980
...bury this man in Ise land?

1023
01:45:40,810 --> 01:45:42,610
We will do so.

1024
01:45:46,660 --> 01:45:48,980
Poor guy.

1025
01:46:03,060 --> 01:46:05,210
Nobukatsu!

1026
01:46:06,750 --> 01:46:08,410
Your head...

1027
01:46:08,860 --> 01:46:10,870
Keep it for me, will you?

1028
01:46:15,300 --> 01:46:17,410
Take care of it.

1029
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:23,610
Mumon...

1030
01:46:23,980 --> 01:46:25,620
What does this mean, Mumon...

1031
01:46:25,620 --> 01:46:27,380
What about the 5000 kan...

1032
01:46:27,730 --> 01:46:29,330
Yeah!

1033
01:46:31,020 --> 01:46:32,940
You got a problem?

1034
01:46:35,060 --> 01:46:36,540
No...

1035
01:46:40,600 --> 01:46:41,730
Wai-...

1036
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:27,780
It's Mumon!

1037
01:47:28,290 --> 01:47:30,350
Mumon has returned!

1038
01:47:30,350 --> 01:47:32,700
It's Mumon!!

1039
01:47:37,820 --> 01:47:40,420
So you're alive huh!

1040
01:48:22,410 --> 01:48:24,920
Mumon! Well done!

1041
01:48:25,010 --> 01:48:26,670
Where's the Little Aubergine?

1042
01:48:26,780 --> 01:48:28,840
We heard about it!

1043
01:48:28,840 --> 01:48:31,680
You have it, right?

1044
01:48:32,590 --> 01:48:35,700
Nope. What's that "aubergine"
you're talking about?

1045
01:48:35,890 --> 01:48:37,280
I heard no such thing.

1046
01:48:37,310 --> 01:48:43,240
Oh, c'mon, Mr. Lowly Genin...
Why are ya playin' dumb?

1047
01:49:00,130 --> 01:49:01,870
What do you think you're doing!?

1048
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:08,650
For the sake of your greed...

1049
01:49:08,650 --> 01:49:12,480
...you manipulated us all this time, huh.

1050
01:49:14,690 --> 01:49:17,470
What are you complaining about?

1051
01:49:17,720 --> 01:49:21,340
You were influenced by
greed too, weren't you!

1052
01:49:24,430 --> 01:49:27,270
In the end, you and we are
the same after all.

1053
01:49:27,560 --> 01:49:29,970
We're incapable of living
in the outside world.

1054
01:49:30,130 --> 01:49:32,530
Since we're a Tribe of Savage Beasts!

1055
01:49:34,210 --> 01:49:36,440
Fine, you got me right there...

1056
01:49:36,700 --> 01:49:40,440
What you said is true... But...

1057
01:49:40,990 --> 01:49:43,410
Somehow, what I don't get...

1058
01:49:43,710 --> 01:49:47,720
...is why I'm so fucking pissed off right now!

1059
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:52,170
Do you intend to make an enemy out
of the entire country of Iga!?

1060
01:49:52,170 --> 01:49:55,770
If I hadn't thought about it,
would I be FUCKING DOING THIS!?

1061
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:02,240
Listen, all of you!

1062
01:50:02,760 --> 01:50:05,090
The one who gets to kill Mumon...

1063
01:50:05,090 --> 01:50:07,410
...will be exempted from
paying land tax for the rest of his life!

1064
01:50:07,410 --> 01:50:12,450
This is the consensus of the
Council of 12 Houses!

1065
01:50:35,350 --> 01:50:38,120
A Tribe of Savage Beasts, huh.

1066
01:50:38,680 --> 01:50:40,410
Step away from him!

1067
01:50:49,820 --> 01:50:51,830
Is that...

1068
01:50:52,200 --> 01:50:53,980
...the Little Aubergine?

1069
01:50:54,340 --> 01:50:55,740
Don't...

1070
01:51:01,140 --> 01:51:04,760
If you lay even one finger on Mumon-dono...

1071
01:51:05,460 --> 01:51:09,650
I will smash this into
tiny pieces at once!

1072
01:51:09,900 --> 01:51:11,740
Now do as I say!

1073
01:51:20,570 --> 01:51:23,060
No... everyone...

1074
01:51:23,410 --> 01:51:25,850
Don't do it!

1075
01:52:03,550 --> 01:52:05,430
Is there more?

1076
01:52:06,340 --> 01:52:08,500
Is there more!?

1077
01:52:17,600 --> 01:52:19,750
I will save you...

1078
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:22,990
I promise I'll save you!

1079
01:52:29,370 --> 01:52:32,280
- Mumon-dono...
- Don't speak!

1080
01:52:35,820 --> 01:52:37,070
Your name...

1081
01:52:41,280 --> 01:52:43,430
Tell me...

1082
01:52:44,530 --> 01:52:46,430
...your real name.

1083
01:53:02,180 --> 01:53:04,460
I don't know.

1084
01:53:13,600 --> 01:53:15,770
When I was very young...

1085
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:25,880
I was bought and came to Iga.

1086
01:53:41,060 --> 01:53:43,670
I didn't know what my name was.

1087
01:53:46,500 --> 01:53:49,930
I don't have...

1088
01:53:51,100 --> 01:53:53,370
...such a thing as a given name.

1089
01:54:05,380 --> 01:54:07,720
You poor thing.

1090
01:54:13,340 --> 01:54:15,670
You poor poor thing...

1091
01:54:46,160 --> 01:54:47,880
Of course, she's dead.

1092
01:54:48,080 --> 01:54:53,030
She's not like you who trained
to drank in poison, right?

1093
01:54:55,240 --> 01:54:57,150
That's a dirty move, Dengo!

1094
01:55:08,540 --> 01:55:10,310
I am...

1095
01:55:11,770 --> 01:55:14,860
...such a fool.

1096
01:55:44,640 --> 01:55:46,930
You people...

1097
01:55:48,020 --> 01:55:50,530
...are not human.

1098
01:56:22,030 --> 01:56:24,420
(Two Years Later)

1099
01:56:27,570 --> 01:56:32,000
<i>After winning against the Oda Clan,
Iga's military fame astonished the world.</i>

1100
01:56:33,400 --> 01:56:36,210
Once, we wondered what we should do...

1101
01:56:36,210 --> 01:56:39,260
...to increase the hirings of our genin, right?

1102
01:56:39,260 --> 01:56:41,080
Not only did it increase...

1103
01:56:41,080 --> 01:56:43,550
They're in great demand.

1104
01:56:43,550 --> 01:56:48,070
Iga will be rich from now on!

1105
01:57:07,210 --> 01:57:11,300
<i>Oda Nobunaga along with his
son Nobukatsu as supreme commander...</i>

1106
01:57:11,300 --> 01:57:17,980
<i>...invaded Iga with approximately 44,000 soldiers,
five times more than the previous number.</i>

1107
01:57:21,410 --> 01:57:24,890
<i>Most of the people of Iga were annihilated.</i>

1108
01:57:25,330 --> 01:57:28,940
<i>The country was turned into
a land of scorched earth.</i>

1109
01:57:37,650 --> 01:57:40,340
They're already gone huh?
The shinobi of this country.

1110
01:57:41,550 --> 01:57:42,880
No.

1111
01:57:43,390 --> 01:57:45,110
I think not.

1112
01:57:45,700 --> 01:57:49,110
You can't fully erase that kind
of people from this world.

1113
01:57:51,080 --> 01:57:53,220
The Tribe of Savage Beasts...

1114
01:57:53,570 --> 01:57:56,090
...are scattered all throughout the lands.

1115
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,090
Scattered all throughout?

1116
01:58:00,860 --> 01:58:03,400
The blood of the Tribe of Savage Beasts...

1117
01:58:03,930 --> 01:58:06,330
...will completely seep through
the entire country.

1118
01:58:07,010 --> 01:58:10,340
From our children, and then to our grandchildren...

1119
01:58:10,340 --> 01:58:12,830
...and to their children's children
and so forth.

1120
01:58:12,830 --> 01:58:17,140
There will be shinobi
in their blood for sure.

1121
01:58:19,360 --> 01:58:21,990
The blood of those inhuman people...

1122
01:58:22,290 --> 01:58:27,220
...who live only for their desires,
and care not for the feelings of others...

1123
01:58:27,730 --> 01:58:33,660
...will be flowing through every
corner of the whole world.

1124
01:58:38,800 --> 01:58:42,240
So no one was able to find Mumon?

1125
01:58:42,240 --> 01:58:44,290
No.

1126
01:58:44,290 --> 01:58:48,640
Nobukatsu-sama ordered us not
to leave any stone unturned...

1127
01:58:48,640 --> 01:58:51,400
...but we couldn't find his head at all.

1128
01:58:51,400 --> 01:58:53,860
But according to a captured person from Iga...

1129
01:58:53,860 --> 01:58:57,650
...he was certain he saw Mumon
during the war here.

1130
01:58:57,870 --> 01:59:00,420
What I heard was...

1131
01:59:00,420 --> 01:59:03,100
...he came to look for a kid.

1132
01:59:03,100 --> 01:59:05,220
A kid? Was it Mumon's child?

1133
01:59:05,220 --> 01:59:06,660
No, no, no...

1134
01:59:06,730 --> 01:59:10,470
It was some orphan kid...
Not adorable at all.

1135
01:59:12,020 --> 01:59:14,580
He wasn't human...

1136
01:59:15,040 --> 01:59:17,650
...but he wanted to be one, huh.

1137
01:59:20,800 --> 01:59:22,260
If that's true...

1138
01:59:22,410 --> 01:59:24,280
...how much will you give me?

1139
02:00:09,650 --> 02:00:14,170
<i>From then on, I was raised by my father.</i>

1140
02:00:20,280 --> 02:00:23,900
<i>I don't remember my mother's face much...</i>

1141
02:00:23,900 --> 02:00:27,220
<i>But Father said she was very beautiful...</i>

1142
02:00:27,220 --> 02:00:29,920
<i>...and an extremely...</i>

1143
02:00:29,920 --> 02:00:32,230
<i>...scary person.</i>

1144
02:00:43,460 --> 02:00:47,440
誰だって そう 探してる Everyday
Dare datte sou sagashiteru Everyday
Everybody is looking for it Everyday

1145

Samayoi aruite Shiawase no basho made
Wandering and walking, Til they reach a place of happiness

Why? Nani ka okiru sain
Why? Is there some kind of waking sign

1147

You're almost shaking, Pretending to be tough and free

1149

Shinpainara iranai yo Mamori nukukara
No need to worry, For I'll protect you until the end

1150
02:01:11,950 --> 02:01:14,160
何があっても

No matter what happens

どんな暗い夜でも あなただけを
