Shit!

Merlin, I'm entering Hyde Park.

4
0:0:51.130 --> 0:0:52.999
Can I get on with it?

0:0:56.335 --> 0:0:57.469
Merlin!

MERLIN: No time to relax.
Police are right behind you.

You have 30 seconds before
they reach your position.

0:1:21.594 --> 0:1:23.796
Go directly to Rendezvous Swan.

Merlin, you do realize
I haven't even got a windscreen right now?

13
0:1:37.142 --> 0:1:38.577
I seem to remember
from your training

14
0:1:38.611 --> 0:1:40.313
you were rather good
at holding your breath.
