0:0:8.305 --> 0:0:11.309
GINGER: We've dealt with
this kind of amnesia before.

2
0:0:11.342 --> 0:0:14.979
Harry's like a computer
that needs to be rebooted.

3
0:0:16.280 --> 0:0:20.084
We need to recreate a shock
or trauma from his past...

4
0:0:20.117 --> 0:0:21.485
to trigger his memory.

5
0:0:23.019 --> 0:0:24.354
MERLIN: I hope you're right.

6
0:0:28.791 --> 0:0:30.160
(GASPS)

7
0:0:33.963 --> 0:0:35.332
Uh, excuse me.

8
0:0:35.365 --> 0:0:38.068
There seems to be
some sort of a problem here.

9
0:0:38.101 --> 0:0:40.738
Help! Somebody!

10
0:0:40.771 --> 0:0:44.075
What the hell is
going on? Help me!

11
0:0:46.910 --> 0:0:48.145
Help!

12
0:0:49.845 --> 0:0:50.981
Oh, God!

13
0:0:51.014 --> 0:0:53.284
Stop! Fuck!

14
0:1:14.505 --> 0:1:15.606
Get him out now.

15
0:1:15.639 --> 0:1:17.575
No, no, wait. His instincts
are gonna kick in.

16
0:1:21.110 --> 0:1:22.712
(MUFFLED YELLING)

17
0:1:29.787 --> 0:1:31.389
No. I'm sorry to do this.

18
0:1:41.465 --> 0:1:43.267
(COUGHING)

19
0:1:46.503 --> 0:1:47.738
(GASPING)

20
0:1:52.342 --> 0:1:54.577
Are you okay?
What happened?

21
0:1:54.610 --> 0:1:57.179
Harry, you've forgotten
who you are.

22
0:1:57.213 --> 0:2:0.616
We thought this might
jog your memory.

23
0:2:0.651 --> 0:2:3.720
Look, when you were young,
you had a choice.

24
0:2:3.753 --> 0:2:6.489
To either be a lepidopterist
or to join the army.

25
0:2:6.523 --> 0:2:9.325
You chose the army.
That led to Kingsman.

26
0:2:9.358 --> 0:2:12.328
You became a Kingsman agent.

27
0:2:12.363 --> 0:2:13.797
I doubt whether
I'd work for anyone

28
0:2:13.831 --> 0:2:14.832
who drowns their employees.

29
0:2:15.898 --> 0:2:17.200
I want to go home.

30
0:2:17.233 --> 0:2:18.835
I want my butterfly collection.

31
0:2:20.137 --> 0:2:21.671
I want to see Mother.

32
0:2:23.206 --> 0:2:25.342
GINGER: There's nothing more
we can do.

33
0:2:26.742 --> 0:2:28.311
It's time to let him go.

34
0:2:38.021 --> 0:2:39.490
EGGSY: Babe, I wish
I could stay longer,

35
0:2:39.523 --> 0:2:41.158
but I've got to go on
with this mission.

36
0:2:41.191 --> 0:2:44.294
Wait, wait, wait.

37
0:2:44.327 --> 0:2:46.831
Before you go,
I wanna show you something.

38
0:2:49.099 --> 0:2:50.167
EGGSY: Aw!

39
0:2:50.200 --> 0:2:52.736
I know he could
never replace JB...

40
0:2:52.769 --> 0:2:54.171
but...

41
0:2:56.139 --> 0:2:58.307
Oh, my days.

42
0:2:58.342 --> 0:3:0.577
I hoped he might make you happy.
