Galahad in the taxi

Unfortunately, Galahad,
you also saved Charlie.

254
00:19:50,342 --> 00:19:53,312
When you electrocuted him,
you damaged his implant.

Instead of his head exploding...

256
00:19:54,912 --> 00:19:57,382
he only lost an arm
and his vocal chords.

when pirates wanted to test
the strength of their rum.

548
00:37:24,095 --> 00:37:26,497

on gunpowder.

And if the gunpowder,

552
00:37:34,805 --> 00:37:36,441
if it burnt when
they set it alight...

553
00:37:36,474 --> 00:37:38,176
they considered it proof...

554
00:37:38,209 --> 00:37:40,412
that their rum
was good and strong.

555
00:37:42,345 --> 00:37:44,882

no gunpowder on me, do I?

you boys'll make

your cheap horse piss

565
00:38:05,202 --> 00:38:06,371
that you call whiskey...

566
00:38:06,403 --> 00:38:07,938
which, by the way,
is spelled without an "e"...

567
00:38:07,972 --> 00:38:10,408

to a single malt scotch...

568

have you done to him?

Nothing. Only tried
to help him.

He's got retrograde amnesia.

that he was intelligence.

01:17:59,828 --> 01:18:01,797
No, what I'm proposing...

1272
01:18:01,829 --> 01:18:04,698
is we appear
to agree to her demands

1273
01:18:04,733 --> 01:18:06,135
to prevent global panic...

1274
01:18:06,167 --> 01:18:11,538

go down in flames. Huh?

Huh? Yeah.

1277

Golden Circle down with them.

It's a win-win situation here.

1279
01:18:24,319 --> 01:18:27,688
But, sir, we're not talking about
a handful of hostages.

1280
01:18:27,721 --> 01:18:29,190
We could be looking
at the deaths

1281
01:18:29,224 --> 01:18:31,060

of millions worldwide.

Absolutely, sir.

But, sir, that's...

1287
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:41,837
What about people who were
just experimenting?

1288
01:18:41,869 --> 01:18:43,805

1291
01:18:48,542 --> 01:18:49,944
(CHUCKLES) The fact is,

1292
01:18:49,977 --> 01:18:53,015

won the war on drugs.

01:18:53,047 --> 01:18:54,282

Thank you.

1295
01:18:58,753 --> 01:19:01,856

totally unethical, sir.

PRESIDENT: Fox, shut up!

1298
01:19:06,927 --> 01:19:09,064
McCoy, declare martial law.

1299
01:19:09,097 --> 01:19:11,800
We need to keep control,
commandeer stadiums,

1300
01:19:11,833 --> 01:19:13,735
schools, civic centers...

1301
01:19:13,769 --> 01:19:15,169
order a press blackout.

1302
01:19:15,203 --> 01:19:17,039
And put the military on standby

1303
01:19:17,072 --> 01:19:19,108
to round these junkies up.

1304
01:19:20,042 --> 01:19:21,810
Whether they broke
the law or not,

1305
01:19:21,843 --> 01:19:24,113
those victims are human beings.

He's a great guy.

1308
01:19:31,519 --> 01:19:33,387
And a great agent.

1309
01:19:33,421 --> 01:19:37,191
Right now, he's lying in deep
freeze waitin' on our help.

1310
01:19:37,225 --> 01:19:39,627
We can't make
this personal, sir.

1311
01:19:39,660 --> 01:19:40,929
Personal?

1312
01:19:40,962 --> 01:19:43,865
Agent, we can't stand by
and let folks like him die.

1313
01:19:43,898 --> 01:19:46,435
These people,
we're their only hope.

1314
01:19:48,203 --> 01:19:50,039
Now, we have
to find that antidote.

1315
01:19:50,072 --> 01:19:52,675
Poppy's stockpiles, well,
they could be anywhere.

She must have some on hand.

1317
01:19:54,676 --> 01:19:56,245
Locate Poppy...

1318
01:19:57,378 --> 01:20:00,114
and obtain a sample
for analysis.

1319
01:20:00,148 --> 01:20:02,016
Maybe it can be replicated.

Why didn't you tell me?

1326
01:20:12,961 --> 01:20:15,530
All you said was,
"Don't take any drugs."

1327
01:20:15,564 --> 01:20:17,966
It was a music festival
for fuck's sake.

to the lab in Italy.

where we went skiing?

Yes. Yes, I remember.

out there in time?
