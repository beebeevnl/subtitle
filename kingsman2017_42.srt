1
0:0:1.261 --> 0:0:5.231
Why not? The decree's getting
signed soon... (SNIFFS)

2
0:0:5.265 --> 0:0:6.932
anyhoo. Um...

3
0:0:7.565 --> 0:0:9.935
It's "Viva las vegan."

4
0:0:11.037 --> 0:0:12.137
Get it?

5
0:0:12.806 --> 0:0:15.274
"Viva las..."

6
0:0:15.307 --> 0:0:16.676
Mmm.

7
0:0:17.676 --> 0:0:19.746
(SLURRING)
Come snuggle with me.

8
0:0:20.546 --> 0:0:22.615
I like you.

9
0:0:24.617 --> 0:0:26.820
(DISTORTED) I don't think
that's terribly likely.

10
0:0:27.419 --> 0:0:29.922
(LAUGHING)

11
0:0:49.141 --> 0:0:50.276
She's OD'd.

12
0:0:50.309 --> 0:0:51.778
You gave her too much.

13
0:0:51.810 --> 0:0:53.345
Did I?

14
0:0:53.378 --> 0:0:55.981
You know, I really don't have
as much experience with all this drug stuff...

15
0:0:56.015 --> 0:0:57.016
as people think.

16
0:0:57.682 --> 0:0:59.017
Better be the right code.

17
0:1:1.453 --> 0:1:2.822
(SIGHS)

18
0:1:2.855 --> 0:1:6.324
"Viva las..."

19
0:1:6.359 --> 0:1:7.660
So?

20
0:1:11.230 --> 0:1:12.565
Don't move, kid.

21
0:1:12.597 --> 0:1:13.800
You try anything funny,

22
0:1:13.833 --> 0:1:15.034
and I'll turn
this thing electric.

23
0:1:16.635 --> 0:1:19.271
Now give up your guns,
fellas. Slide 'em over.

24
0:1:24.976 --> 0:1:25.877
Whiskey.

25
0:1:25.912 --> 0:1:27.780
We are all
on the same side here.

26
0:1:27.814 --> 0:1:28.914
You've had a head injury.

27
0:1:28.948 --> 0:1:30.716
The exact same thing
happened to Harry.

28
0:1:30.749 --> 0:1:33.218
You're havin'
some sort of brain glitch.

29
0:1:33.252 --> 0:1:36.122
Nope. My brain's
all good, kid.

30
0:1:36.654 --> 0:1:38.090
And you know what?

31
0:1:38.123 --> 0:1:41.894
I reckon the same was true for your friend
Harry over here.

32
0:1:41.926 --> 0:1:44.929
Real fine instincts,
I'll give him that.

33
0:1:44.963 --> 0:1:46.364
So stay still...

34
0:1:46.398 --> 0:1:47.499
or I'll dice him up so small,

35
0:1:47.533 --> 0:1:48.633
you can take him
home in a bucket...

36
0:1:48.667 --> 0:1:50.035
and still have room
for what's left

37
0:1:50.069 --> 0:1:51.604
of your buddy, Merlin.

38
0:1:52.639 --> 0:1:54.306
Well, that's just fucking great.

39
0:1:54.340 --> 0:1:55.908
You're working
for the president?

40
0:1:55.941 --> 0:1:57.176
That asshole?

41
0:1:57.209 --> 0:1:58.276
(CHUCKLES)

42
0:1:58.310 --> 0:2:2.448
Hell no. It's a matter
of personal principle, agent.

43
0:2:2.480 --> 0:2:4.983
No more drug users.

44
0:2:5.016 --> 0:2:8.086
And the Statesman
share price rockets.

45
0:2:9.555 --> 0:2:12.858
So those are your principles?
Making money?

46
0:2:12.891 --> 0:2:15.194
Our agencies were
founded to uphold peace.

47
0:2:15.226 --> 0:2:16.429
To protect the innocent.

48
0:2:16.462 --> 0:2:18.530
Do you wanna know
who was innocent?

49
0:2:18.564 --> 0:2:21.568
My high school sweetheart.

50
0:2:22.034 --> 0:2:23.869
Love of my life.

51
0:2:23.903 --> 0:2:25.805
Pregnant with my little boy.

52
0:2:26.704 --> 0:2:28.675
He'd be about your age now...

53
0:2:28.708 --> 0:2:30.676
if his mama hadn't got caught
in the crossfire...

54
0:2:30.709 --> 0:2:31.810
when two meth head freaks

55
0:2:31.843 --> 0:2:34.881
decided to rob
a fucking convenience store.

56
0:2:37.417 --> 0:2:40.586
A world without
those people in it...

57
0:2:40.618 --> 0:2:43.088
sure smells like peace to me.

58
0:2:43.855 --> 0:2:46.024
You break the law...

59
0:2:46.059 --> 0:2:47.927
you pay the price.

60
0:2:48.593 --> 0:2:50.628
Good riddance...

61
0:2:50.662 --> 0:2:52.932
to all of them.

62
0:2:57.669 --> 0:3:0.939
That's why I got
to destroy that case.
