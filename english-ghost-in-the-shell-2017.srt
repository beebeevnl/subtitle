139
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,380
<font color=#FFFF80>The first two were shot...</font>

140
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:38,220
<font color=#FFFF80>and the third was beaten to death
by his own service robot.</font>

141
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,310
<font color=#FFFF80>All showed signs of cerebral hacking.</font>

142
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:45,100
<font color=#FFFF80>The same as the geisha did to Osmond.</font>

143
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:49,620
<font color=#FFFF80>And all were senior figures... in Hanka.</font>

144
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,300
<font color=#FFFF80>Just like Osmond.</font>

145
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,673
<font color=#FFFF80>A message was left
at each of the crime scene...</font>

146
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,070

- I don't remember much.</font>

<font color=#FFFF80>What about family?</font>

192
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,210
<font color=#FFFF80>My parents, they died
bringing us to this country.</font>

<font color=#FFFF80>Are you okay?</font>

- That's unfair.</font>

286

for a nightclub.</font>

291

<font color=#FFFF80>It's a Yakuza club. What did you expect?</font>

292

See if I can access the basement that way.</font>

looking for any trouble, are you?</font>

296
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:29,940

<font color=#FFFF80>You've been here before?</font>

299

<font color=#FFFF80>My friend had some mech work done here.
Industry stuff.</font>

300
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:41,890

301
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:43,950
<font color=#FFFF80>My mistake.</font>

We will have some privacy.</font>

304
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,300
<font color=#FFFF80>I'll be here when you need me.</font>

305
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:15,980

- I said my friend had work done here.</font>

307
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,470
<font color=#FFFF80>Your friend.</font>

308
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,020
<font color=#FFFF80>Now what's that supposed to mean?</font>

309

312
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,880
<font color=#FFFF80>It is divine.</font>

315
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:47,050
<font color=#FFFF80>Batou, I'm losing signal.</font>

316
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:49,350
<font color=#FFFF80>Don't worry sweety.</font>

317
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,830
<font color=#FFFF80>We have privacy.</font>

318
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,640
<font color=#FFFF80>Listen.</font>

319
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,400
<font color=#FFFF80>No signal is going in or out.</font>

320

<font color=#FFFF80>Major, I'm in position. Do you copy?</font>

<font color=#FFFF80>Beer.</font>

<font color=#FFFF80>If you don't answer,
you're gonna hurt my feelings.</font>

323
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:17,640
<font color=#FFFF80>Ladriya, do you have major on Comms?</font>

324
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,440
<font color=#FFFF80>Got nothing. The signal is still blocked.</font>

325
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,670
<font color=#FFFF80>I am afraid I get bored
rather easily, so...</font>

326
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,940
<font color=#FFFF80>You don't wanna talk...</font>

327
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,900
<font color=#FFFF80>Maybe you wanna dance!</font>

328
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,340
<font color=#FFFF80>Major, come on. Answer me.</font>

329
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:52,250
<font color=#FFFF80>I thought you said no trouble.</font>

330
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,350
<font color=#FFFF80>Dance!</font>

331
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:02,200
<font color=#FFFF80>The truth is...</font>

332
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:05,490
<font color=#FFFF80>I wasn't built to dance.</font>

333
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:02,420
<font color=#FFFF80>Back on comms.
I am heading to the back room.</font>

334
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,390
<font color=#FFFF80>I missed you. I'll meet you there.</font>

337
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,390
<font color=#FFFF80>Where is Batou?</font>

338
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:31,210
<font color=#FFFF80>In enhancement, next door.
He is doing well</font>

339
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:35,270
<font color=#FFFF80>you took most of the blast.</font>

340
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,150
<font color=#FFFF80>I saw him down there.</font>

341
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:43,320
<font color=#FFFF80>It was like...</font>

342
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,880
<font color=#FFFF80>He waited to see me.</font>

343
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,520
<font color=#FFFF80>We synaptic scanned you.</font>

344
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:53,160
<font color=#FFFF80>Everything you witnessed
went to Section 9 to evaluate.</font>

346
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,320

00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,050
<font color=#FFFF80>They've been getting worse.</font>

348
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,180
<font color=#FFFF80>Since when?</font>

349
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,770
<font color=#FFFF80>Since the deep dive.</font>

350
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:28,030
<font color=#FFFF80>Do any of the glitches
mean something to you?</font>

351
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:30,550
<font color=#FFFF80>No.</font>

353

<font color=#FFFF80>You have been inside
the same shell as he has.</font>

354
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:42,270
<font color=#FFFF80>That could have very serious consequences.</font>

355
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:46,430
<font color=#FFFF80>You were not authorized
to deep dive the geisha.</font>

356
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,290
<font color=#FFFF80>You're disappointed.</font>

357
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:52,520
<font color=#FFFF80>No, I'm worried.</font>

372

00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:09,660
<font color=#FFFF80>Tell me what they took from me.</font>

412
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:14,760
<font color=#FFFF80>I am sorry. They never told us.</font>

00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:39,750
<font color=#FFFF80>It feels weird driving with these eyes.</font>

<font color=#FFFF80>Why do you take that?</font>

alright I told you.</font>

455

- Yeah.</font>

- Right.</font>

<font color=#FFFF80>Do you have that?</font>

461

463
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,460
<font color=#FFFF80>I think it's a tall place.
Is it a tall building?</font>

464
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:13,560
<font color=#FFFF80>It's a tall place, right?</font>

465
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:16,470
<font color=#FFFF80>You don't have a child.</font>

<font color=#FFFF80>You have no wife. You live alone,
It's just you.</font>

467
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:24,400
<font color=#FFFF80>- What? No.
- We went to your apartment.</font>

468
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:25,830
<font color=#FFFF80>- There was nobody there.
- No.</font>

<font color=#FFFF80>You live there for
10 years by yourself.</font>

<font color=#FFFF80>No.</font>

471
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,120
<font color=#FFFF80>- You're just lying.
- I'm not lying.</font>

472
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:32,790
<font color=#FFFF80>I didn't kill anyone!</font>

473
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:35,310
<font color=#FFFF80>- Why do you keep doing this to me?
- Holocube disconnect.</font>

474
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:36,740
<font color=#FFFF80>Please!</font>

475
00:49:37,490 --> 00:49:39,450
<font color=#FFFF80>I didn't do anything.</font>

476
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:42,297
<font color=#FFFF80>Why do you keep saying this to me?</font>

477
00:49:42,497 --> 00:49:44,340
<font color=#FFFF80>I don't understand.
How can he not know?</font>

478
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:48,420
<font color=#FFFF80>The hack must have created a vacuum.
Kuze's wiped his memory...</font>

479
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:51,350
<font color=#FFFF80>and somehow installed a new reality.</font>

480
00:49:53,310 --> 00:49:55,140
<font color=#FFFF80>At least he got to believe he had a kid.</font>

481
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:57,910
<font color=#FFFF80>What's the difference huh?</font>

482
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,410
<font color=#FFFF80>Fantasy, reality?</font>

483
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:03,590
<font color=#FFFF80>Dreams, memories?</font>

484
00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:06,220
<font color=#FFFF80>It's all the same.</font>

485
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:08,580
<font color=#FFFF80>Just noise.</font>

486
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:11,580
<font color=#FFFF80>It's him.</font>

487
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:16,110
<font color=#FFFF80>He is in there.</font>

488
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:21,340
<font color=#FFFF80>This cube is secure.
He can't be, Major.</font>

<font color=#FFFF80>Lie Detector.</font>

490
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,279
<font color=#FFFF80>He must have hacked in that way.</font>

491
00:50:24,437 --> 00:50:27,289
<font color=#FFFF80>We should uplink to the machine,
trace the code, get a lock on his location.</font>

492
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:28,660
<font color=#FFFF80>Do it.</font>

493
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:31,130
<font color=#FFFF80>Don't go in there.
It's too dangerous.</font>

494
00:50:31,690 --> 00:50:33,260
<font color=#FFFF80><i>Major</i></font>

495

496
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,490
<font color=#FFFF80>The signal is unstable.
Can you get the lock on him?</font>

497
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:52,860
<font color=#FFFF80>We gotta move fast. We're losing him.</font>

498
00:50:52,990 --> 00:50:54,280
<font color=#FFFF80>Connecting.</font>

499

503
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:11,080
<font color=#FFFF80>like you.</font>

504
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:16,080
<font color=#FFFF80>Tell me who you are.</font>

505
00:51:16,390 --> 00:51:19,300
<font color=#FFFF80>I have been born more than once.</font>

506
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:22,570
<font color=#FFFF80>So I have more than one name</font>

507
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:24,620
<font color=#FFFF80>I'll find you.</font>

508
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:26,560
<font color=#FFFF80>Not yet.</font>

509
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,740
<font color=#FFFF80>I am not done.</font>

510
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,120
<font color=#FFFF80>The machine is tracing his location.</font>

511
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:32,700
<font color=#FFFF80>We got a fix!</font>

512
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:40,000
<font color=#FFFF80>I need to see her.</font>

513

<font color=#FFFF80>Weapons up.</font>

517
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:12,740

- On me.</font>

518
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:02,650

<font color=#FFFF80>Come in.</font>

523
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:25,930
<font color=#FFFF80>I know why we could not find him.</font>

524
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:32,010
<font color=#FFFF80>He is using human minds
to create a network of his own.</font>

525
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:33,650
<font color=#FFFF80>We're coming to your position.</font>

526
00:55:48,890 --> 00:55:50,720
<font color=#FFFF80>Tell me who you are.</font>

531
00:56:13,590 --> 00:56:18,500

to a network of my own creation.</font>

532
00:56:18,950 --> 00:56:21,180
<font color=#FFFF80>When I am finished in this world...</font>

<font color=#FFFF80>my ghost can survive
there and regenerate.</font>

<font color=#FFFF80>What do you want from me?</font>

535
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:31,110
<font color=#FFFF80>I became...</font>

538
00:56:38,030 --> 00:56:40,570

539
00:56:43,110 --> 00:56:46,750
<font color=#FFFF80>Like nothing I had felt before,
yet so..</font>

541
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:53,320

542
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:55,440
<font color=#FFFF80>We are not the same.</font>

543
00:56:58,150 --> 00:57:00,080
<font color=#FFFF80>You kill innocent people.</font>

544
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:03,200
<font color=#FFFF80>Innocent? Is that the..what you call them?</font>

545
00:57:04,050 --> 00:57:06,350
<font color=#FFFF80>I am as they need me.</font>

546
00:57:07,630 --> 00:57:08,910
<font color=#FFFF80>Who made you?</font>

547
00:57:09,230 --> 00:57:11,120
<font color=#FFFF80>What have they told you?</font>

548
00:57:11,630 --> 00:57:13,750
<font color=#FFFF80>That you were the first?</font>

549
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:16,680
<font color=#FFFF80>The first cerebral salvage.</font>

550
00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:21,300
<font color=#FFFF80>You were born of lessons...
they took.</font>

551
00:57:21,710 --> 00:57:23,190
<font color=#FFFF80>from my failure.</font>

552
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:26,860
<font color=#FFFF80>What are you talking about?</font>

553
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:33,250
<font color=#FFFF80>I was conscious while they
dismembered my body, and discarded me</font>

554
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:35,520
<font color=#FFFF80>like garbage.</font>

555
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:39,170
<font color=#FFFF80>I was lying on a table...</font>

556
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:44,410
<font color=#FFFF80>Listening to doctors talk about how
my mind had not meshed with the shell.</font>

557
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:46,760
<font color=#FFFF80>That they had built.</font>

558
00:57:47,790 --> 00:57:51,070
<font color=#FFFF80>how project t-two, five, seven, one..</font>

559
00:57:51,570 --> 00:57:52,860
<font color=#FFFF80>had failed...</font>

560
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:55,540
<font color=#FFFF80>and they had to move on...</font>

561
00:58:01,850 --> 00:58:03,030
<font color=#FFFF80>to you.</font>

562
00:58:10,310 --> 00:58:12,650
<font color=#FFFF80>What a beauty you are.</font>

563
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:18,220
<font color=#FFFF80>They have improved us so much...</font>

564
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:20,350
<font color=#FFFF80>since they made me.</font>

565
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:27,670
<font color=#FFFF80>They thought that we would be
a part of their evolution.</font>

566
00:58:27,810 --> 00:58:30,350
<font color=#FFFF80>But they have created us...</font>

567
00:58:30,650 --> 00:58:33,050
<font color=#FFFF80>to evolve alone...</font>

568
00:58:37,950 --> 00:58:39,310
<font color=#FFFF80>beyond them.</font>

569
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:42,290
<font color=#FFFF80>Evolution? That's what you call?</font>

570
00:58:43,050 --> 00:58:45,040
<font color=#FFFF80>Killing everyone who made you?</font>

571
00:58:45,490 --> 00:58:47,750
<font color=#FFFF80>You are not listening to me.</font>

572
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:49,850
<font color=#FFFF80>You are murderer.</font>

573
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:53,150
<font color=#FFFF80>They tried to kill me first.</font>

574
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:56,910
<font color=#FFFF80>It is self-defense.</font>

575
00:58:57,230 --> 00:58:59,090
<font color=#FFFF80>The defense of self.</font>

576
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:03,500
<font color=#FFFF80>More will die...</font>

577
00:59:05,910 --> 00:59:07,550
<font color=#FFFF80>until they tell me...</font>

578
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:09,560
<font color=#FFFF80>what they took.</font>

579
00:59:09,810 --> 00:59:11,150
<font color=#FFFF80>I won't let that happen.</font>

580
00:59:13,490 --> 00:59:15,030
<font color=#FFFF80>You want to kill me?</font>

581
00:59:19,550 --> 00:59:21,500
<font color=#FFFF80>Like everyone else.</font>

582
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:29,490
<font color=#FFFF80>Do it, then.</font>

583
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:34,950
<font color=#FFFF80>Do what you were programmed to do.</font>

584
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:48,130
<font color=#FFFF80>What is that?</font>

585
01:00:00,270 --> 01:00:01,840
<font color=#FFFF80>What is that?</font>

586
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:07,330
<font color=#FFFF80>I c-c-can't remember,
but I am haunted by it.</font>

587
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:10,130
<font color=#FFFF80>Do You see it?</font>

588
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:16,710
<font color=#FFFF80>Togusa!</font>

589
01:00:21,730 --> 01:00:25,910
<font color=#FFFF80>Don't take the medication
that they gave you..</font>

590
01:00:26,550 --> 01:00:29,300
<font color=#FFFF80>They use it to suppress your memories.</font>

591
01:00:29,890 --> 01:00:33,600
<font color=#FFFF80>Your shell belongs to them,
but not your ghost.</font>

592
01:00:34,350 --> 01:00:36,050
<font color=#FFFF80>Your ghost is yours.</font>

593
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:38,100
<font color=#FFFF80>Remember that...</font>

594
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:41,290
<font color=#FFFF80>and maybe you can remember it all.</font>

595
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:52,050
<font color=#FFFF80>Get away from her!
Get down on the ground now.</font>

596
01:00:58,100 --> 01:00:59,320
<font color=#FFFF80>Major..</font>

597
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:10,080
<font color=#FFFF80>Major!</font>

598
01:02:12,090 --> 01:02:13,400
<font color=#FFFF80>How many?</font>

599
01:02:17,290 --> 01:02:18,610
<font color=#FFFF80>Dozens.</font>

600
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:25,680
<font color=#FFFF80>How many?</font>

601
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:32,000
<font color=#FFFF80>98 unsuccessful attempts before you.</font>

602
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:36,580
<font color=#FFFF80>You killed 98 innocent people.</font>

603
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:39,230
<font color=#FFFF80>No, I didn't kill anyone.</font>

604
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:41,540
<font color=#FFFF80>You wouldn't be here.</font>

605
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:44,690
<font color=#FFFF80>You would not exist if it
weren't for those experiments.</font>

606
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:46,500
<font color=#FFFF80>Experiments?</font>

607
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:50,590
<font color=#FFFF80>- Is that what I am to you?
- No!</font>

608
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:54,270
<font color=#FFFF80>No, Mira!</font>

609
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:01,630
<font color=#FFFF80>Sacrifices were made.</font>

610
01:03:04,130 --> 01:03:06,110
<font color=#FFFF80>Where did the bodies come from?</font>

611
01:03:08,530 --> 01:03:10,200
<font color=#FFFF80>Where did I come from?</font>

612
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:13,900
<font color=#FFFF80>Mr. Cutter brought them to us.</font>

613
01:03:14,330 --> 01:03:16,160
<font color=#FFFF80>I did not ask questions.</font>

614
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:17,750
<font color=#FFFF80>The harbor.</font>

615
01:03:18,570 --> 01:03:20,070
<font color=#FFFF80>My parents.</font>

616
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:22,420
<font color=#FFFF80>The way they died.</font>

617
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:25,810
<font color=#FFFF80>Did that happen?</font>

618
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:30,120
<font color=#FFFF80>No.</font>

619
01:03:33,260 --> 01:03:35,680
<font color=#FFFF80>We gave you false memories.</font>

620
01:03:36,950 --> 01:03:38,700
<font color=#FFFF80>Cutter wanted to motivate you.</font>

621
01:03:39,270 --> 01:03:41,550
<font color=#FFFF80>To fight terrorists.
I didn't approve.</font>

622
01:03:41,890 --> 01:03:45,300
<font color=#FFFF80>It was cruel, but my work,
that was important, and...</font>

623
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:47,560
<font color=#FFFF80>you were born.</font>

624
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:50,830
<font color=#FFFF80>You were so beautiful.</font>

625
01:03:52,940 --> 01:03:55,110
<font color=#FFFF80>Nothing I have is real.</font>

626
01:03:58,220 --> 01:03:59,600
<font color=#FFFF80>I found him.</font>

627
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:01,980
<font color=#FFFF80>I told you to be careful.</font>

628
01:04:02,350 --> 01:04:04,960
<font color=#FFFF80>You knew who he was the whole time.</font>

629
01:04:05,270 --> 01:04:06,430
<font color=#FFFF80>You built him.</font>

630
01:04:07,970 --> 01:04:09,270
<font color=#FFFF80>He had a..</font>

631
01:04:10,230 --> 01:04:12,260
<font color=#FFFF80>Violent unstable mind.</font>

632
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:15,490
<font color=#FFFF80>His cerebral connection wouldn't hold!</font>

633
01:04:15,930 --> 01:04:18,060
<font color=#FFFF80>- I tried to save him!
- No.</font>

634
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:20,560
<font color=#FFFF80>You left him to die.</font>

635
01:04:31,610 --> 01:04:35,210
<font color=#FFFF80><i>Nothing on Kuze yet, sir.
Checking upper zones next.</i></font>

636
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:38,430
<font color=#FFFF80>Is there any word on Major?</font>

637
01:04:39,310 --> 01:04:43,030
<font color=#FFFF80><i>She's gone.
Off-grid. Silent.</i></font>

638
01:04:44,330 --> 01:04:46,070
<font color=#FFFF80>Copy that, sir.</font>

639
01:04:46,490 --> 01:04:48,400
<font color=#FFFF80>I know where to find her.</font>

640
01:05:32,270 --> 01:05:34,160
<font color=#FFFF80>I didn't ask you to come here.</font>

641
01:05:35,310 --> 01:05:36,820
<font color=#FFFF80>You never ask.</font>

642
01:05:37,550 --> 01:05:39,130
<font color=#FFFF80>But I always do.</font>

643
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:45,450
<font color=#FFFF80>Did they send you to bring me in?</font>

644
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:49,910
<font color=#FFFF80>I'm just here to fish. Did you see any?</font>

645
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:54,720
<font color=#FFFF80>You are a company man, you follow orders.
So, if they ordered you to kill me..</font>

646
01:05:55,010 --> 01:05:57,840
<font color=#FFFF80>Stop saying shit like that.
You're gonna piss me off.</font>

647
01:06:20,630 --> 01:06:22,290
<font color=#FFFF80>What's it like down there?</font>

648
01:06:24,030 --> 01:06:25,790
<font color=#FFFF80>It's Cold and dark.</font>

649
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:29,150
<font color=#FFFF80>Just a million miles away.</font>

650
01:06:30,430 --> 01:06:31,960
<font color=#FFFF80>No voices.</font>

651
01:06:32,870 --> 01:06:34,480
<font color=#FFFF80>No data streaming.</font>

652
01:06:35,850 --> 01:06:36,850
<font color=#FFFF80>Just...</font>

653
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:41,400
<font color=#FFFF80>nothing.</font>

654
01:06:45,820 --> 01:06:48,860
<font color=#FFFF80>- It scares me.
- Then Why do you do it?</font>

655
01:06:55,850 --> 01:06:57,290
<font color=#FFFF80>It feels real.</font>

656
01:06:58,270 --> 01:07:00,160
<font color=#FFFF80>Why didn't you stop him?</font>

657
01:07:03,540 --> 01:07:05,520
<font color=#FFFF80>I don't know who to trust anymore.</font>

658
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:08,230
<font color=#FFFF80>You trust me, right?</font>

659
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:14,170
<font color=#FFFF80>Yes I do.</font>

660
01:07:17,470 --> 01:07:19,150
<font color=#FFFF80>I just don't like it.</font>

661
01:07:27,630 --> 01:07:29,490
<font color=#FFFF80>I need you to take me back.</font>

662
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,610
<font color=#FFFF80>There is more I need to find out.</font>

663
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:37,370
<font color=#FFFF80>Sure.</font>

664
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:56,890
<font color=#FFFF80>Dr. Ouelet...</font>

665
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:59,280
<font color=#FFFF80>What have you told her?</font>

666
01:08:01,730 --> 01:08:03,210
<font color=#FFFF80>She knows.</font>

667
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:05,910
<font color=#FFFF80>I'm bringing her in.</font>

668
01:08:36,650 --> 01:08:38,520
<font color=#FFFF80>Hanka security to Headquarters.</font>

669
01:08:39,630 --> 01:08:41,380
<font color=#FFFF80>We have the Major.</font>

670
01:09:18,650 --> 01:09:20,160
<font color=#FFFF80>Why is she sedated?</font>

671
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:23,140
<font color=#FFFF80>She's been turned by a terrorist.</font>

672
01:09:24,130 --> 01:09:25,840
<font color=#FFFF80>But you know that already.</font>

673
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:31,160
<font color=#FFFF80>You should have called
the first time she came to see you.</font>

674
01:09:32,650 --> 01:09:34,160
<font color=#FFFF80>Instead, you gave
her information.</font>

675
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:35,540
<font color=#FFFF80>What makes you think you have the..</font>

676
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:38,310
<font color=#FFFF80>- Right to tell me that?
- 2-5-7-1 took us close.</font>

677
01:09:39,210 --> 01:09:40,930
<font color=#FFFF80>It's time to move on to the next iteration.</font>

678
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:42,470
<font color=#FFFF80>2-5-7-1 is not a failure.</font>

679
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:44,660
<font color=#FFFF80>I will delete all the
data and reprogram her.</font>

680
01:09:44,890 --> 01:09:47,870
<font color=#FFFF80>- She won't remember him at all.
- No, no, no, no.</font>

681
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:51,280
<font color=#FFFF80>You download all the data
on the terrorist...</font>

682
01:09:51,570 --> 01:09:53,600
<font color=#FFFF80>and then I order you to terminate.</font>

683
01:09:57,700 --> 01:10:00,250
<font color=#FFFF80>- What?
- We'll build one that's better.</font>

684
01:10:01,370 --> 01:10:04,150
<font color=#FFFF80>- I'll delete everything.
- You deleted before.</font>

685
01:10:07,860 --> 01:10:09,650
<font color=#FFFF80>- She's mine.
- No.</font>

686
01:10:10,010 --> 01:10:12,160
<font color=#FFFF80>She is a contract... with me.</font>

687
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:14,060
<font color=#FFFF80>We succeeded.</font>

688
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:17,780
<font color=#FFFF80>She is more than human... and more than AI.</font>

689
01:10:18,150 --> 01:10:22,180
<font color=#FFFF80>We change her entire identity.
But her ghost survived!</font>

690
01:10:22,490 --> 01:10:24,640
<font color=#FFFF80>Her ghost is what failed us.</font>

691
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:28,700
<font color=#FFFF80>We can not control her.
She is no longer a viable asset.</font>

692
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,550
<font color=#FFFF80>You should be the one to do it.</font>

693
01:10:46,190 --> 01:10:48,130
<font color=#FFFF80>What are you doing to me?</font>

694
01:10:49,890 --> 01:10:52,280
<font color=#FFFF80>I'll run the standard synaptic.</font>

695
01:10:52,510 --> 01:10:54,680
<font color=#FFFF80>Upload your data on the raid.</font>

696
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:58,410
<font color=#FFFF80>I'll find out exactly what Kuze told you.</font>

697
01:10:59,390 --> 01:11:01,330
<font color=#FFFF80>You know what he told me.</font>

698
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:03,130
<font color=#FFFF80>The truth.</font>

699
01:11:06,830 --> 01:11:09,120
<font color=#FFFF80>You're deleting everything, aren't you?</font>

700
01:11:09,450 --> 01:11:10,450
<font color=#FFFF80>No.</font>

701
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:15,180
<font color=#FFFF80>So I don't remember...</font>

702
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:17,140
<font color=#FFFF80>You.</font>

703
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:29,080
<font color=#FFFF80>My name is Major Mira Killian...</font>

704
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:33,270
<font color=#FFFF80>And I do not consent
to the deletion of this data.</font>

705
01:11:35,110 --> 01:11:37,560
<font color=#FFFF80>I do not consent.</font>

706
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:42,030
<font color=#FFFF80>I do not consent.</font>

707
01:11:42,710 --> 01:11:45,170
<font color=#FFFF80>We never needed your consent.</font>

708
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:51,000
<font color=#FFFF80>Yours or anyones.</font>

709
01:11:55,530 --> 01:11:57,510
<font color=#FFFF80>You're killing me..</font>

710
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:00,250
<font color=#FFFF80>Right you..?</font>

711
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:20,860
<font color=#FFFF80>Mira?</font>

712
01:12:23,290 --> 01:12:24,600
<font color=#FFFF80>Do you hear me?</font>

713
01:12:28,590 --> 01:12:29,590
<font color=#FFFF80>Mira?</font>

714
01:12:32,770 --> 01:12:35,580
<font color=#FFFF80>This is your past, your real past. Take it.</font>

715
01:12:37,110 --> 01:12:38,750
<font color=#FFFF80>- Guards!
- Come on, come on!</font>

716
01:12:38,910 --> 01:12:40,210
<font color=#FFFF80>Come on, go!</font>

717
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:48,580
<font color=#FFFF80>Go!</font>

718
01:12:49,180 --> 01:12:50,180
<font color=#FFFF80>Go!</font>

723
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:16,860
<font color=#FFFF80>That's the problem with the human heart.</font>

724
01:13:58,160 --> 01:13:59,920
<font color=#FFFF80><i>I want to see her scan.</i></font>

725
01:14:00,340 --> 01:14:01,870
<font color=#FFFF80>She killed Dr. Ouelet.</font>

726
01:14:02,580 --> 01:14:05,900
<font color=#FFFF80>You are to have no further contact with her.
Hanka security will hunt her from here.</font>

727
01:14:05,980 --> 01:14:08,300
<font color=#FFFF80>- What are the orders?
- To terminate on sight.</font>

728
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:10,100
<font color=#FFFF80>You want to kill her? You built her!</font>

729
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:13,530
<font color=#FFFF80>- Have your sergeant stand down.
- The Major would never hurt Dr. Oulete.</font>

730
01:14:13,830 --> 01:14:15,480
<font color=#FFFF80>She is not the major anymore!</font>

731
01:14:15,790 --> 01:14:18,580
<font color=#FFFF80>We have a section 9 operative
under terrorist programming.</font>

732
01:14:18,890 --> 01:14:21,590
<font color=#FFFF80>This goes public your unit goes down.</font>

01:14:27,210 --> 01:14:29,230
<font color=#FFFF80>I'll take that under advice.</font>

736
01:14:33,180 --> 01:14:34,540
<font color=#FFFF80>So what now?</font>

737
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:30,400
<font color=#FFFF80>Oh, the pup pumpkin.</font>

738
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:33,170
<font color=#FFFF80>Oh, you surprised me.</font>

739
01:15:35,970 --> 01:15:37,710
<font color=#FFFF80>She likes you.</font>

740
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:40,590
<font color=#FFFF80>I was looking for...</font>

741
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:41,780
<font color=#FFFF80>No, come in.</font>

742
01:15:43,290 --> 01:15:44,630
<font color=#FFFF80>Yeah, go, come come.</font>

743
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:53,300

746
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,780
<font color=#FFFF80>My daughter died a year ago.</font>

747
01:16:12,140 --> 01:16:13,150
<font color=#FFFF80>I am Sorry.</font>

748
01:16:13,580 --> 01:16:15,370
<font color=#FFFF80>She run away.</font>

749
01:16:16,330 --> 01:16:18,110
<font color=#FFFF80>She was a difficult.</font>

750
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,440
<font color=#FFFF80>We fought.</font>

751
01:16:24,180 --> 01:16:27,760
<font color=#FFFF80>But I guess we all fight
with our parents, right?</font>

752
01:16:29,260 --> 01:16:30,690
<font color=#FFFF80>Please come on the sit.</font>

753
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:53,680
<font color=#FFFF80>What happened to your her?</font>

754
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:56,140
<font color=#FFFF80>I don't know.</font>

755
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:02,500
<font color=#FFFF80>The ministry sent me her ashes, and...</font>

756
01:17:03,710 --> 01:17:06,460
<font color=#FFFF80>They told me she took her own life.</font>

757
01:17:09,690 --> 01:17:12,970
<font color=#FFFF80>But Motoko... No, no, no.</font>

758
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:16,260
<font color=#FFFF80>I never believe them.</font>

759
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:18,830
<font color=#FFFF80>She was happy...</font>

760
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:22,570
<font color=#FFFF80>living in the lawless
zone with her friends.</font>

761
01:17:23,380 --> 01:17:26,770
<font color=#FFFF80>She'd write her manifestos about...</font>

762
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:29,540
<font color=#FFFF80>how technology was...</font>

763
01:17:30,030 --> 01:17:32,610
<font color=#FFFF80>destroying the world.</font>

764
01:17:34,170 --> 01:17:36,240
<font color=#FFFF80>Then one day...</font>

765
01:17:36,690 --> 01:17:38,650
<font color=#FFFF80>the police came...</font>

766
01:17:38,980 --> 01:17:40,720
<font color=#FFFF80>and they run.</font>

767
01:17:48,780 --> 01:17:50,430
<font color=#FFFF80>It's strange.</font>

768
01:17:57,220 --> 01:18:00,860
<font color=#FFFF80>I see her in so many young women.</font>

769
01:18:01,780 --> 01:18:04,960
<font color=#FFFF80>On the street, in my dreams.</font>

770
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:08,140
<font color=#FFFF80>As if she is still here.</font>

771
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:10,840
<font color=#FFFF80>She was...</font>

772
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:13,030
<font color=#FFFF80>fearless.</font>

773
01:18:15,780 --> 01:18:17,540
<font color=#FFFF80>And wild.</font>

774
01:18:18,250 --> 01:18:20,660
<font color=#FFFF80>You remind me of her.</font>

775
01:18:22,170 --> 01:18:23,240
<font color=#FFFF80>Sorry.</font>

776
01:18:27,740 --> 01:18:29,760
<font color=#FFFF80>How do I remind you of her?</font>

777
01:18:31,810 --> 01:18:34,120
<font color=#FFFF80>The way you look at me.</font>

778
01:18:40,330 --> 01:18:41,570
<font color=#FFFF80>Who are you?</font>

779
01:18:45,180 --> 01:18:46,700
<font color=#FFFF80>I don't know.</font>

780
01:18:48,190 --> 01:18:49,860
<font color=#FFFF80>Wait, wait, wait!</font>

781
01:18:51,860 --> 01:18:54,300
<font color=#FFFF80>Will you come again to visit me?</font>

782
01:18:56,140 --> 01:18:57,260
<font color=#FFFF80>I will.</font>

783
01:19:23,660 --> 01:19:25,210
<font color=#FFFF80>Aramaki.</font>

784
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:27,160
<font color=#FFFF80>Listen to me.</font>

785
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:30,130
<font color=#FFFF80>I was never in a terrorist bombing.</font>

786
01:19:30,460 --> 01:19:31,840
<font color=#FFFF80>My parents...</font>

787
01:19:32,670 --> 01:19:35,110
<font color=#FFFF80>Everything was data
they installed in my mind.</font>

788
01:19:36,460 --> 01:19:40,470
<font color=#FFFF80>And there were others.
Run-aways like me...</font>

789
01:19:41,060 --> 01:19:43,070
<font color=#FFFF80>considered disposable.</font>

790
01:19:43,780 --> 01:19:46,660
<font color=#FFFF80>Kuze was one of them.
That's why he's coming.</font>

791
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:48,970
<font color=#FFFF80>For Hanka.</font>

792
01:19:50,970 --> 01:19:52,190
<font color=#FFFF80><i>Can you prove this?</i></font>

793
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:54,260
<font color=#FFFF80>Dr. Ouelet can.</font>

794
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:56,470
<font color=#FFFF80><i>Ouelet's dead.</i></font>

795
01:20:02,290 --> 01:20:04,450
<font color=#FFFF80><i>Cutter says you killed her.</i></font>

796
01:20:09,220 --> 01:20:11,670
<font color=#FFFF80>Put me on the grid. I need Kuze to find me.</font>

797
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:15,400
<font color=#FFFF80><i>We will be exposed to Cutter.</i></font>

798
01:20:15,910 --> 01:20:18,710
<font color=#FFFF80>I know, but I have to do this.</font>

799
01:20:19,460 --> 01:20:23,820
<font color=#FFFF80><i>I'm going to meet with the Prime Minister.</i></font>

800
01:20:24,630 --> 01:20:26,810
<font color=#FFFF80><i>He must be stopped.</i></font>

801
01:20:33,340 --> 01:20:35,200
<font color=#FFFF80>The virus has spread.</font>

802
01:20:58,110 --> 01:21:00,880
<font color=#FFFF80><i>All agents stick to mental comms.</i></font>

<font color=#FFFF80><i>Don't send a rabbit...</i></font>

804
01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:46,150
<font color=#FFFF80><i>to kill a fox.</i></font>

805
01:21:54,510 --> 01:21:56,350
<font color=#FFFF80><i>We are burned.</i></font>

806
01:21:57,940 --> 01:21:59,280
<font color=#FFFF80><i>I repeat.</i></font>

807
01:22:00,530 --> 01:22:02,410
<font color=#FFFF80><i>We are burned.</i></font>

808
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:07,740
<font color=#FFFF80>We have located Major on the grid.
She's in the lawless zone.</font>

809
01:23:08,190 --> 01:23:10,180
<font color=#FFFF80>Air support 5 minutes out.</font>

810
01:23:10,940 --> 01:23:13,380
<font color=#FFFF80>Is the spider tank within range?</font>

811
01:23:14,940 --> 01:23:17,060
<font color=#FFFF80>Yes sir. Awaiting your orders sir.</font>

812
01:24:21,710 --> 01:24:23,380
<font color=#FFFF80>Motoko!</font>

813
01:25:31,730 --> 01:25:33,270
<font color=#FFFF80>It is real.</font>

814
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:38,560
<font color=#FFFF80>This place.</font>

815
01:25:46,290 --> 01:25:48,670
<font color=#FFFF80>I remember what they did to us.</font>

816
01:25:49,070 --> 01:25:53,540
<font color=#FFFF80>Cutter and his men.
This is where they took us from.</font>

817
01:26:00,570 --> 01:26:02,230
<font color=#FFFF80>We used to sleep right here.</font>

818
01:26:04,110 --> 01:26:06,050
<font color=#FFFF80>We were like a family.</font>

819
01:26:06,390 --> 01:26:08,280
<font color=#FFFF80>All of us run away.</font>

820
01:26:09,910 --> 01:26:11,460
<font color=#FFFF80>We had nothing...</font>

821
01:26:15,430 --> 01:26:17,090
<font color=#FFFF80>except each other.</font>

822
01:26:20,910 --> 01:26:22,760
<font color=#FFFF80>They took that from us.</font>

823
01:26:39,170 --> 01:26:41,040
<font color=#FFFF80>Your name was Hideo.</font>

<font color=#FFFF80>Motoko.</font>

825
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:58,370
<font color=#FFFF80>That was your name.</font>

826
01:27:01,940 --> 01:27:03,260
<font color=#FFFF80>Motoko.</font>

827

<font color=#FFFF80>into my network.</font>

829
01:27:12,690 --> 01:27:15,110
<font color=#FFFF80>We will evolve beyond them.</font>

830
01:27:15,890 --> 01:27:20,490
<font color=#FFFF80>And together we can avenge
what they have done to us.</font>

01:27:21,260 --> 01:27:22,260
<font color=#FFFF80>Come...</font>

<font color=#FFFF80>with me.</font>

833
01:27:42,290 --> 01:27:43,820
<font color=#FFFF80>I will take control from here.</font>

834
01:27:44,270 --> 01:27:46,130
<font color=#FFFF80><i>Weapons system manual command.</i></font>

<font color=#FFFF80><i>Spider tank now active</i></font>

836
01:27:58,950 --> 01:28:00,820
<font color=#FFFF80>It's Cutter! He found us!</font>

837
01:29:39,190 --> 01:29:40,400
<font color=#FFFF80><i>Target acquired</i></font>

838
01:29:42,690 --> 01:29:43,740

841
01:30:12,890 --> 01:30:14,240
<font color=#FFFF80>you freak.</font>

844
01:31:34,590 --> 01:31:36,720
<font color=#FFFF80>Approaching the target now sir.</font>

845
01:31:39,050 --> 01:31:40,600
<font color=#FFFF80>Come with me.</font>

846
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,920
<font color=#FFFF80>There is no place for us here.</font>

847
01:31:49,900 --> 01:31:50,990
<font color=#FFFF80>No.</font>

848
01:31:56,780 --> 01:31:59,100
<font color=#FFFF80>I'm not ready to leave.</font>

<font color=#FFFF80>I belong here.</font>

850
01:32:06,050 --> 01:32:08,850
<font color=#FFFF80>I'll always be there with you...</font>

851
01:32:09,830 --> 01:32:11,660
<font color=#FFFF80>your ghost.</font>

852
01:32:18,420 --> 01:32:19,420
<font color=#FFFF80>Target is in view.</font>

853
01:32:19,930 --> 01:32:21,300
<font color=#FFFF80>What are you waiting for?</font>

854
01:32:21,510 --> 01:32:22,510
<font color=#FFFF80>Do it!</font>

855
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:26,440
<font color=#FFFF80>No!</font>

856
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:28,590
<font color=#FFFF80>Keep firing.</font>

857
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:33,720
<font color=#FFFF80><i>Saito, have you found Major? Is she safe?</i></font>

858
01:32:36,310 --> 01:32:37,480
<font color=#FFFF80>She will be.</font>

859
01:32:59,950 --> 01:33:01,030
<font color=#FFFF80>Hey..</font>

860
01:33:03,410 --> 01:33:04,560
<font color=#FFFF80>Hey.</font>

861
01:33:08,340 --> 01:33:10,310
<font color=#FFFF80>Say something nice.</font>

862
01:33:11,750 --> 01:33:13,250
<font color=#FFFF80>What's your name?</font>

863
01:33:13,820 --> 01:33:17,180
<font color=#FFFF80>Aramaki told me you had a name from before.</font>

864
01:33:21,050 --> 01:33:22,800
<font color=#FFFF80>Motoko.</font>

865
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:29,570
<font color=#FFFF80>Major still in there, right?</font>

866
01:33:31,550 --> 01:33:32,980
<font color=#FFFF80>I am.</font>

867
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:49,740
<font color=#FFFF80><i>Mr. Cutter.</i></font>

868
01:33:51,080 --> 01:33:52,510
<font color=#FFFF80><i>I talked with the Prime Minister.</i></font>

869
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:56,100
<font color=#FFFF80><i>You are accused of murder
and crimes against the state.</i></font>

870
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:02,710
<font color=#FFFF80>I thought that it might be you.</font>

871
01:34:06,990 --> 01:34:09,000
<font color=#FFFF80><i>It is unwise to resist.</i></font>

872
01:34:29,290 --> 01:34:30,290
<font color=#FFFF80>Please.</font>

873
01:34:30,750 --> 01:34:31,910
<font color=#FFFF80><i>Major?</i></font>

874
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:34,810
<font color=#FFFF80><i>I am with Cutter.</i></font>

875
01:34:35,540 --> 01:34:37,610
<font color=#FFFF80><i>Do you wanna say anything
before I kill him?</i></font>

876
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:40,450
<font color=#FFFF80>Tell him this is justice.</font>

877
01:34:41,220 --> 01:34:42,980
<font color=#FFFF80>It's what I was built for.</font>

878
01:34:43,890 --> 01:34:46,440
<font color=#FFFF80>So do you give consent?</font>

879
01:34:47,380 --> 01:34:49,030
<font color=#FFFF80>My name is Major.</font>

880
01:34:50,010 --> 01:34:51,900
<font color=#FFFF80>And I give my consent.</font>

881
01:36:02,950 --> 01:36:05,300
<font color=#FFFF80>You don't have to come here anymore.</font>

882
01:36:08,060 --> 01:36:09,620
<font color=#FFFF80>I know.</font>

883
01:36:44,100 --> 01:36:46,870
<font color=#FFFF80>My mind is human.</font>

884
01:36:48,340 --> 01:36:50,420
<font color=#FFFF80>My body is manufactured.</font>

885
01:36:52,440 --> 01:36:54,400
<font color=#FFFF80>I am the first of my kind, but...</font>

886
01:36:56,100 --> 01:36:57,770
<font color=#FFFF80>I won't be the last.</font>

887
01:37:02,250 --> 01:37:05,560
<font color=#FFFF80>We cling to memories
as if they define us.</font>

888
01:37:06,750 --> 01:37:09,710
<font color=#FFFF80>But what we do defines us.</font>

889
01:37:16,110 --> 01:37:19,260
<font color=#FFFF80>My ghost survived
to remind the next of us...</font>

890
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:23,330
<font color=#FFFF80>that humanity is our virtue.</font>

891
01:37:25,270 --> 01:37:27,100
<font color=#FFFF80>I know who I am...</font>

892
01:37:28,150 --> 01:37:29,980
<font color=#FFFF80>and what I'm here to do.</font>

893
01:37:34,510 --> 01:37:35,320
<font color=#FFFF80><i>Major.</i></font>

894
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:37,350
<font color=#FFFF80><i>Engage targets.</i></font>

895
01:37:52,180 --> 01:37:53,770
<font color=#FFFF80><i>You're authorized.</i></font>
