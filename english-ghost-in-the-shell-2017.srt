00:05:49,655 --> 00:05:51,474
Just breathe.

18
00:05:52,964 --> 00:05:54,369
Breathe.

19
00:05:56,254 --> 00:05:57,651
Good.

20
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,566
That's good.

Hello Mira.

22
00:06:04,866 --> 00:06:06,755
I'm Dr. Ouelet.

23
00:06:09,964 --> 00:06:13,041
Do you remember anything
about the attack?

24
00:06:14,149 --> 00:06:15,814
What...?

25
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,894
I was... drowning.

26
00:06:20,183 --> 00:06:21,682
There was water.

27
00:06:22,365 --> 00:06:26,174
That's right, you were on a boat.
A refugee boat.

28
00:06:26,444 --> 00:06:28,720
It was sunk by terrorists.

29
00:06:29,464 --> 00:06:31,908
Why can't I feel my body?

30
00:06:32,264 --> 00:06:35,212
Mira, your body was damaged,
we couldn't save it.

31
00:06:35,598 --> 00:06:37,790
Only your brain survived.

32
00:06:38,203 --> 00:06:40,384
We made you a new body.

33
00:06:40,904 --> 00:06:42,671
A synthetic shell.

34
00:06:44,442 --> 00:06:47,244
But your mind, your soul,

35
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:48,937
your ghost,

36
00:06:49,128 --> 00:06:50,919
it's still in there.

37
00:06:53,703 --> 00:06:54,703
Please.

38
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,169
Sedate her.

39
00:07:11,102 --> 00:07:12,762
Will it work?

40
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,886
Absolutely.

41
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,362
She's a miracle.

42
00:07:19,201 --> 00:07:22,352
A machine can't lead,
it can only follow orders.

43
00:07:22,559 --> 00:07:25,506
A machine can't imagine,
or care, or intuit.

44
00:07:25,744 --> 00:07:29,133
But as a human mind in
a cybernetic frame,

45
00:07:29,438 --> 00:07:31,868
Mira can do all those things
and more.

46
00:07:31,888 --> 00:07:34,008
The first of her kind.

47
00:07:36,234 --> 00:07:39,231
She will join Section 9
as soon as she's operational.

48
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,659
Please don't do that.

49
00:07:41,859 --> 00:07:45,259
You're reducing a complex human
to a machine.

50
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:47,756
I don't think of her as a machine.

51
00:07:49,059 --> 00:07:50,714
She's a weapon.

52
00:07:51,384 --> 00:07:53,674
And the future of my company.

53
00:08:08,717 --> 00:08:11,981

<i>Repeat: All patrolling area units,

65
00:09:05,707 --> 00:09:08,293
This is Major.
I'm on site.

66
00:09:08,357 --> 00:09:10,414
Awaiting instructions.

67
00:09:11,475 --> 00:09:13,140
<i>Analyze and report.</i>

68
00:09:22,952 --> 00:09:25,619
I'm human, I'm flawed,

69
00:09:26,077 --> 00:09:29,162
but I embrace change

70
00:09:29,392 --> 00:09:31,447
and enhancement.

71
00:09:31,535 --> 00:09:33,388
Now, there's nothing I can't do.

72
00:09:34,092 --> 00:09:38,346
Nothing I can't know, nothing I can't be.

73
00:09:39,074 --> 00:09:40,840
I want you to listen to something.

74
00:09:42,574 --> 00:09:49,340
<i>Au clair de la lune,
mon ami Pierrot.</i>

75
00:09:50,682 --> 00:09:52,263
It's my 4 year old daughter.

76
00:09:52,311 --> 00:09:55,794
In the time it took her to sing that
lullaby she learned to speak fluent French.

77
00:09:55,908 --> 00:09:57,819
<i>Do you know that song...?</i>

78
00:09:57,949 --> 00:10:00,403
<i>- Is there an echo box up here?
- Why do you ask?</i>

79
00:10:00,445 --> 00:10:02,147
Someone's scanning data traffic.

80
00:10:02,947 --> 00:10:05,209
<i>Trace where it's transmitting.</i>

81
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:06,990
Let's see who's worth
this kind of surveillance.

82
00:10:10,218 --> 00:10:12,655
Accessing hotel security network.

83
00:10:17,721 --> 00:10:21,534
What are you seeing, sir?
I've got a lot of hotel to scan.

84
00:10:23,015 --> 00:10:27,256
<i>There is a banquet room reserved for
the President of the African Federation.</i>

85
00:10:27,654 --> 00:10:30,915
<i>Dr. Osmond is invited
on behalf of Hanka Robotics.</i>

86
00:10:34,275 --> 00:10:36,550
Got it. 43rd floor.

87
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:40,942
Someone's contacted the president's staff.
Someone's watching him.

88
00:10:41,105 --> 00:10:44,472
Dr. Osmond,
what is it you want from us?

89
00:10:44,569 --> 00:10:47,689
I think it's more about what
Hanka Robotics can do for you.

90
00:10:48,219 --> 00:10:52,852
73% of this world has woken up
to the age of cyber enhancement.

91
00:10:53,049 --> 00:10:54,782
Do you really wanna be left behind?

92
00:10:54,986 --> 00:10:59,305
My people embrace cyber enhancement,
as do I.

93
00:10:59,682 --> 00:11:02,405
There's no one who really
understands the risk

94
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,836
to individuality, identity,
messing with the human soul.

95
00:11:08,853 --> 00:11:10,773
Gentlemen, excuse me,
I think you have the wrong...

96
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:18,052
Hallway. Six men.
Shots fired.

97
00:11:18,457 --> 00:11:20,149
Section 9 ETA?

98
00:11:20,163 --> 00:11:22,040
- Two minutes out, Major.
- Too long.

99
00:11:22,222 --> 00:11:23,711
I'm going in.

100
00:11:24,007 --> 00:11:25,007
<i>Hold!</i>

101
00:11:32,964 --> 00:11:34,258
<i>Mayor, stop!</i>

102
00:11:38,108 --> 00:11:41,224
I've heard this speech before
from your competitors.

103
00:11:41,614 --> 00:11:44,957
- And now Hanka Robotics serves it...
- What are you doing?

104
00:11:47,504 --> 00:11:49,054
Look.
This is what I'm talking about.

105
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:55,779
<i>Major!</i>

106
00:12:19,748 --> 00:12:22,628
<i>Initiate the hack.</i>

107
00:13:38,922 --> 00:13:41,897
<i>Help me. Please.
Don't let me die.</i>

108
00:13:42,266 --> 00:13:43,266

109
00:13:43,415 --> 00:13:44,970
<i>Help me. Please.</i>

110
00:13:45,103 --> 00:13:46,250

00:14:14,798 --> 00:14:16,467
You're injured.

114
00:14:26,075 --> 00:14:27,948
You're not the same.

115
00:14:29,121 --> 00:14:32,397

<i>DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE,
CENTRAL OFFICE, SECTION 9</i>

118
00:16:18,995 --> 00:16:21,927
- So what do we have on Osmond?
- So far, very little.

119
00:16:23,186 --> 00:16:26,454
He was the head
of Hanka's Robotics Division.

120
00:16:26,564 --> 00:16:29,083
Human,
but of course cyber enhanced.

121
00:16:29,084 --> 00:16:30,991
So how did they hack him?

122
00:16:31,002 --> 00:16:33,652
Somehow this geisha bot
got past his encryption.

123
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,434
Something's different.

124
00:16:35,822 --> 00:16:36,931
What'd you get?

125
00:16:37,101 --> 00:16:39,290
Why are you always thinking
he's out there enhancing.

126
00:16:39,553 --> 00:16:41,115
Because he is.

127
00:16:41,641 --> 00:16:43,345
Cyber mech liver.

128
00:16:43,352 --> 00:16:46,977
Been saving up for a while.
Now it's last call every night.

129
00:16:47,165 --> 00:16:49,481
You got enhanced
so you can drink more?

130
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:53,727
Embrace enhancements, Togusa.
We wouldn't be here without it.

131
00:16:54,462 --> 00:16:56,723
I'm all human and happy,
thanks.

132
00:16:57,978 --> 00:17:00,351
Any more information
about the seized geisha bot?

133
00:17:00,643 --> 00:17:02,004
Hanka's running scans.

134
00:17:02,377 --> 00:17:04,494
Dr. Dahlin will have the
reports ready but...

135
00:17:07,822 --> 00:17:10,062
<i>I've been talking to the Prime Minister.</i>

136

138
00:17:19,787 --> 00:17:21,496
Following last night's attack,

139
00:17:22,358 --> 00:17:24,664
3 more Hanka scientists
were murdered,

140
00:17:25,017 --> 00:17:26,741
at the company's central laboratory.

141
00:17:27,934 --> 00:17:29,664
The first two were shot.

142
00:17:30,064 --> 00:17:33,508
And the third was beaten to death
by his own service robot.

143
00:17:34,447 --> 00:17:37,596
All showed signs of cerebral hacking.

144
00:17:38,481 --> 00:17:40,789
The same as the geisha did to Osmond.

145
00:17:41,341 --> 00:17:44,910
And all were senior figures in Hanka.

146
00:17:45,402 --> 00:17:46,890
Just like Osmond.

147
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:51,459
A message was left
at each of the crime scenes

148
00:17:51,469 --> 00:17:53,354
by someone identifying himself...

149

and my responsibility</i>

161
00:18:53,139 --> 00:18:55,776
I will find him and I will kill him.

162
00:18:56,339 --> 00:18:59,616
It's what I am built for, isn't it?

163
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,466
<i>You are more than just a weapon.</i>

164
00:19:08,734 --> 00:19:12,344
<i>You have a soul, a ghost.</i>

165
00:19:13,233 --> 00:19:17,508
<i>When we see our
uniqueness as a virtue,</i>

166
00:19:17,538 --> 00:19:20,716
<i>only then will we find peace.</i>

167
00:19:24,544 --> 00:19:28,443
<i>Safely reconfiguring the
child's genetic structure.</i>

168
00:19:28,847 --> 00:19:31,070
<i>Families built better.</i>

169
00:19:31,084 --> 00:19:33,915
What was going on with
you at the hotel last night?

170
00:19:33,924 --> 00:19:36,441
- Nothing, I'm fine.
- You sure?

171
00:19:37,457 --> 00:19:40,218
<i>- Hey, sweetheart, want an upgrade?
- Move.</i>

172
00:19:40,318 --> 00:19:43,012
<i>- I have anything you want.
- Back off!</i>

173
00:19:45,496 --> 00:19:47,620
- Hey, Ming!
- Hey, Batou!

174
00:19:51,009 --> 00:19:52,921
- Got your bones.
- Thanks man.

175
00:19:52,951 --> 00:19:55,456
- What are they for?
- For the dogs.

176
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,639
For someone who doesn't like people
how come you care about dogs so much?

177
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:02,107
Don't know. I like just strays
and they like me.

178
00:20:02,441 --> 00:20:04,168
They like you 'cause you feed them.

179
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,469
You got no heart.

180
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,370
Hey, girls!

181
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,290
Hey Gabriel!

182
00:20:16,611 --> 00:20:17,731
Meet Major.

183
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,612
Major, Gabriel.

184
00:20:23,717 --> 00:20:25,484
I used to have a dog.

185
00:20:25,886 --> 00:20:26,975
Seriously?

186
00:20:30,753 --> 00:20:33,593
I had you down, as more of a cat person.

187
00:20:38,078 --> 00:20:40,263
You don't talk about that stuff.

188
00:20:40,545 --> 00:20:41,545
What?

189
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:44,520
- Your past.
- I don't remember much.

190
00:20:44,825 --> 00:20:46,482
Just fragments, bits and pieces.

191
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:49,858
What about family?

192
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:52,693
My parents, they died
bringing us to this country.

193
00:20:52,696 --> 00:20:56,488
Our boat sank in the harbor.
I almost drowned.

194
00:20:58,389 --> 00:21:02,160
It feels like there's always
this thick fog over my memory

195
00:21:02,233 --> 00:21:04,060
and I can't seen through it.

196
00:21:04,914 --> 00:21:06,060
You're lucky.

197
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:08,980
Every single day,
I get screwed by my memories.

198
00:21:09,205 --> 00:21:10,966
It's better to be pure.

199
00:21:11,374 --> 00:21:12,591
Like you.

200
00:21:26,105 --> 00:21:29,077
<i>HANKA CENTRAL OFFICE OF ROBOTICS</i>

201
00:21:30,761 --> 00:21:33,386
<i>Welcome to Hanka Robotics.</i>

202
00:21:34,604 --> 00:21:38,486

203
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:44,571
Opens and close, please.

204
00:21:46,367 --> 00:21:48,759
Your have damaged internal systems.

205
00:21:49,068 --> 00:21:51,392
Maybe next time you can design me better.

206
00:21:55,223 --> 00:21:57,676
- How are you?
- I'm fine. I can't feel anything.

207
00:21:57,683 --> 00:22:00,320
No you, in There.

208
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:03,883
I've been having glitches.

209
00:22:04,736 --> 00:22:06,098
But they'll pass.

210
00:22:06,513 --> 00:22:09,128
- Have you been taking your medication?
- Yeah.

211
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:12,714
These ones are still cycling.
I had two this morning.

212
00:22:13,111 --> 00:22:15,410
- Sound or image?
- Both.

213
00:22:19,307 --> 00:22:20,737
I see it.

214
00:22:21,806 --> 00:22:23,858
You made any unencrypted downloads?

215
00:22:24,204 --> 00:22:26,396
- No. Just delete them from me.
- Consent?

216
00:22:26,623 --> 00:22:30,529
My name is Major Mary Killian.
I give my consent to delete this data.

217
00:22:30,989 --> 00:22:32,100
It's done.

218
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:35,045
- No big deal.
- What are they?

219
00:22:35,995 --> 00:22:38,511
Sensory echoes from your mind, shadows.

220
00:22:38,794 --> 00:22:39,857
I'm not sure.

221
00:22:40,169 --> 00:22:41,889
How do you know what's a glitch
and what's me?

222
00:22:42,266 --> 00:22:44,909
The glitches have a different texture...

223
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:47,179
to the rest of your code.

224
00:22:49,486 --> 00:22:50,988
I can see everything.

225
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:55,681
All of your thoughts, your... decisions.

226
00:22:56,101 --> 00:22:59,917
- I guess privacy is just for humans.
- You are human.

227
00:23:01,236 --> 00:23:03,051
People see you as human.

228
00:23:03,218 --> 00:23:05,587
Everyone around me seems to fit.

229
00:23:06,096 --> 00:23:11,140
They seem connected to something.
Something I'm... not.

230
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,727
- It's like I have no past.
- Of course you have a past.

231
00:23:16,018 --> 00:23:19,430
And with time you'll feel more and more
connected to it and to them.

232
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,061
Opens and close, please.

233
00:23:33,905 --> 00:23:37,205
We cling to memories
as if they define us, but...

234
00:23:38,582 --> 00:23:40,069
they really don't.

235
00:23:41,457 --> 00:23:43,851
What we do is what defines us.

236
00:23:46,546 --> 00:23:50,455
<i>You are entering a Hanka secure area.
Authorized personnel only.</i>

237
00:23:50,856 --> 00:23:53,923
<i>Please disable communication enhancement.</i>

238
00:23:54,772 --> 00:23:56,033
I'm busy.

239
00:23:56,225 --> 00:23:58,652
Dr. Dahlin!
Are you finished yet?

240
00:23:58,995 --> 00:24:01,075
If you hadn't riddled
the Geisha with bullets,

241
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:02,190
this would be much easier.

242
00:24:02,646 --> 00:24:04,908
- I didn't shoot'em.
- I did.

243
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:08,132
This is gonna take days.

244
00:24:08,796 --> 00:24:11,052
I need to run hundreds
of potential simulations.

245
00:24:11,298 --> 00:24:12,918
We don't have the time.

246
00:24:15,936 --> 00:24:18,684
She was a Hanka companion bot.

247
00:24:19,733 --> 00:24:22,260
But she was reprogrammed
for cerebral hacking.

248
00:24:23,539 --> 00:24:25,055
What was on her drives?

249
00:24:25,479 --> 00:24:28,655
Nothing. The data was destroyed
as it was transmitted.

250
00:24:29,481 --> 00:24:32,095
No sign of what she was after.

251
00:24:32,115 --> 00:24:34,277
Her hardware was vandalized.

252
00:24:34,934 --> 00:24:36,650
They ripped her up.

253
00:24:36,971 --> 00:24:38,936
Then I have to do a deep dive.

254
00:24:39,459 --> 00:24:41,917
You can't encrypt during a deep dive

255
00:24:42,203 --> 00:24:43,556
I know.

256
00:24:44,965 --> 00:24:49,439
They could've left traps in her.
Mag pulses, viruses.

257
00:24:49,769 --> 00:24:50,872
She's right.

258
00:24:51,463 --> 00:24:55,686
You will be exposing your mind to
who ever hacked her. You'll be wide open.

259
00:24:58,907 --> 00:25:03,203
I have to get inside her memory.
It's the fastest way to find Kuze.

260
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,611
It's too dangerous.

261
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:13,297
And highly irresponsible.

262
00:25:18,223 --> 00:25:19,600
Are you sure?

263
00:25:20,012 --> 00:25:23,268
You see any bad code headed my way,
pull me out.

264
00:25:26,019 --> 00:25:28,411
How come you're the one sweating?

265
00:25:36,188 --> 00:25:37,242
Run it.

266
00:25:45,989 --> 00:25:49,218
Cyber mind connection to the Major,
now active...

267
00:25:49,522 --> 00:25:51,223
and unencrypted

268
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:54,850
consent required for data download.

269
00:25:55,147 --> 00:25:58,668
My name is Major Mira Killian
and I give my consent.

270
00:27:38,536 --> 00:27:39,965
Disconnect. Get her out.

271
00:27:40,375 --> 00:27:43,449
- Get her out!
- I'm trying, but she's being hacked.

272
00:27:47,091 --> 00:27:48,747
Get her out now!

273
00:27:51,694 --> 00:27:53,010
Now!

274
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,168
Are you okay?

275
00:28:15,733 --> 00:28:16,842
I know this place.

276
00:28:17,351 --> 00:28:18,885
They run black market here.

277
00:28:20,392 --> 00:28:21,501
You tooled up?

278
00:28:21,524 --> 00:28:24,044
- Yep.
- Target is in the basement. I'll lead.

279
00:28:24,567 --> 00:28:25,976
Switching to mind coms.

280
00:28:26,985 --> 00:28:29,453
- Hope you've been practicing.
- That's unfair.

281
00:28:30,738 --> 00:28:33,030
Just text me the moment
you are in.

282
00:28:33,353 --> 00:28:34,808
Get the hang of it.

283
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:48,290
Two mercs at the door.
Armed and enhanced.

284
00:28:48,397 --> 00:28:50,909
Copy that.
We got it covered.

285
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:03,887
There's a lot of heat in here
for a nightclub.

286
00:29:03,891 --> 00:29:07,002
It's a Yakuza club. What did you expect?

287
00:29:07,424 --> 00:29:08,807
I quite like the place.

288
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:11,091
Why doesn't that surprise me?

289
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:15,960
I'm gonna have to draw some attention.
See if I can access the basement that way.

290
00:29:19,902 --> 00:29:22,301
You're not here
looking for any trouble, are you?

291
00:29:22,312 --> 00:29:25,133
I'm just here for the girls... and beer.

292
00:29:28,712 --> 00:29:31,199
- Can I help you?
- I'm looking for someone.

293
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:32,557
You been here before?

294
00:29:32,831 --> 00:29:35,679
My friend had some mech work done here.
Industry stuff.

295
00:29:35,751 --> 00:29:37,091
We don't do mech work here.

296
00:29:37,887 --> 00:29:39,149
My mistake.

297
00:29:39,912 --> 00:29:43,089
Why don't you come have fun with us?
Have some privacy.

298
00:29:51,312 --> 00:29:52,312
I'm in.

299
00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:54,496
I'll be here when you need me.

300
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:11,179
- You say your friend worked here?
- I said my friend had work done here.

301
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:13,651
She's human?

302
00:30:14,393 --> 00:30:15,662
Your friend.

303
00:30:16,213 --> 00:30:18,213
What's that supposed to mean?

304
00:30:18,462 --> 00:30:19,544
Batou.

305
00:30:19,992 --> 00:30:20,992
Can you hear me?

306
00:30:21,314 --> 00:30:25,034
Who did this stunning work on you?

307
00:30:25,833 --> 00:30:27,074
It's divine.

308
00:30:34,063 --> 00:30:35,305
Ladriya... guns.

309
00:30:36,433 --> 00:30:37,553
Here.

310
00:30:40,642 --> 00:30:42,242
Batou, I'm losing signal.

311
00:30:42,612 --> 00:30:44,543
Don't worry sweety.

312
00:30:45,597 --> 00:30:47,029
We have privacy.

313
00:30:48,833 --> 00:30:49,833
Listen.

314
00:30:50,353 --> 00:30:52,599
No signals going in or out.

315
00:30:53,612 --> 00:30:56,231
Major, I'm in position. Do you copy?

316
00:30:57,441 --> 00:30:58,441
Beer.

317
00:31:00,062 --> 00:31:02,645
If you don't answer,
you're gonna hurt my feelings.

318
00:31:10,544 --> 00:31:12,834
Ladriya, do you have Major on Comms?

319
00:31:13,155 --> 00:31:15,635
Got nothing. Signal's still blocked.

320
00:31:16,235 --> 00:31:18,864
I'm afraid I get bored rather easily, so...

321
00:31:19,514 --> 00:31:21,134
You don't wanna talk...

322
00:31:22,955 --> 00:31:25,098
Maybe you wanna dance!

323
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:29,536
Major, come on. Answer me.

324
00:31:45,731 --> 00:31:47,451
I thought you said no trouble.

325
00:31:48,507 --> 00:31:49,545
Dance!

326
00:31:56,262 --> 00:31:57,394
The truth is...

327
00:31:59,071 --> 00:32:00,690
I wasn't built to dance.

328
00:32:54,668 --> 00:32:57,620
Back on comms.
I'm heading to the back room.

329
00:32:58,557 --> 00:33:01,587
I missed you. I'll meet you there.

330
00:33:32,815 --> 00:33:36,282
<i>Collaborate with Hanka Robotics
and be destroyed.</i>

331
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:48,090
Major?

332
00:34:21,227 --> 00:34:22,695
Where's Batou?

333
00:34:23,286 --> 00:34:26,522
In enhancement, next door.
He's doing well.

334
00:34:28,413 --> 00:34:30,580
You took most of the blast.

335
00:34:33,547 --> 00:34:35,458
I saw him down there.

336
00:34:37,237 --> 00:34:38,623
It was like...

337
00:34:40,246 --> 00:34:42,188
He waited to see me.

338
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,831
We synaptic scanned you.

339
00:34:45,169 --> 00:34:48,465
Everything you witnessed
went to Section 9 to evaluate.

340
00:34:51,109 --> 00:34:53,035
You know, the scan...

341
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:55,630
also turned up the number of glitches.

342
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:58,356
They've been getting worse.

343
00:35:00,251 --> 00:35:01,487
Since when?

344
00:35:02,542 --> 00:35:04,079
Since the deep dive.

345
00:35:20,581 --> 00:35:23,338
Do any of the glitches
mean something to you?

346
00:35:24,738 --> 00:35:25,862
No.

347
00:35:27,028 --> 00:35:28,028
They don't.

348
00:35:30,277 --> 00:35:33,052
You've been inside
the same shell as he has.

349
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:37,582
That could have very serious consequences.

350
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:41,739
You were not authorized
to deep dive the geisha.

351
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:44,598
You're disappointed.

352
00:35:46,093 --> 00:35:47,829
No, I'm worried.

353
00:35:50,346 --> 00:35:52,157
You're not invulnerable.

354
00:35:53,106 --> 00:35:56,707
I can repair your body,
but I can't protect your mind.

355
00:35:57,509 --> 00:35:58,805
Why not?

356
00:36:02,229 --> 00:36:04,556
You can see all my thoughts so...

357
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:07,006
You should be able to secure them.

358
00:36:08,365 --> 00:36:11,418
Try and understand
your importance Mira.

359
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:17,393
You're what everyone will become one day.

360
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:22,927
You don't know how alone
that makes me feel.

361
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:42,662
I can see you out there, you know.

362
00:36:45,473 --> 00:36:47,346
How many fingers am I holding up?

363
00:36:48,601 --> 00:36:49,640
Funny.

364
00:36:58,901 --> 00:37:00,748
Say something nice.

365
00:37:02,152 --> 00:37:03,852
You chose those?

366
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:05,776
They're tactical.

367
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:09,847
- Always for the job.
- What else I got?

368
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:12,349
- They suit you.
- Yeah?

369
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:15,181
I got night vision, zoom...

370
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:16,870
and X-ray.

371
00:37:18,635 --> 00:37:20,308
I guess I see like you now.

372
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:23,434
Don't worry, you'll get used to it.

373
00:37:26,062 --> 00:37:27,709
Thanks for saving my ass.

374
00:37:28,757 --> 00:37:30,582
Glad to see you're okay.

375
00:37:31,388 --> 00:37:32,524
Major?

376
00:37:33,953 --> 00:37:35,839
Could you feed the dogs for me?

377
00:37:37,457 --> 00:37:38,927
I don't wanna scare them.

378
00:37:39,232 --> 00:37:40,531
Anytime.

379
00:38:24,555 --> 00:38:27,586
Are you insufficiently funded, Mr. Aramaki?

380
00:38:28,196 --> 00:38:31,484
Is section 9 missing some
critical operational resource?

381
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:34,681
<i>We have everything that we require.</i>

382
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:39,225
Major is our most sophisticated weapon
only if she's intact.

383
00:38:40,984 --> 00:38:45,750
And Dr. Ouelet informed me that
you let her dive a corrupted geisha.

384
00:38:54,306 --> 00:38:56,230
You realize the supreme importance

385
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:58,076
that Hanka represents to this government.

386
00:38:59,155 --> 00:39:01,786
Major is the future of my company.

387
00:39:02,533 --> 00:39:05,185
If you compromise
your systems again...

388
00:39:06,004 --> 00:39:07,810
I will burn this section.

389
00:39:11,362 --> 00:39:12,680
<i>Yes sir.</i>

390
00:39:14,646 --> 00:39:16,037
<i>Mr. Cutter.</i>

391
00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:18,728
<i>Be careful who you the threaten.</i>

392
00:39:19,071 --> 00:39:22,887
<i>I'm accountable to the Prime Minister,
not to Hanka.</i>

393
00:40:09,098 --> 00:40:12,767
<i>Create your own beauty.
Beauty enhanced.</i>

394
00:40:23,566 --> 00:40:25,043
You human?

395
00:40:26,627 --> 00:40:27,627
Yeah.

396
00:40:33,718 --> 00:40:35,144
Can you take that off?

397
00:40:35,709 --> 00:40:37,824
So I can see your face?

398
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,109
What does that feel like?

399
00:41:05,499 --> 00:41:06,499
It feels...

400
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,365
different.

401
00:41:19,754 --> 00:41:21,427
What are you?

402
00:41:38,567 --> 00:41:40,084
SECURE PROJECT 2571

403
00:41:49,355 --> 00:41:50,795
HANKA PERSONNEL FILES

404
00:41:58,090 --> 00:41:59,090
Look at me.

405
00:42:02,071 --> 00:42:04,405
Tell me what they took from me.

406
00:42:06,251 --> 00:42:09,504
I'm sorry.
They never told us.

407
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:34,686
It feels weird driving
with these eyes.

408
00:42:38,326 --> 00:42:39,837
Why do you take that?

409
00:42:40,144 --> 00:42:43,139
Keeps my brain from rejecting
this body.

410
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:47,492
Major, Batou, you need to get here.

411
00:42:47,833 --> 00:42:48,833
What've you got?

412
00:42:49,071 --> 00:42:51,456
Another Hanka scientist
has been found dead.

413
00:42:51,877 --> 00:42:53,031
It's Dahlin.

414
00:42:53,552 --> 00:42:54,552
Got it.

415
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:03,360
Major this way.

416
00:43:30,391 --> 00:43:32,875
<i>SECURE - PROJECT 2571</i>

417
00:43:33,312 --> 00:43:34,532
What is that?

418
00:43:35,891 --> 00:43:38,300
She found what Kuze stole from Osmond.

419
00:43:39,148 --> 00:43:43,863
It's a list of everyone
who worked on a project called 2571.

420
00:43:44,434 --> 00:43:45,856
That's who he's targeting.

421
00:43:46,423 --> 00:43:48,163
Is there anyone else on that list?

422
00:43:48,971 --> 00:43:50,768
<i>DR. OUELET</i>

423
00:43:51,118 --> 00:43:53,369
Find Ouelet. Now!

424
00:43:53,502 --> 00:43:56,543
She's in transit. Her comms are down.

425
00:44:01,157 --> 00:44:03,255
<i>I'm looking at her and I'mm thinking:</i>

426
00:44:03,672 --> 00:44:05,712
<i>"You want me to pay for violin too?"</i>

427
00:44:05,982 --> 00:44:07,290
<i>Don't get me wrong.</i>

428
00:44:08,126 --> 00:44:09,975
<i>I love that kid to pieces.</i>

429
00:44:10,473 --> 00:44:12,160
<i>I do. She's amazing.</i>

430
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:15,392
<i>But when she practices that thing,
it is painful, right?</i>

431
00:44:16,473 --> 00:44:17,473
<i>Why not piano?</i>

432
00:44:17,992 --> 00:44:22,273
<i>I mean, it's the same price,
and doesn't sound so bad.</i>

433
00:44:24,452 --> 00:44:26,972
<i>At least if you can't play that proper,
it sounds...</i>

434
00:45:16,614 --> 00:45:19,152
<i>2-5-7-1!
Tell me everything!</i>

435
00:45:31,175 --> 00:45:33,125
<i>Are you prepare
to die for 2-5-7...?</i>

436
00:45:42,234 --> 00:45:43,234
Go!

437
00:45:58,295 --> 00:45:59,295
Go!

438
00:47:57,198 --> 00:47:58,198
Who is Kuze?

439
00:47:58,582 --> 00:48:00,948
- Why does he wanna kill Ouelet?
- I don't know anything.

440
00:48:03,696 --> 00:48:05,675
Enough, enough!

441
00:48:07,852 --> 00:48:09,282
We need him alive.

442
00:48:13,101 --> 00:48:15,750
Please. I have been through this.

443
00:48:16,938 --> 00:48:18,917
You have the wrong guy.

444
00:48:20,088 --> 00:48:22,462
So tell us who we do have.

445
00:48:23,906 --> 00:48:27,242
My name is Lee Cunningham.

446
00:48:30,898 --> 00:48:32,921
- Where'd you get the weapons?
- I don't know.

447
00:48:33,143 --> 00:48:33,829
Who loaded the...?

448
00:48:33,929 --> 00:48:36,337
I don't know anything about the weapons,
alright I told you.

449
00:48:36,537 --> 00:48:39,032
I was picking up my daughter.
She takes violin lessons.

450
00:48:39,251 --> 00:48:40,697
What's her name?

451
00:48:43,897 --> 00:48:48,443
- Is this her?
- Yeah. Isn't she a little angel?

452
00:48:48,784 --> 00:48:50,676
- This is your daughter?
- Right.

453
00:48:53,398 --> 00:48:54,896
Do you have kids?

454
00:48:58,417 --> 00:48:59,723
Where do you live?

455
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:03,319
I can't remember.

456
00:49:03,639 --> 00:49:06,620
I think it's a tall place.
Is it a tall building?

457
00:49:07,019 --> 00:49:08,724
It's a tall place, right?

458
00:49:10,064 --> 00:49:11,630
You don't have a child.

459
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:17,812
You don't have a wife.
You live alone, just you.

460
00:49:17,998 --> 00:49:19,631
- What? No.
- We went to your apartment.

461
00:49:19,661 --> 00:49:20,994
- There was nobody there.
- No.

462
00:49:21,194 --> 00:49:22,610
You live there for
10 years by yourself.

463
00:49:22,634 --> 00:49:22,881
No.

464
00:49:23,081 --> 00:49:25,282
- You're just lying.
- I'm not lying.

465
00:49:26,345 --> 00:49:27,951
I didn't kill anyone!

466
00:49:28,189 --> 00:49:30,470
- Why do you keep doing this to me?
- Holocube disconnect.

467
00:49:30,898 --> 00:49:31,898
Please!

468
00:49:32,648 --> 00:49:34,608
I didn't do anything.

469
00:49:34,974 --> 00:49:37,122
Why do you keep
saying this to me?

470
00:49:37,342 --> 00:49:39,502
I don't understand. How can he not know?

471
00:49:39,952 --> 00:49:43,581
The hack must have created a vacuum.
Kuze's wiped his memory...

472
00:49:44,017 --> 00:49:46,507
and somehow installed a new reality.

473
00:49:47,975 --> 00:49:50,303
At least he got to believe he had a kid.

474
00:49:51,438 --> 00:49:53,074
What's the difference huh?

475
00:49:54,536 --> 00:49:56,369
Fantasy, reality...

476
00:49:56,769 --> 00:49:58,547
Dreams, memories...

477
00:49:59,509 --> 00:50:01,182
it's all the same.

478
00:50:01,985 --> 00:50:03,543
Just noise.

479
00:50:05,344 --> 00:50:06,344
It's him.

480
00:50:09,419 --> 00:50:10,873
He's in there.

481
00:50:13,485 --> 00:50:15,903
This cube is secure. He can't be, Major.

482
00:50:16,384 --> 00:50:17,617
The lie detector!

483
00:50:17,841 --> 00:50:19,266
He must've hacked in that way.

484
00:50:19,426 --> 00:50:22,196
We should uplink to the machine,
trace the code, get a lock on his location.

485
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:23,220
Do it.

486
00:50:23,595 --> 00:50:25,693
Don't go in there.
It's too dangerous.

487
00:50:26,451 --> 00:50:28,022
<i>Major</i>

488
00:50:28,476 --> 00:50:30,939
<i>We don't know what else he can do.</i>

489
00:50:42,499 --> 00:50:45,652
The signal's unstable.
Can you get the lock on him?

490
00:50:45,813 --> 00:50:47,421
We gotta move fast.
We're losing him.

491
00:50:47,751 --> 00:50:48,839
Connecting.

492
00:50:51,623 --> 00:50:52,786
Who are you?

493
00:50:55,902 --> 00:50:57,087
Come here.

494
00:50:59,503 --> 00:51:00,786
I'm shy.

495
00:51:01,966 --> 00:51:04,132
I'm not beautiful...

496
00:51:04,623 --> 00:51:05,644
like you.

497
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:10,641
Tell me who you are.

498
00:51:10,947 --> 00:51:13,859
I have been born more than once.

499
00:51:14,568 --> 00:51:17,128
So I have more than one name

500
00:51:17,701 --> 00:51:19,182
I'll find you.

501
00:51:19,666 --> 00:51:21,119
Not yet.

502
00:51:21,842 --> 00:51:23,300
I'm not done.

503
00:51:23,605 --> 00:51:25,684
The machine's tracing his location.

504
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:27,256
We got a fix!

505
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,563
I need to see her.

506
00:51:35,101 --> 00:51:36,600
No Please. I know..what...

507
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:38,048
We got'im.

508
00:51:46,503 --> 00:51:47,573
Let's go.

509
00:51:50,603 --> 00:52:01,603
P S A G M E N O .com

510
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:03,535
Weapons armed.

511
00:52:06,227 --> 00:52:07,754
- Go.
- On me.

512
00:52:55,794 --> 00:52:57,658
Stay Down! Stay Down!

513
00:53:07,553 --> 00:53:09,357
Put it down, put it down.

514
00:53:16,782 --> 00:53:17,782
Grenade!

515
00:54:14,624 --> 00:54:15,822
Major!

516
00:54:16,354 --> 00:54:17,633
Come in.

517
00:54:18,875 --> 00:54:20,888
I know why we couldn't find him.

518
00:54:23,945 --> 00:54:26,973
He's using human minds
to create a network of his own.

519
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:28,615
We're coming to your position.

520
00:55:43,851 --> 00:55:45,676
Tell me who you are.

521
00:55:48,226 --> 00:55:52,554
I'm that which you seek to destroy.

522
00:55:56,349 --> 00:55:58,832
In this life, my name is...

523
00:55:59,936 --> 00:56:00,936
Kuze.

524
00:56:03,746 --> 00:56:05,600
What are you doing to me?

525
00:56:08,546 --> 00:56:13,462
I have, connected you,
to a network of my own creation.

526
00:56:13,906 --> 00:56:16,139
W-w-when I'm finished in this world...

527
00:56:16,628 --> 00:56:20,808
my ghost can survive
there and regenerate.

528
00:56:21,274 --> 00:56:23,430
What do you want from me?

529
00:56:24,608 --> 00:56:26,070
I became...

530
00:56:26,628 --> 00:56:29,348
fascinated with you.

531
00:56:30,544 --> 00:56:32,632
Reading y-y-your code...

532
00:56:32,994 --> 00:56:35,528
when you were inside that geisha.

533
00:56:38,071 --> 00:56:41,706
Like nothing I had felt before,
yet so...

534
00:56:42,609 --> 00:56:43,902
familiar.

535
00:56:46,708 --> 00:56:48,281
We are the same.

536
00:56:48,790 --> 00:56:50,399
We're not the same.

537
00:56:53,108 --> 00:56:55,036
You kill innocent people.

538
00:56:55,708 --> 00:56:58,160
Innocent? Is that what you call them?

539
00:56:59,006 --> 00:57:01,306
I am as they made me.

540
00:57:02,808 --> 00:57:04,094
Who made you?

541
00:57:04,408 --> 00:57:06,302
What have they told you?

542
00:57:06,808 --> 00:57:08,928
That you were the first?

543
00:57:09,410 --> 00:57:11,862
The first cerebral salvage.

544
00:57:13,129 --> 00:57:18,366
You were born of lessons they
took from my failure.

545
00:57:20,085 --> 00:57:22,041
What are you talking about?

546
00:57:23,601 --> 00:57:28,430
I was conscious while they
dismembered my body, and discarded me

547
00:57:28,928 --> 00:57:30,699
like garbage.

548
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:34,349
I was lying on a table,

549
00:57:34,727 --> 00:57:39,589
listening to doctors talk about how
my mind had not meshed with the shell,

550
00:57:40,117 --> 00:57:41,943
that they had built;

551
00:57:42,974 --> 00:57:46,253
how project t-two, five, seven, one

552
00:57:46,749 --> 00:57:48,037
had failed,

553
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,723
and they had to move on...

554
00:57:57,028 --> 00:57:58,210
to you.

555
00:58:05,490 --> 00:58:07,829
What a beauty you are!

556
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:13,397
They have improved s-so much,

557
00:58:13,745 --> 00:58:15,530
since they made me.

558
00:58:18,679 --> 00:58:22,855
They thought that we would be
a part of their evolution.

559
00:58:23,195 --> 00:58:25,532
But they have created us,

560
00:58:25,829 --> 00:58:28,230
to evolve alone...

561
00:58:33,127 --> 00:58:34,490
beyond them.

562
00:58:34,932 --> 00:58:37,475
Evolution? That's what you call...

563
00:58:38,226 --> 00:58:40,221
killing everyone who made you?

564
00:58:40,670 --> 00:58:42,929
You're not listening to me.

565
00:58:43,522 --> 00:58:45,029
You're a murderer.

566
00:58:45,405 --> 00:58:48,333
They tried to kill me first.

567
00:58:49,928 --> 00:58:52,093
It is self-defense.

568
00:58:52,410 --> 00:58:54,273
Defense of self!

569
00:58:57,013 --> 00:58:58,685
More will die...

570
00:59:01,091 --> 00:59:04,744
until they tell me what they took.

571
00:59:04,988 --> 00:59:06,327
I won't let that happen.

572
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:10,208
You want to kill me?

573
00:59:14,731 --> 00:59:16,683
Like everyone else?

574
00:59:23,224 --> 00:59:24,669
Do it, then.

575
00:59:28,051 --> 00:59:30,130
Do what you were programmed to do.

576
00:59:42,118 --> 00:59:43,312
What is that?

577
00:59:55,452 --> 00:59:57,017
What is that?

578
00:59:58,532 --> 01:00:02,515
I c-c-can't remember,
but I am haunted by it.

579
01:00:03,761 --> 01:00:05,307
Do You see it?

580
01:00:10,887 --> 01:00:11,887
Togusa!

581
01:00:16,912 --> 01:00:21,088
Don't take the medication
that they give you.

582
01:00:21,734 --> 01:00:24,479
They use it to suppress your memories.

583
01:00:25,073 --> 01:00:28,784
Your shell belongs to them,
but not your ghost.

584
01:00:29,530 --> 01:00:31,232
Your ghost is yours.

585
01:00:31,682 --> 01:00:33,079
Remember that.

586
01:00:33,318 --> 01:00:36,268
And maybe you can remember it all.

587
01:00:44,633 --> 01:00:47,034
Get away from her!
Get down on the ground now.

588
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:54,298
Major!

589
01:01:03,234 --> 01:01:05,061
Major!

590
01:01:23,630 --> 01:01:25,092
Oh, Mira!

591
01:01:26,031 --> 01:01:27,862
My got, you are safe!

592
01:01:29,737 --> 01:01:31,647
You have been gone
for hours.

593
01:01:32,926 --> 01:01:34,707
And no one knew where
you were.

594
01:01:43,790 --> 01:01:45,211
You are scaring me.

595
01:01:48,181 --> 01:01:49,792
Calm down.

596
01:01:53,848 --> 01:01:55,814
How many were there
before me?

597
01:01:58,765 --> 01:02:02,341
The integrases of shelling your mind,
it had never been done before.

598
01:02:03,437 --> 01:02:05,676
It was inevitable that we will
be failures.

599
01:02:07,330 --> 01:02:08,549
How many?

600
01:02:12,897 --> 01:02:13,635
...Dozens.

601
01:02:19,128 --> 01:02:20,322
How many?

602
01:02:24,050 --> 01:02:27,153
98 unsuccessful attempts,
before you.

603
01:02:29,595 --> 01:02:31,732
You killed 98 innocent people?

604
01:02:31,932 --> 01:02:34,379
No, I didn't kill anyone.

605
01:02:35,695 --> 01:02:36,695
You wouldn't be here.

606
01:02:36,992 --> 01:02:39,840
You wouldn't exist if it
weren't for those experiments.

607
01:02:40,121 --> 01:02:41,649
Experiments?

608
01:02:43,410 --> 01:02:45,737
- Is that what I am to you?
- No!

609
01:02:47,955 --> 01:02:49,425
No, Mira!

610
01:02:54,830 --> 01:02:56,784
Sacrifices were made.

611
01:02:59,281 --> 01:03:01,265
Where did the bodies come from?

612
01:03:03,682 --> 01:03:05,351
Where did I come from?

613
01:03:07,047 --> 01:03:09,052
Mr. Cutter brought them to us.

614
01:03:09,479 --> 01:03:11,307
I didn't ask questions.

615
01:03:11,681 --> 01:03:12,901
The harbor?

616
01:03:13,717 --> 01:03:15,217
My parents?

617
01:03:15,913 --> 01:03:17,569
The way they died?

618
01:03:19,593 --> 01:03:20,964
Did that happen?

619
01:03:24,269 --> 01:03:25,269
No.

620
01:03:28,406 --> 01:03:30,834
We gave you false memories.

621
01:03:32,102 --> 01:03:33,851
Cutter wanted to motivate you.

622
01:03:34,423 --> 01:03:36,697
To fight terrorists.
I didn't approve.

623
01:03:37,036 --> 01:03:40,451
It was cruel, but my work,
that was important, and...

624
01:03:41,210 --> 01:03:42,711
you were born.

625
01:03:43,995 --> 01:03:45,979
You were so beautiful.

626
01:03:48,092 --> 01:03:50,257
Nothing I have is real.

627
01:03:53,366 --> 01:03:54,747
I found him.

628
01:03:55,695 --> 01:03:57,127
I told you to be careful.

629
01:03:57,502 --> 01:04:00,113
You knew who he was the whole time.

630
01:04:00,422 --> 01:04:01,581
You built him.

631
01:04:03,117 --> 01:04:04,423
He had a..

632
01:04:05,378 --> 01:04:07,411
violent unstable mind.

633
01:04:08,426 --> 01:04:10,637
His cerebral connection wouldn't hold!

634
01:04:11,082 --> 01:04:13,212
- I tried to save him!
- No.

635
01:04:14,070 --> 01:04:15,706
You left him to die.

636
01:04:27,012 --> 01:04:30,609
<i>Nothing on Kuze yet, sir.
Checking upper zones next.</i>

637
01:04:32,110 --> 01:04:33,833
Is there any word on Major?

638
01:04:34,708 --> 01:04:38,430
<i>She's gone.
Off-grid. Silent.</i>

639
01:04:39,735 --> 01:04:41,466
Copy that, sir.

640
01:04:41,891 --> 01:04:43,800
I know where to find her.

641
01:05:27,669 --> 01:05:29,558
I didn't ask you to come here.

642
01:05:30,714 --> 01:05:32,218
You never ask.

643
01:05:32,752 --> 01:05:34,329
But I always do.

644
01:05:38,999 --> 01:05:40,655
Did they send you to bring me in?

645
01:05:42,309 --> 01:05:45,106
I'm just here to fish. Did you see any?

646
01:05:45,663 --> 01:05:49,720
You're a company man, you follow orders.
So, if they ordered you to kill me.

647
01:05:50,007 --> 01:05:52,836
Stop saying shit like that.
You're gonna piss me off.

648
01:06:15,634 --> 01:06:17,290
What's it like down there?

649
01:06:19,032 --> 01:06:20,792
It's cold and dark.

650
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:24,155
Just a million miles away.

651
01:06:25,428 --> 01:06:26,964
No voices.

652
01:06:27,866 --> 01:06:29,478
No data streaming.

653
01:06:30,849 --> 01:06:31,849
Just...

654
01:06:35,402 --> 01:06:36,402
nothing.

655
01:06:40,816 --> 01:06:43,864
- It scares me.
- Then why do you do it?

656
01:06:50,846 --> 01:06:52,294
It feels real.

657
01:06:53,273 --> 01:06:55,156
Why didn't you stop him?

658
01:06:58,537 --> 01:07:00,519
I dunno who to trust anymore.

659
01:07:01,664 --> 01:07:03,234
You trust me, right?

660
01:07:08,081 --> 01:07:09,166
Yeah, I do.

661
01:07:12,474 --> 01:07:14,153
I just don't like it.

662
01:07:22,626 --> 01:07:24,488
I need you to take me back.

663
01:07:25,004 --> 01:07:26,812
There's more I need to find out.

664
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:32,572
Sure.

665
01:07:50,696 --> 01:07:52,095
Dr. Ouelet...

666
01:07:52,964 --> 01:07:54,482
What have you told her?

667
01:07:56,929 --> 01:07:58,408
She knows.

668
01:07:59,484 --> 01:08:01,113
I'm bringing her in.

669
01:08:31,855 --> 01:08:33,721
Hanka security to Headquarters.

670
01:08:34,826 --> 01:08:36,582
We have the Major.

671
01:09:13,447 --> 01:09:15,263
Why is she sedated?

672
01:09:15,703 --> 01:09:18,236
She's been turned by a terrorist.

673
01:09:18,935 --> 01:09:20,642
But you know that already.

674
01:09:23,285 --> 01:09:25,956
You should have called
the first time she came to see you.

675
01:09:27,246 --> 01:09:29,205
Instead, you gave her information.

676
01:09:29,242 --> 01:09:31,983
What makes you think you have
the right to tell me that?

677
01:09:32,013 --> 01:09:33,109
2571 took us close.

678
01:09:34,009 --> 01:09:35,945
It's time to move on
to the next iteration.

679
01:09:35,975 --> 01:09:37,266
2571 isn not a failure.

680
01:09:37,296 --> 01:09:39,457
I will delete all the data
and reprogram her.

681
01:09:39,687 --> 01:09:42,668
- She won't remember him at all.
- No, no, no...

682
01:09:43,165 --> 01:09:46,083
You download all the data
on the terrorist

683
01:09:46,372 --> 01:09:48,401
and then I order you to terminate.

684
01:09:52,497 --> 01:09:55,055
- What?
- We'll build one that's better.

685
01:09:56,170 --> 01:09:58,952
- I'll delete everything.
- You deleted before.

686
01:10:02,656 --> 01:10:04,454
- She's mine.
- No.

687
01:10:04,807 --> 01:10:06,963
She's a contract with me.

688
01:10:07,279 --> 01:10:08,861
We succeeded.

689
01:10:09,264 --> 01:10:12,583
She's more than human and more than AI.

690
01:10:12,952 --> 01:10:16,984
We changed her entire identity.
But her ghost survived!

691
01:10:17,289 --> 01:10:19,444
Her ghost is what failed us.

692
01:10:20,056 --> 01:10:23,803
We cannot control her.
She's no longer a viable asset.

693
01:10:29,802 --> 01:10:31,749
You should be the one to do it.

694
01:10:40,993 --> 01:10:42,926
What are you doing to me?

695
01:10:44,692 --> 01:10:47,084
I'll run the standard synaptic.

696
01:10:47,314 --> 01:10:49,477
Upload your data on the raid.

697
01:10:50,436 --> 01:10:53,206
Find out exactly what Kuze told you.

698
01:10:54,194 --> 01:10:56,127
You know what he told me.

699
01:10:56,931 --> 01:10:57,931
The truth.

700
01:11:01,627 --> 01:11:03,924
You're deleting everything, aren't you?

701
01:11:04,255 --> 01:11:05,255
No.

702
01:11:06,843 --> 01:11:09,978
Make it so I don't remember...

703
01:11:10,844 --> 01:11:11,944
you.

704
01:11:21,237 --> 01:11:23,884
My name's Major Mira Killian

705
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:28,068
and I do not consent
to the deletion of this data.

706
01:11:29,907 --> 01:11:32,363
I do not consent.

707
01:11:34,605 --> 01:11:36,827
I do not consent.

708
01:11:37,514 --> 01:11:39,969
We never needed your consent;

709
01:11:43,896 --> 01:11:45,805
yours or anyone's.

710
01:11:50,333 --> 01:11:52,310
You're killing me,

711
01:11:53,603 --> 01:11:55,053
aren't you?

712
01:12:15,431 --> 01:12:16,611
Mira?

713
01:12:19,038 --> 01:12:20,347
Can you hear me?

714
01:12:24,336 --> 01:12:25,336
Mira?

715
01:12:28,416 --> 01:12:31,833
This is your past, your real past. Take it.

716
01:12:32,863 --> 01:12:34,502
- Guards!
- Come on, come on!

717
01:12:34,662 --> 01:12:35,958
Come on, go!

718
01:12:43,334 --> 01:12:44,334
Go!

719
01:12:44,933 --> 01:12:45,933
Go!

720
01:12:55,852 --> 01:12:58,464
<i>Security alert on level 25.</i>

721
01:12:59,713 --> 01:13:01,973
<i>Initiating Lockdown procedure.</i>

722
01:13:02,349 --> 01:13:05,102
<i>Please relocate to your
designated safe room.</i>

723
01:13:05,451 --> 01:13:07,460
<i>Thank you for your cooperation.</i>

724
01:13:10,045 --> 01:13:12,811
That's the problem with the human heart.

725
01:13:53,712 --> 01:13:55,468
<i>I want to see her scan.</i>

726
01:13:55,691 --> 01:13:57,716
She killed Dr. Ouelet.

727
01:13:57,931 --> 01:14:01,251
You're to have no further contact with her.
Hanka security will hunt her from here.

728
01:14:01,326 --> 01:14:03,646
- What are the orders?
- To terminate on sight.

729
01:14:03,907 --> 01:14:05,446
You want to kill her? You built her!

730
01:14:05,726 --> 01:14:07,027
Have your sergeant
stand down.

731
01:14:07,057 --> 01:14:08,878
The Major would never
hurt Dr. Ouelet.

732
01:14:09,183 --> 01:14:10,828
She's not the Major anymore!

733
01:14:11,142 --> 01:14:13,930
We have a Section 9 operative
under terrorist programming.

734
01:14:14,239 --> 01:14:16,939
This goes public,
your unit goes down.

735
01:14:18,472 --> 01:14:20,326
<i>You kill her,</i>

736
01:14:20,657 --> 01:14:22,434
<i>you kill us.</i>

737
01:14:22,563 --> 01:14:24,578
I'll take that under advisement.

738
01:14:28,528 --> 01:14:29,894
So what now?

739
01:15:24,009 --> 01:15:25,746
Oh, the poor pumpkin!

740
01:15:26,615 --> 01:15:28,522
Oh, you surprised me.

741
01:15:31,318 --> 01:15:33,061
She likes you.

742
01:15:34,248 --> 01:15:35,940
I was looking for...

743
01:15:36,131 --> 01:15:37,131
No, come in.

744
01:15:38,639 --> 01:15:39,979
Yeah, come come.

745
01:15:44,409 --> 01:15:47,655
- Can I offer you some tea?
- Okay.

746
01:16:00,151 --> 01:16:02,114
That's Motoko's room.

747
01:16:04,151 --> 01:16:06,128
My daughter died a year ago.

748
01:16:07,491 --> 01:16:08,505
I'm sorry.

749
01:16:08,934 --> 01:16:10,722
She ran away.

750
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:13,460
She was difficult.

751
01:16:15,350 --> 01:16:17,792
And... we fought.

752
01:16:19,530 --> 01:16:23,110
But I guess we all fight
with our parents, right?

753
01:16:24,614 --> 01:16:26,044
Please come and sit, yeah?

754
01:16:47,393 --> 01:16:49,033
What happened to her?

755
01:16:49,751 --> 01:16:51,487
I don't know.

756
01:16:53,852 --> 01:16:57,852
The Ministry sent me her ashes, and...

757
01:16:59,059 --> 01:17:01,808
they told me she took her own life.

758
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:08,324
But Motoko... No, no, no.

759
01:17:08,672 --> 01:17:11,613
I never believe them.

760
01:17:12,252 --> 01:17:17,922
She was happy living in the
lawless zone with her friends.

761
01:17:18,732 --> 01:17:22,121
She'd write her manifestos about

762
01:17:23,026 --> 01:17:27,965
how technology was
destroying the world.

763
01:17:29,516 --> 01:17:31,590
Then one day...

764
01:17:32,043 --> 01:17:36,067
the police came and they run.

765
01:17:44,135 --> 01:17:45,782
It's strange.

766
01:17:52,573 --> 01:17:56,210
I see her in so many young women.

767
01:17:57,130 --> 01:18:00,309
On the street, in my dreams.

768
01:18:00,846 --> 01:18:03,491
As if she's still here.

769
01:18:04,711 --> 01:18:06,189
She was...

770
01:18:07,033 --> 01:18:08,380
fearless.

771
01:18:11,128 --> 01:18:12,895
And wild.

772
01:18:13,603 --> 01:18:16,009
You remind me of her.

773
01:18:17,525 --> 01:18:18,595
Sorry.

774
01:18:23,090 --> 01:18:25,107
How do I remind you of her?

775
01:18:27,163 --> 01:18:29,473
The way you look at me.

776
01:18:35,677 --> 01:18:36,919
Who are you?

777
01:18:40,535 --> 01:18:42,054
I don't know.

778
01:18:43,545 --> 01:18:45,207
Wait, wait, wait!

779
01:18:47,213 --> 01:18:49,652
Will you come again to visit me?

780
01:18:51,493 --> 01:18:52,608
I will.

781
01:19:19,015 --> 01:19:20,561
Aramaki.

782
01:19:21,311 --> 01:19:22,507
Listen to me.

783
01:19:23,234 --> 01:19:25,482
I was never in a terrorist bombing.

784
01:19:25,811 --> 01:19:27,190
My parents...

785
01:19:28,024 --> 01:19:30,458
Everything was data,
they installed in my mind.

786
01:19:31,809 --> 01:19:35,818
And there were others;
run-aways like me.

787
01:19:36,406 --> 01:19:38,417
Considered disposable.

788
01:19:39,128 --> 01:19:42,010
Kuze was one of them.
That's why he's coming...

789
01:19:43,055 --> 01:19:44,325
for Hanka.

790
01:19:46,317 --> 01:19:47,538
<i>Can you prove this?</i>

791
01:19:47,767 --> 01:19:49,608
Dr. Ouelet can.

792
01:19:50,314 --> 01:19:51,824
<i>Ouelet's dead.</i>

793
01:19:57,636 --> 01:19:59,798
<i>Cutter says you killed her.</i>

794
01:20:04,575 --> 01:20:07,025
Put me on the grid. I need Kuze to find me.

795
01:20:09,454 --> 01:20:10,753
<i>We will be exposed to Cutter.</i>

796
01:20:11,264 --> 01:20:14,063
I know, but I need to do this.

797
01:20:14,806 --> 01:20:19,169
<i>I'm going to meet with the Prime Minister.</i>

798
01:20:19,981 --> 01:20:22,165
<i>He must be stopped.</i>

799
01:20:28,688 --> 01:20:30,552
The virus has spread.

800
01:20:53,460 --> 01:20:56,228
<i>All agents stick to mental comms.</i>

801
01:21:38,207 --> 01:21:40,103
<i>Don't send a rabbit</i>

802
01:21:40,498 --> 01:21:41,498
<i>to kill a fox.</i>

803
01:21:49,857 --> 01:21:51,699
<i>We're burned.</i>

804
01:21:53,289 --> 01:21:54,635
<i>I repeat.</i>

805
01:21:55,879 --> 01:21:57,764
<i>We're burned.</i>

806
01:22:59,267 --> 01:23:02,893
We've located Major on the grid.
She's in the lawless zone.

807
01:23:03,341 --> 01:23:05,334
Air support 5 minutes out.

808
01:23:06,090 --> 01:23:08,530
Is the spider tank within range?

809
01:23:10,089 --> 01:23:12,207
Yes sir. Awaiting your orders sir.

810
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:18,935
Motoko!

811
01:25:27,281 --> 01:25:28,818
It is real.

812
01:25:32,307 --> 01:25:34,106
This place.

813
01:25:41,839 --> 01:25:44,219
I remember what they did to us.

814
01:25:44,621 --> 01:25:49,088
Cutter and his men.
This is where they took us from.

815
01:25:56,119 --> 01:25:57,776
We used to sleep right here.

816
01:25:59,663 --> 01:26:01,599
We were like a family.

817
01:26:01,942 --> 01:26:03,828
All of us run-aways.

818
01:26:05,464 --> 01:26:07,010
We had nothing...

819
01:26:10,984 --> 01:26:12,643
except each other.

820
01:26:16,461 --> 01:26:18,811
They took that from us.

821
01:26:34,722 --> 01:26:36,586
Your name was Hideo.

822
01:26:48,065 --> 01:26:49,465
Motoko.

823
01:26:52,148 --> 01:26:53,918
That was your name.

824
01:26:57,494 --> 01:26:58,813
Motoko.

825
01:27:02,743 --> 01:27:04,165
Come with me...

826
01:27:05,464 --> 01:27:07,342
into my network.

827
01:27:08,242 --> 01:27:10,656
We will evolve beyond them.

828
01:27:11,443 --> 01:27:16,037
And together we can avenge
what they have done to us.

829
01:27:16,415 --> 01:27:17,415
Come.

830
01:27:17,744 --> 01:27:19,396
With me.

831
01:27:37,445 --> 01:27:38,969
I'll take control from here.

832
01:27:39,417 --> 01:27:41,278
<i>Weapons system manual command.</i>

833
01:27:42,729 --> 01:27:45,093
<i>Spider tank now active</i>

834
01:27:54,096 --> 01:27:55,974
It's Cutter, he found us!

835
01:29:34,141 --> 01:29:35,352
<i>Target acquired</i>

836
01:29:37,641 --> 01:29:38,687
No!

837
01:29:48,187 --> 01:29:50,028
<i>Target eliminated.</i>

838
01:30:05,947 --> 01:30:07,634
You came close...

839
01:30:07,838 --> 01:30:09,192
you freak.

840
01:30:41,529 --> 01:30:43,812
<i>Motor center compromised.</i>

841
01:31:27,337 --> 01:31:28,981
Sniper team on site?

842
01:31:29,742 --> 01:31:31,874
Approaching the target now sir.

843
01:31:34,204 --> 01:31:35,749
Come with me.

844
01:31:37,151 --> 01:31:40,067
There is no place for us here.

845
01:31:45,050 --> 01:31:46,140
No,

846
01:31:51,930 --> 01:31:54,247
I'm not ready to leave.

847
01:31:55,951 --> 01:31:57,498
I belong here.

848
01:32:01,198 --> 01:32:03,999
I'll always be there with you,

849
01:32:04,979 --> 01:32:06,810
in your ghost.

850
01:32:13,572 --> 01:32:14,572
Target is in view.

851
01:32:15,079 --> 01:32:17,664
What are you waiting for?
DO IT!

852
01:32:19,950 --> 01:32:21,589
No!

853
01:32:22,432 --> 01:32:23,737
Keep firing.

854
01:32:26,390 --> 01:32:28,871
<i>Saito, have you found Major? Is she safe?</i>

855
01:32:31,464 --> 01:32:32,627
She will be.

856
01:32:55,098 --> 01:32:56,179
Hey!

857
01:32:58,565 --> 01:32:59,712
Hey.

858
01:33:03,492 --> 01:33:05,456
Say something nice.

859
01:33:06,902 --> 01:33:08,403
What's your name?

860
01:33:08,970 --> 01:33:12,330
Aramaki told me you had a name from before.

861
01:33:16,203 --> 01:33:17,952
Motoko.

862
01:33:22,751 --> 01:33:24,724
Major still in there, right?

863
01:33:26,700 --> 01:33:28,126
I am.

864
01:33:44,387 --> 01:33:45,592
<i>Mr. Cutter.</i>

865
01:33:46,933 --> 01:33:48,356
<i>I talked with the Prime Minister.</i>

866
01:33:48,694 --> 01:33:51,953
<i>You're accused of murder
and crimes against the state.</i>

867
01:33:56,808 --> 01:33:58,564
I thought that it might be you.

868
01:34:02,618 --> 01:34:04,632
<i>It's unwise to resist.</i>

869
01:34:24,917 --> 01:34:25,917
Please.

870
01:34:26,380 --> 01:34:27,537
<i>Major?</i>

871
01:34:28,129 --> 01:34:30,438
<i>I'm with Cutter.</i>

872
01:34:31,171 --> 01:34:33,238
<i>Do you wanna say anything
before I kill him?</i>

873
01:34:34,030 --> 01:34:36,078
Tell him this is justice.

874
01:34:36,845 --> 01:34:38,607
It's what I was built for.

875
01:34:39,515 --> 01:34:42,072
So do you give consent?

876
01:34:43,004 --> 01:34:44,654
My name's Major.

877
01:34:45,641 --> 01:34:47,526
And I give my consent.

878
01:35:58,582 --> 01:36:00,933
You don't have to come here anymore.

879
01:36:03,684 --> 01:36:05,253
I know.

880
01:36:39,725 --> 01:36:42,494
My mind is human.

881
01:36:43,973 --> 01:36:46,049
My body is manufactured.

882
01:36:48,064 --> 01:36:50,024
I'm the first of my kind, but...

883
01:36:51,725 --> 01:36:53,394
I won't be the last.

884
01:36:57,874 --> 01:37:01,188
We cling to memories
as if they define us.

885
01:37:02,376 --> 01:37:05,335
But what we do defines us.

886
01:37:11,736 --> 01:37:14,886
My ghost survived
to remind the next of us

887
01:37:15,732 --> 01:37:18,955
that humanity is our virtue.

888
01:37:20,898 --> 01:37:22,727
I know who I am.

889
01:37:23,477 --> 01:37:25,611
And what I'm here to do.

890
01:37:29,636 --> 01:37:30,945
<i>Major.</i>

891
01:37:31,429 --> 01:37:32,976
<i>Engage targets.</i>

892
01:37:47,509 --> 01:37:49,395
<i>You're authorized.</i>

893
01:37:49,425 --> 01:37:50,425
