00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,530
It's ok, just breathe.

9
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,190
Just breathe.

10
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,080
Breathe.

11
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,360
Good.

12
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,280
That's good.

13
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,010
Hello Mira.

14
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,470
I'm Dr. Ouelet.

15
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,750
Do you remember anything
about the attack?

16
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,530
What happened?

17
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,610
I was...
You were drowning.

18
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,400
There was water.

19
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,520
That's right. You were on a boat,

20
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,070
a refugee boat.

21
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,430
It was sunk by terrorists.

22
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,620
Why can't I feel my body?

23
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,930
Mira, your body was damaged.
We could not save that.

24
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:41,500
Only your brain survived.

25
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,100
We made you a new body.

26
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,380
A synthetic shell.

27
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,960
But your mind, your soul...

28
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,650
Your ghost.

29
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,630
It's still in there.

30
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,420
Please.

31
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,880
Sedate her.

32
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,480
Will it work?

33
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,600
Absolutely.

34
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,080
She's a miracle.

35
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:26,070
A machine can't lead,
It can only follow orders.

36
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:29,220
A machine can't imagine or care or intuit.

37
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,850
But as a human mind in
a cybernetic frame...

38
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,580
Mira can do all those things, and more.

39
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,720
The first of her kind.

40
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,940
She will join Section 9
as soon as she is operational.

41
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:45,370
Please don't do that.

42
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:48,970
You reducing a complex human to a machine.

43
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,470
I don't think of her as a machine.

44
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,430
She is a weapon.

45
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,390
And the future of my company.

But I embrace change...

63
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,760
and enhancement.

64
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,700
Now there is nothing I can't do.

65
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,660
Nothing I can't know, nothing I can't be.

66
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,650
Wait and listen to something.

67
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,580
It's my 4 year old daughter.

to sing that lullaby

69
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,810

There is an echo box up here.

72
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,460
Someone is scanning data traffic.

73
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,020
<i>Keeps track of where it is transmitted.</i>

74
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,300
To see who's worth
this kind of surveillance.

75
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,970
Accessing hotel security network.

76
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:23,850
What're you seeing, sir?
I've got a lot of hotel to scan.

77
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:30,570
<i>There is a banquet room reserved for

79
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,860
Got it. 43rd floor.

80
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:44,260
Someone contacted the president staff.
Someone is watching him.

81
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,300
Dr. Osmond...

82
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,190
What is it you want from us?

83
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,400
I think it is more about what
Hanka Robotics can do for you.

84
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:56,170
73% of this world has woken up
to the age of cyber enhancement.

00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:03,020
My people embrace cyber enhancement
as do I.

87
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,120
There is no one who really
understand the risk...

88
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:10,550

- Too long.

00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:44,890
I had heard this speech before
from your competitors.

97
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,620
And now Hanka Robotics
serves it with Milky suck.

98

<i>Hey.. hey..</i>

99
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,720

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,410
You're not the same.

110
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:33,780

111
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:36,060

<i>DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE,

114
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,640
So what do we have on Osmond?

115
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,510
So far, very little.

116
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,070
He was the head of Hanka's
robotics division.

117
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,700
Human, but of course cyber enhanced.

118
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,500
So how did they hack him?

119
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,370
Somehow this geisha bot
got past his encryption.

120
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,150
Something is different.

121
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,640
What'd you get?

122
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:43,000
Why you always thinking
he's out there enhancing.

123
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,830
Because he is.

124
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:46,700
A cyber mech liver.

125
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,630
Been saving up for a while.

126
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:50,390
Now it's last call every night.

127
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,890
You got enhanced
so you can drink more?

128
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:57,440
Embrace enhancements, Togusa.
We would not be here without it.

129
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,240
I am all human and happy, thanks.

130
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:04,060
Any more information
about the seized geisha bot?

131
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,720
Hanka is running scans.

132
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:08,210
Dr. Dahlin will have the
reports ready but...

133
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,180
<i>I've been talking to the Prime Minister.</i>

134
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,050

135
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,010
<i>Togusa.</i>

136
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,210
Following last night's attack...

137
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:28,380
3 more Hanka's scientists were murdered...

138
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:30,450
at the company's central laboratory.

139
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,380
The first two were shot...

140
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:37,220
and the third was beaten to death
by his own service robot.

141
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,310
All showed signs of cerebral hacking.

142
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:44,100
The same as the geisha did to Osmond.

143
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:48,620
And all were senior figures... in Hanka.

144
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,300
Just like Osmond.

145
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:54,670
A message was left
at each of the crime scene...

146
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,070
By someone identifying himself...

147
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,640
as <i>Kuze.</i>

148
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:05,070
<i>Collaborate with Hanka Robotics

<i>Togusa.</i>

152
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:19,120
<i>You and Ladriya go speak to Mr. Cutter,

153
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:24,030
<i>Major and Batou

154
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:28,480
<i>Find out what has been
recovered from the geisha.</i>

155
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,300
<i>Major!</i>

156
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,980
<i>I told you not jump off.</i>

157
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,870
I had to, or more would have died.

158
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:55,560
<i>You are a member of my team,
and my responsibility</i>

159
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:59,490
I'll find him... and I will kill him.

160
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:03,330
It's what I am built for, isn't it?

161
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:12,180
<i>You are more than just a weapon.</i>

162
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:16,060
<i>You have a soul, a ghost.</i>

163
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:21,240
<i>When we see our uniqueness as a virtue...</i>

164
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,330
<i>Only then will we find peace.</i>

165
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:32,160
<i>Safely reconfiguring the

166
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,780
<i>Families built better.</i>

167
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,270
What was going on with you
at the hotel last night?

168
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,730
Nothing. I'm fine.

169
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,150
You sure?

170
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:43,730
<i>- Hey, sweetheart, want an upgrade?
- Move.</i>

171
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,930
<i>- I have anything you want.
- Back off!</i>

172
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:50,210
Hey, Ming!

173
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:51,330
Hey, Batou!

174
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,930
- Got your bones.
- Thanks man.

175
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,970
For the dogs.

176
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:02,950
For someone who doesn't like people
How come you care about dogs so much?

177
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,820
I dont know. I like just strays
and they like me.

178
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,880
They like you because you feed them.

179
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,180
You got no heart.

180
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,080
Hey, girls!

181
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,000
Hey Gabriel!

182
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,440
Meet Major.

183
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,330
Major, Gabriel.

184
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,200
We used to have a dog.

185
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,690
Seriously?

186
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:37,310
I had you down as more of a cat person.

187
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,980
You don't talk about that stuff.

188
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,260
What?

189
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,230
- Your past.
- I don't remember much.

190
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,200
Just fragments, bits and pieces.

191
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:53,570
What about family?

192
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:56,210
My parents, they died
bringing us to this country.

193
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:57,960
Our boat sank in the harbor.

194
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:00,200
I almost drowned.

195
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,380
I feel it's like...

196
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:05,870
there is always this thick fog
over my memory.

197
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,370
And I can't seen through it.

198
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:09,770
You are lucky.

199
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,690
Every single day I get
screwed upon my memory.

200
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,380
It's better to be pure.

201
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:16,300
Like you.

202
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,790
<i>HANKA CENTRAL OFFICE OF ROBOTICS</i>

203
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,100

206
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,470
Your have damaged internal systems.

207
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:55,110
Maybe next time you can design me better.

208
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,090
- How are you?
- I am fine. I can't feel anything.

209
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:04,030
No you, in There.

210
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,600
I have been having glitches...

211
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:09,810
It will pass.

212
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,840
- Have you been taking your medication?
- Yeah.

213
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:16,430
But these ones are so cycling.
I had two this morning.

214
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:19,120
- Sound or image?
- Both.

215
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,450
I see it.

216
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,570
You made any unencrypted downloads?

217
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,110
- No. Just delete them from me.
- Consent?

218
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:34,240
My name is Major Mary Killian.
I give my consent to delete this data.

219
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,810
It's done.

220
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,760
- No big deal.
- What are they?

221
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:42,220
Sensory echoes from your mind, shadows.

222
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,570
I'm not sure.

223
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,600
How do you know what's a glitch
and what's me?

224
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:48,620
The glitches have a different texture...

225
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,890
to the rest of your code.

226
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,700
I can see everything.

227
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:59,390
All of your thoughts, your... decisions.

228
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:01,710
I guess privacy is just for humans.

229
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,630
You are human.

230
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,760
People see you as human.

231
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:09,300
Everyone around me seems to fit.

232
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:13,110
They seem connected to something.
Something I...

233
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:14,850
am not..

234
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:19,440
- Like I have no past.
- Of course you have a past.

235
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:23,140
And at time you'll feel more more
connected to it and to them.

236
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,770
Opens and close, please.

237
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,920
We cling to memories
as if they define us, but...

238
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,780
They really don't.

239
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,560
What we do is what defines us.

240
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:54,170
<i>You're entering a Hanka secure area.

241

<i>Please disable communication enhancement.</i>

242
00:23:59,090 --> 00:23:59,750
I'm busy.

243
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,370
Dr.. Dahlin! Are you finished yet?

244
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:04,790
If you hadn't riddled the Geisha
with bullets,

245
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:05,900
This would be much easier.

246
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,510
- I didn't shoot him.
- I did.

247
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:11,740
This is gonna take days.

248
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,660
I need to run hundreds
of potential simulations.

249
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,020
We don't have the time.

250
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:22,290
She was a Hanka companion bot.

251
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,860
But she was reprogrammed
for cerebral hacking.

252
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,660
What was on her drives?

253
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:33,660
Nothing. The data was destroyed
as it was transmitted.

254
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,730
No sign of what she was up to.

255
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,280
The hardware was vandalized.

256
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,650
They ripped her up.

257
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:42,940
Then I have to do a deep dive.

258
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,920
You can't encrypt during a deep dive

259
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:47,560
I know it.

260
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:53,440
They could left traps in her.
Mag pulses, viruses.

261
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:54,880
She is right.

262
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:59,690
You will be exposing your mind to
who ever hacked her. You'll be wide open.

263
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:07,210
I have to get inside her memory.
It's the fastest way to find Kuze.

264
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,610
It's too dangerous.

265
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,300
And highly irresponsible.

266
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,600
Are you sure?

267
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,270
You see any bad code headed my way,
pull me out.

268
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,010
How come you're the one sweating?

269
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,250
Run it.

270
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:53,220
Cyber mind connection to the Major,
now active...

271
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:55,230
and unencrypted

272
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,850
consent required for data download.

273
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:02,270
My name is Major Mira Killian
and I give my consent.

274
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,370
Disconnect. Get her out.

275
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:47,850
- Get her out!
- I'm trying, but she's being hacked.

276
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:53,150
Get her out now!

277
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,410
Now!

278
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,570
Are you okay?

279
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,110
I know where he is.

280
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,690
I know this place.

281
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,670
They run black market mech,

282
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:25,870
- You tooled up..?
- Yep.

283
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:28,110
Target's in the basement,
I'll lead.

284
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:29,570
Switching in my comms.

285
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:33,240
- Hope you've been practicing.
- That's unfair.

286
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,680
Just takes me a moment to,

287
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:38,360
Get the hang of it.

288
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,890
Two mercs at the doors.
Armed and enhanced.

289
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,710
Copy that. We got it covered.

290
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,340
There's a lot of heat in here
for a nightclub.

291
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:10,810
It's a Yakuza club. What did you expect?

292
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:12,610
I quite like the place.

293
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,890
Why doesn't that surprise me?

294
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:19,760
I am gonna have to draw some attention.
See if I can access the basement that way.

295
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:25,850
You're not here
looking for any trouble, are you?

296
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:28,940
I am just here for the girls... and beer.

297
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,820
- Can I help you?
- I am looking for someone.

298
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:36,360
You've been here before?

299
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:38,980
My friend had some mech work done here.
Industry stuff.

300
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:40,890
We don't do mech work here.

301
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:42,950
My mistake.

302
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,890
Why don't you come have fun with us?
We will have some privacy.

303
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,120
I'm in.

304
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,300
I'll be here when you need me.

305
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:14,980
- You say your friend worked here?
- I said my friend had work done here.

306
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,450
She's human?

307
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,470
Your friend.

308
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:22,020
Now what's that supposed to mean?

309
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,350
Batou.

310
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,800
Can you hear me?

311
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,840
Who did this stunning work on you?

312
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,880
It is divine.

313
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:39,110
Ladriya... guns.

314
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,360
Here.

315
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:46,050
Batou, I'm losing signal.

316
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,350
Don't worry sweety.

317
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,830
We have privacy.

318
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,640
Listen.

319
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,400
No signal is going in or out.

320
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:00,030
Major, I'm in position. Do you copy?

321
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,240
Beer.

322
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:06,450
If you don't answer,
you're gonna hurt my feelings.

323
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:16,640
Ladriya, do you have major on Comms?

324
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,440
Got nothing. The signal is still blocked.

325
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,670
I am afraid I get bored
rather easily, so...

326
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,940
You don't wanna talk...

327
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,900
Maybe you wanna dance!

328
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,340
Major, come on. Answer me.

329
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:51,250
I thought you said no trouble.

330
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,350
Dance!

331
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,200
The truth is...

332
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:04,490
I wasn't built to dance.

333
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:01,420
Back on comms.
I am heading to the back room.

334
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,390
I missed you. I'll meet you there.

335
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:40,090
<i>Collaborate with Hanka Robotics
and be destroyed.</i>

336
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:51,890
Major?

337
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,390
Where is Batou?

338
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:30,210
In enhancement, next door.
He is doing well

339
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:34,270
you took most of the blast.

340
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,150
I saw him down there.

341
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:42,320
It was like...

342
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,880
He waited to see me.

343
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,520
We synaptic scanned you.

344
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:52,160
Everything you witnessed
went to Section 9 to evaluate.

345
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,730
You know, the scan...

346
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,320
Also turned up the number of glitches.

347
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,050
They've been getting worse.

348
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,180
Since when?

349
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,770
Since the deep dive.

350
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:27,030
Do any of the glitches
mean something to you?

351
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,550
No.

352
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,720
They don't.

353
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:36,740
You have been inside
the same shell as he has.

354
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:41,270
That could have very serious consequences.

355
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,430
You were not authorized
to deep dive the geisha.

356
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,290
You're disappointed.

357
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:51,520
No, I'm worried.

358
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,850
You're not invulnerable.

359
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,400
I can repair your body,
but I can't protect your mind.

360
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,500
Why not?

361
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,250
You can see all my thoughts so...

362
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,700
You should be able to secure them.

363
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:15,110
Try and understand your importance Mira.

364
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:21,090
You're what everyone will become one day.

365
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,620
You don't know how alone
that makes me feel.

366
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,350
I can see you out there, you know.

367
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:51,040
How many fingers am I holding up?

368
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:53,330
Funny.

369
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:04,440
Say something nice.

370
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,540
You chose those?

371
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,470
They are tactical.

372
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,540
- Always for the job.
- What else I got?

373
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,040
- They suit you.
- Yeah?

374
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,870
I got night vision,...

375
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,170
and X-rays.

376
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:24,000
I guess I see like you now.

377
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,130
Don't worry, you'll get used to it.

378
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:31,400
Thanks for saving my ass.

379
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,270
Glad to see you're okay..

380
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,620
Major?

381
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:39,930
Could you feed the dogs for me?

382
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,020
I don't wanna scare them.

383
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,620
Anytime.

384
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:31,560
Are you insufficiently funded, Mr. Aramaki?

385
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:35,450
Is section 9 missing some
critical operational resource?

386
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,650
<i>We have everything that we require.</i>

387
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:43,200
Major is our most sophisticated weapon
only if she is intact.

388
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:46,570
And Dr. Ouelet informed me...

389
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:49,720
That you let her dive a corrupted geisha.

390
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,200
You realize there is a premium importance

391
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,050
that Hanka represents to this government.

392
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:05,760
Major is the is the future of my company.

393
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:09,160
If you compromise your systems again...

394
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:11,780
I will burn this section.

395
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:16,650
<i>Yes sir.</i>

396
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,010
<i>Mr. Cutter.</i>

397
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,700
<i>Be careful who is the threat.</i>

398
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,860
<i>I am accountable to the Prime Minister,
not to Hanka.</i>

399
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,630

Beauty enhanced.</i>

400
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:28,900
Are you human?

401
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:31,490
Yeah.

402
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,000
Can you take that off?

403
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:41,680
So I can see your face?

404
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:08,970
What does that feel like?

405
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,360
It feels...

406
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,220
different.

407
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:25,290
What are you?

408
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:43,940

409
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:54,650
<i>HANKA PERSONNEL FILES</i>

410
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:03,350
Look at me.

411
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:08,660
Tell me what they took from me.

412
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:13,760
I am sorry. They never told us.

413
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:38,750
It feels weird driving with these eyes.

414
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:43,900
Why do you take that?

415
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,200
Um, keeps my brain from rejecting this body.

416
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:51,550
Major, Batou, you need to get here.

417
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:52,890
What you got?

418
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:55,520
Another Hanka scientist
has been found dead.

419
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,090
It's Dahlin.

420
00:42:57,610 --> 00:42:58,610
Got it.

421
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:07,420
Major this way.

422
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:36,930
<i>SECURE - PROJECT 2571</i>

423
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:38,590
What is that?

424
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,360
She found what Kuze stole from Osmond.

425
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:47,920
It's a list of everyone
who worked on a project called 2571.

426
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:49,920
That's who he's targeting.

427
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,220
Is there anyone else on that list?

428
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:54,830
<i>Dr. OUELET</i>

00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:57,430
Find Oulet. Now!

430
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:00,600
She is in transit. Her comms are down.

431
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:07,310
<i>I'm looking at her and I'm thinking...</i>

432
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:09,770
<i>"You want me to for pay for violin too".</i>

433
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,350
<i>Don't get me wrong.</i>

434
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:14,030
<i>I love that kid to pieces.</i>

435
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:16,220
<i>I do. She is amazing.</i>

436
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:19,450
<i>But when she practices that thing,
it's painful right?</i>

437
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:21,530
<i>Why not piano?</i>

438
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:26,330
<i>I mean, it's the same price, you know.
And doesn't sound so bad.</i>

439
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:31,030
<i>At least if you can't play that proper,
it sounds...</i>

<i>2-5-7-1!

<i>Are you prepare

442
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:47,070
Go!

443
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:03,130
Go!

444
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,040
Who is Kuze?

445
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:04,790
- Why does he want to kill Ouelet?
- I don't know anything.

446
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:09,510
Enough, enough!

447
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:13,120
We need him alive.

448
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:19,590
Please. I have been trough this.

449
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:22,760
You have the wrong guy.

450
00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:26,300
So tell us who we do have.

451
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:31,080
My name is Lee Cunningham.

452
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:36,760
- Where'd you get the weapons?
- I don't know.

453
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:37,670
Who loaded the mines?

454
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:40,180
I don't know anything about the weapons,
alright I told you.

455
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:42,870
I was picking up my daughter.
She takes violin lessons.

456
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:44,540
What's her name?

457
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:49,640
- Is this her?
- Yeah.

458
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:52,280
Isn't she a little angel?

459
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:54,520
- This is your daughter?
- Right.

460
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,740
Do you have that?

461
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:03,560
Where do you live?

462
00:49:05,850 --> 00:49:07,160
I can't remember.

463
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:10,460
I think it's a tall place.
Is it a tall building?

464
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:12,560
It's a tall place, right?

465
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:15,470
You don't have a child.

466
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:21,650
You have no wife. You live alone,
It's just you.

467
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:23,400
- What? No.
- We went to your apartment.

468
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,830
- There was nobody there.
- No.

469
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:26,450
You live there for
10 years by yourself.

470
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:26,720
No.

471
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:29,120
- You're just lying.
- I'm not lying.

472
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:31,790
I didn't kill anyone!

473
00:49:32,030 --> 00:49:34,310
- Why do you keep doing this to me?
- Holocube disconnect.

474
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:35,740
Please!

475
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:38,450
I didn't do anything.

476
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:41,290
Why do you keep saying this to me?

477
00:49:41,490 --> 00:49:43,340
I don't understand.
How can he not know?

478
00:49:43,790 --> 00:49:47,420
The hack must have created a vacuum.
Kuze's wiped his memory...

479
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:50,350
and somehow installed a new reality.

480
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:54,140
At least he got to believe he had a kid.

481
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:56,910
What's the difference huh?

482
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:00,410
Fantasy, reality?

483
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:02,590
Dreams, memories?

484
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:05,220
It's all the same.

485
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:07,580
Just noise.

486
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:10,580
It's him.

487
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:15,110
He is in there.

488
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,340
This cube is secure.
He can't be, Major.

489
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:22,060
Lie Detector.

490
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:23,270
He must have hacked in that way.

491
00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:26,280
We should uplink to the machine,
trace the code, get a lock on his location.

492
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,660
Do it.

493
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:30,130
Don't go in there.
It's too dangerous.

494
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:32,260
<i>Major</i>

495
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:35,180
<i>We don't know what else he can do.</i>

496
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:49,490
The signal is unstable.
Can you get the lock on him?

497
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:51,860
We gotta move fast. We're losing him.

498
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:53,280
Connecting.

499
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:57,230
Who are you?

500
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:01,530
Come here.

501
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:05,230
I'm shy.

502
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:08,570
I'm not beautiful...

503
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:10,080
like you.

504
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:15,080
Tell me who you are.

505
00:51:15,390 --> 00:51:18,300
I have been born more than once.

506
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:21,570
So I have more than one name

507
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:23,620
I'll find you.

508
00:51:24,110 --> 00:51:25,560
Not yet.

509
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:27,740
I am not done.

510
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:30,120
The machine is tracing his location.

511
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:31,700
We got a fix!

512
00:51:37,530 --> 00:51:39,000
I need to see her.

513
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:41,040
No Please. I know..what...

514
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:42,490
We got him.

515
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:51,810
Let's go.

516
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:07,520
Weapons up.

517
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:11,740
- Go.
- On me.

518
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:01,650
Stay Down! Stay Down!

519
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:13,350
Put it down, put it down.

520
00:53:20,970 --> 00:53:21,970
Grenade!

521
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:19,860
Major!

522
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:21,670
Come in.

523
00:54:22,910 --> 00:54:24,930
I know why we could not find him.

524
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:31,010
He is using human minds
to create a network of his own.

525
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:32,650
We're coming to your position.

526
00:55:47,890 --> 00:55:49,720
Tell me who you are.

527
00:55:52,270 --> 00:55:56,590
I'm that what you seek to destroy.

528
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:02,870
In this life, my name is...

529
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:04,980
Kuze.

530
00:56:07,790 --> 00:56:09,640
What are you doing to me?

531
00:56:12,590 --> 00:56:17,500
I have, connected you,
to a network of my own creation.

532
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:20,180
When I am finished in this world...

533
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:24,850
my ghost can survive
there and regenerate.

534
00:56:25,310 --> 00:56:27,470
What do you want from me?

535
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:30,110
I became...

536
00:56:30,670 --> 00:56:33,390
Fascinated with you...

537
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:36,670
Reading your code...

538
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:39,570
when you were inside that geisha.

539
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:45,750
Like nothing I had felt before,
yet so..

540
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:47,940
Familiar.

541
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:52,320
We are the same.

542
00:56:52,830 --> 00:56:54,440
We are not the same.

543
00:56:57,150 --> 00:56:59,080
You kill innocent people.

544
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:02,200
Innocent? Is that the..what you call them?

545
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:05,350
I am as they need me.

546
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:07,910
Who made you?

547
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:10,120
What have they told you?

548
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:12,750
That you were the first?

549
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:15,680
The first cerebral salvage.

550
00:57:16,950 --> 00:57:20,300
You were born of lessons...
they took.

551
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:22,190
from my failure.

552
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:25,860
What are you talking about?

553
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:32,250
I was conscious while they
dismembered my body, and discarded me

554
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:34,520
like garbage.

555
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:38,170
I was lying on a table...

556
00:57:38,550 --> 00:57:43,410
Listening to doctors talk about how
my mind had not meshed with the shell.

557
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:45,760
That they had built.

558
00:57:46,790 --> 00:57:50,070
how project t-two, five, seven, one..

559
00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:51,860
had failed...

560
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:54,540
and they had to move on...

561
00:58:00,850 --> 00:58:02,030
to you.

562
00:58:09,310 --> 00:58:11,650
What a beauty you are.

563
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:17,220
They have improved us so much...

564
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:19,350
since they made me.

565
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:26,670
They thought that we would be
a part of their evolution.

566
00:58:26,810 --> 00:58:29,350
But they have created us...

567
00:58:29,650 --> 00:58:32,050
to evolve alone...

568
00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:38,310
beyond them.

569
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:41,290
Evolution? That's what you call?

570
00:58:42,050 --> 00:58:44,040
Killing everyone who made you?

571
00:58:44,490 --> 00:58:46,750
You are not listening to me.

572
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:48,850
You are murderer.

573
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:52,150
They tried to kill me first.

574
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:55,910
It is self-defense.

575
00:58:56,230 --> 00:58:58,090
The defense of self.

576
00:59:00,830 --> 00:59:02,500
More will die...

577
00:59:04,910 --> 00:59:06,550
until they tell me...

578
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:08,560
what they took.

579
00:59:08,810 --> 00:59:10,150
I won't let that happen.

580
00:59:12,490 --> 00:59:14,030
You want to kill me?

581
00:59:18,550 --> 00:59:20,500
Like everyone else.

582
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,490
Do it, then.

583
00:59:31,870 --> 00:59:33,950
Do what you were programmed to do.

584
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:47,130
What is that?

585
00:59:59,270 --> 01:00:00,840
What is that?

586
01:00:02,350 --> 01:00:06,330
I c-c-can't remember,
but I am haunted by it.

587
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:09,130
Do You see it?

588
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:15,710
Togusa!

589
01:00:20,730 --> 01:00:24,910
Don't take the medication
that they gave you..

590
01:00:25,550 --> 01:00:28,300
They use it to suppress your memories.

591
01:00:28,890 --> 01:00:32,600
Your shell belongs to them,
but not your ghost.

592
01:00:33,350 --> 01:00:35,050
Your ghost is yours.

593
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:37,100
Remember that...

594
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:40,290
and maybe you can remember it all.

595
01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:51,050
Get away from her!
Get down on the ground now.

596
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:58,320
Major..

597
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:09,080
Major!

598
01:02:11,090 --> 01:02:12,400
How many?

599
01:02:16,290 --> 01:02:17,610
Dozens.

600
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:24,680
How manyï?

601
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:31,000
98 unsuccessful attempts before you.

602
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,580
You killed 98 innocent people.

603
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:38,230
No, I didn't kill anyone.

604
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:40,540
You wouldn't be here.

605
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,690
You would not exist if it
weren't for those experiments.

606
01:02:43,970 --> 01:02:45,500
Experiments?

607
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:49,590
- Is that what I am to you?
- No!

608
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:53,270
No, Mira!

609
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:00,630
Sacrifices were made.

610
01:03:03,130 --> 01:03:05,110
Where did the bodies come from?

611
01:03:07,530 --> 01:03:09,200
Where did I come from?

612
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:12,900
Mr. Cutter brought them to us.

613
01:03:13,330 --> 01:03:15,160
I did not ask questions.

614
01:03:15,530 --> 01:03:16,750
The harbor.

615
01:03:17,570 --> 01:03:19,070
My parents.

616
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:21,420
The way they died.

617
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:24,810
Did that happen?

618
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:29,120
No.

619
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:34,680
We gave you false memories.

620
01:03:35,950 --> 01:03:37,700
Cutter wanted to motivate you.

621
01:03:38,270 --> 01:03:40,550
To fight terrorists.
I didn't approve.

622
01:03:40,890 --> 01:03:44,300
It was cruel, but my work,
that was important, and...

623
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:46,560
you were born.

624
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:49,830
You were so beautiful.

625
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:54,110
Nothing I have is real.

626
01:03:57,220 --> 01:03:58,600
I found him.

627
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:00,980
I told you to be careful.

628
01:04:01,350 --> 01:04:03,960
You knew who he was the whole time.

629
01:04:04,270 --> 01:04:05,430
You built him.

630
01:04:06,970 --> 01:04:08,270
He had a..

631
01:04:09,230 --> 01:04:11,260
Violent unstable mind.

632
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:14,490
His cerebral connection wouldn't hold!

633
01:04:14,930 --> 01:04:17,060
- I tried to save him!
- No.

634
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,560
You left him to die.

635
01:04:30,610 --> 01:04:34,210
<i>Nothing on Kuze yet, sir.
Checking upper zones next.</i>

636
01:04:35,710 --> 01:04:37,430
Is there any word on Major?

637
01:04:38,310 --> 01:04:42,030
<i>She's gone.
Off-grid. Silent.</i>

638
01:04:43,330 --> 01:04:45,070
Copy that, sir.

639
01:04:45,490 --> 01:04:47,400
I know where to find her.

640
01:05:31,270 --> 01:05:33,160
I didn't ask you to come here.

641
01:05:34,310 --> 01:05:35,820
You never ask.

642
01:05:36,550 --> 01:05:38,130
But I always do.

643
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:44,450
Did they send you to bring me in?

644
01:05:46,110 --> 01:05:48,910
I'm just here to fish. Did you see any?

645
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:53,720
You are a company man, you follow orders.
So, if they ordered you to kill me..

646
01:05:54,010 --> 01:05:56,840
Stop saying shit like that.
You're gonna piss me off.

647
01:06:19,630 --> 01:06:21,290
What's it like down there?

648
01:06:23,030 --> 01:06:24,790
It's Cold and dark.

649
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:28,150
Just a million miles away.

650
01:06:29,430 --> 01:06:30,960
No voices.

651
01:06:31,870 --> 01:06:33,480
No data streaming.

652
01:06:34,850 --> 01:06:35,850
Just...

653
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:40,400
nothing.

654
01:06:44,820 --> 01:06:47,860
- It scares me.
- Then Why do you do it?

655
01:06:54,850 --> 01:06:56,290
It feels real.

656
01:06:57,270 --> 01:06:59,160
Why didn't you stop him?

657
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:04,520
I don't know who to trust anymore.

658
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:07,230
You trust me, right?

659
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:13,170
Yes I do.

660
01:07:16,470 --> 01:07:18,150
I just don't like it.

661
01:07:26,630 --> 01:07:28,490
I need you to take me back.

662
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:30,610
There is more I need to find out.

663
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:36,370
Sure.

664
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:55,890
Dr. Ouelet...

665
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:58,280
What have you told her?

666
01:08:00,730 --> 01:08:02,210
She knows.

667
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:04,910
I'm bringing her in.

668
01:08:35,650 --> 01:08:37,520
Hanka security to Headquarters.

669
01:08:38,630 --> 01:08:40,380
We have the Major.

670
01:09:17,650 --> 01:09:19,160
Why is she sedated?

671
01:09:19,900 --> 01:09:22,140
She's been turned by a terrorist.

672
01:09:23,130 --> 01:09:24,840
But you know that already.

673
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:30,160
You should have called
the first time she came to see you.

674
01:09:31,650 --> 01:09:33,160
Instead, you gave
her information.

675
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:34,540
What makes you think you have the..

676
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:37,310
- Right to tell me that?
- 2-5-7-1 took us close.

677
01:09:38,210 --> 01:09:39,930
It's time to move on to the next iteration.

678
01:09:40,210 --> 01:09:41,470
2-5-7-1 is not a failure.

679
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:43,660
I will delete all the
data and reprogram her.

680
01:09:43,890 --> 01:09:46,870
- She won't remember him at all.
- No, no, no, no.

681
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:50,280
You download all the data
on the terrorist...

682
01:09:50,570 --> 01:09:52,600
and then I order you to terminate.

683
01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:59,250
- What?
- We'll build one that's better.

684
01:10:00,370 --> 01:10:03,150
- I'll delete everything.
- You deleted before.

685
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:08,650
- She's mine.
- No.

686
01:10:09,010 --> 01:10:11,160
She is a contract... with me.

687
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:13,060
We succeeded.

688
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:16,780
She is more than human... and more than AI.

689
01:10:17,150 --> 01:10:21,180
We change her entire identity.
But her ghost survived!

690
01:10:21,490 --> 01:10:23,640
Her ghost is what failed us.

691
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:27,700
We can not control her.
She is no longer a viable asset.

692
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,550
You should be the one to do it.

693
01:10:45,190 --> 01:10:47,130
What are you doing to me?

694
01:10:48,890 --> 01:10:51,280
I'll run the standard synaptic.

695
01:10:51,510 --> 01:10:53,680
Upload your data on the raid.

696
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:57,410
I'll find out exactly what Kuze told you.

697
01:10:58,390 --> 01:11:00,330
You know what he told me.

698
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:02,130
The truth.

699
01:11:05,830 --> 01:11:08,120
You're deleting everything, aren't you?

700
01:11:08,450 --> 01:11:09,450
No.

701
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:14,180
So I don't remember...

702
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:16,140
You.

703
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:28,080
My name is Major Mira Killian...

704
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:32,270
And I do not consent
to the deletion of this data.

705
01:11:34,110 --> 01:11:36,560
I do not consent.

706
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:41,030
I do not consent.

707
01:11:41,710 --> 01:11:44,170
We never needed your consent.

708
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:50,000
Yours or anyoneâ€™s.

709
01:11:54,530 --> 01:11:56,510
You're killing me..

710
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:59,250
Right you..?

711
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:19,860
Mira?

712
01:12:22,290 --> 01:12:23,600
Do you hear me?

713
01:12:27,590 --> 01:12:28,590
Mira?

714
01:12:31,770 --> 01:12:34,580
This is your past, your real past. Take it.

715
01:12:36,110 --> 01:12:37,750
- Guards!
- Come on, come on!

716
01:12:37,910 --> 01:12:39,210
Come on, go!

717
01:12:46,580 --> 01:12:47,580
Go!

718
01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:49,180
Go!

719
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:01,910
<i>Security alert on level 25.</i>

01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:05,420

723
01:13:13,490 --> 01:13:15,860
That's the problem with the human heart.

724
01:13:57,160 --> 01:13:58,920
<i>I want to see her scan.</i>

725
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:00,870
She killed Dr. Ouelet.

726
01:14:01,580 --> 01:14:04,900
You are to have no further contact with her.
Hanka security will hunt her from here.

727
01:14:04,980 --> 01:14:07,300
- What are the orders?
- To terminate on sight.

728
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:09,100
You want to kill her? You built her!

729
01:14:09,380 --> 01:14:12,530
- Have your sergeant stand down.
- The Major would never hurt Dr. Oulete.

730
01:14:12,830 --> 01:14:14,480
She is not the major anymore!

731
01:14:14,790 --> 01:14:17,580
We have a section 9 operative
under terrorist programming.

732
01:14:17,890 --> 01:14:20,590
This goes public your unit goes down.

733
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:23,980
<i>You kill her...</i>

734
01:14:24,310 --> 01:14:26,080
<i>You kill us.</i>

735
01:14:26,210 --> 01:14:28,230
I'll take that under advice.

736
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:33,540
So what now?

737
01:15:27,660 --> 01:15:29,400
Oh, the pup pumpkin.

738
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:32,170
Oh, you surprised me.

739
01:15:34,970 --> 01:15:36,710
She likes you.

740
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:39,590
I was looking for...

741
01:15:39,780 --> 01:15:40,780
No, come in.

742
01:15:42,290 --> 01:15:43,630
Yeah, go, come come.

743
01:15:48,060 --> 01:15:52,300
- Can I offer you some tea?
- Okay.

744
01:15:55,770 --> 01:16:02,770
<i>P s a g m e n o . com</i>

745
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:05,760
That... Motoko's room.

746
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:09,780
My daughter died a year ago.

747
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:12,150
I am Sorry.

748
01:16:12,580 --> 01:16:14,370
She run away.

749
01:16:15,330 --> 01:16:17,110
She was a difficult.

750
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,440
We fought.

751
01:16:23,180 --> 01:16:26,760
But I guess we all fight
with our parents, right?

752
01:16:28,260 --> 01:16:29,690
Please come on the sit.

753
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:52,680
What happened to your her?

754
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:55,140
I don't know.

755
01:16:57,500 --> 01:17:01,500
The ministry sent me her ashes, and...

756
01:17:02,710 --> 01:17:05,460
They told me she took her own life.

757
01:17:08,690 --> 01:17:11,970
But Motoko... No, no, no.

758
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:15,260
I never believe them.

759
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:17,830
She was happy...

760
01:17:18,260 --> 01:17:21,570
living in the lawless
zone with her friends.

761
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:25,770
She'd write her manifestos about...

762
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:28,540
how technology was...

763
01:17:29,030 --> 01:17:31,610
destroying the world.

764
01:17:33,170 --> 01:17:35,240
Then one day...

765
01:17:35,690 --> 01:17:37,650
the police came...

766
01:17:37,980 --> 01:17:39,720
and they run.

767
01:17:47,780 --> 01:17:49,430
It's strange.

768
01:17:56,220 --> 01:17:59,860
I see her in so many young women.

769
01:18:00,780 --> 01:18:03,960
On the street, in my dreams.

770
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:07,140
As if she is still here.

771
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:09,840
She was...

772
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:12,030
fearless.

773
01:18:14,780 --> 01:18:16,540
And wild.

774
01:18:17,250 --> 01:18:19,660
You remind me of her.

775
01:18:21,170 --> 01:18:22,240
Sorry.

776
01:18:26,740 --> 01:18:28,760
How do I remind you of her?

777
01:18:30,810 --> 01:18:33,120
The way you look at me.

778
01:18:39,330 --> 01:18:40,570
Who are you?

779
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:45,700
I don't know.

780
01:18:47,190 --> 01:18:48,860
Wait, wait, wait!

781
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:53,300
Will you come again to visit me?

782
01:18:55,140 --> 01:18:56,260
I will.

783
01:19:22,660 --> 01:19:24,210
Aramaki.

784
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:26,160
Listen to me.

785
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:29,130
I was never in a terrorist bombing.

786
01:19:29,460 --> 01:19:30,840
My parents...

787
01:19:31,670 --> 01:19:34,110
Everything was data
they installed in my mind.

788
01:19:35,460 --> 01:19:39,470
And there were others.
Run-aways like me...

789
01:19:40,060 --> 01:19:42,070
considered disposable.

790
01:19:42,780 --> 01:19:45,660
Kuze was one of them.
That's why he's coming.

791
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:47,970
For Hanka.

792
01:19:49,970 --> 01:19:51,190
<i>Can you prove this?</i>

793
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:53,260
Dr. Ouelet can.

794
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:55,470
<i>Ouelet's dead.</i>

795
01:20:01,290 --> 01:20:03,450
<i>Cutter says you killed her.</i>

796
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:10,670
Put me on the grid. I need Kuze to find me.

797
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:14,400
<i>We will be exposed to Cutter.</i>

798
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:17,710
I know, but I have to do this.

799
01:20:18,460 --> 01:20:22,820
<i>I'm going to meet with the Prime Minister.</i>

800
01:20:23,630 --> 01:20:25,810
<i>He must be stopped.</i>

801
01:20:32,340 --> 01:20:34,200
The virus has spread.

802
01:20:57,110 --> 01:20:59,880
<i>All agents stick to mental comms.</i>

803
01:21:41,860 --> 01:21:43,750
<i>Don't send a rabbit...</i>

804
01:21:44,150 --> 01:21:45,150
<i>to kill a fox.</i>

805
01:21:53,510 --> 01:21:55,350
<i>We are burned.</i>

806
01:21:56,940 --> 01:21:58,280
<i>I repeat.</i>

807
01:21:59,530 --> 01:22:01,410
<i>We are burned.</i>

808
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:06,740
We have located Major on the grid.
She's in the lawless zone.

809
01:23:07,190 --> 01:23:09,180
Air support 5 minutes out.

810
01:23:09,940 --> 01:23:12,380
Is the spider tank within range?

811
01:23:13,940 --> 01:23:16,060
Yes sir. Awaiting your orders sir.

812
01:24:20,710 --> 01:24:22,380
Motoko!

813
01:25:30,730 --> 01:25:32,270
It is real.

814
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:37,560
This place.

815
01:25:45,290 --> 01:25:47,670
I remember what they did to us.

816
01:25:48,070 --> 01:25:52,540
Cutter and his men.
This is where they took us from.

817
01:25:59,570 --> 01:26:01,230
We used to sleep right here.

818
01:26:03,110 --> 01:26:05,050
We were like a family.

819
01:26:05,390 --> 01:26:07,280
All of us run away.

820
01:26:08,910 --> 01:26:10,460
We had nothing...

821
01:26:14,430 --> 01:26:16,090
except each other.

822
01:26:19,910 --> 01:26:21,760
They took that from us.

823
01:26:38,170 --> 01:26:40,040
Your name was Hideo.

824
01:26:51,510 --> 01:26:52,910
Motoko.

825
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:57,370
That was your name.

826
01:27:00,940 --> 01:27:02,260
Motoko.

827
01:27:06,190 --> 01:27:07,610
Come with me...

828
01:27:08,910 --> 01:27:10,790
into my network.

829
01:27:11,690 --> 01:27:14,110
We will evolve beyond them.

830
01:27:14,890 --> 01:27:19,490
And together we can avenge
what they have done to us.

831
01:27:20,260 --> 01:27:21,260
Come...

832
01:27:21,590 --> 01:27:23,250
with me.

833
01:27:41,290 --> 01:27:42,820
I will take control from here.

834
01:27:43,270 --> 01:27:45,130
<i>Weapons system manual command.</i>

835
01:27:46,580 --> 01:27:48,940
<i>Spider tank now active</i>

836
01:27:57,950 --> 01:27:59,820
It's Cutter! He found us!

837
01:29:38,190 --> 01:29:39,400
<i>Target acquired</i>

838
01:29:41,690 --> 01:29:42,740
No!

839
01:29:52,240 --> 01:29:54,080
<i>Target eliminated.</i>

840
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,680
You came close...

841
01:30:11,890 --> 01:30:13,240
you freak.

842
01:30:45,580 --> 01:30:47,860
<i>Motor center compromised.</i>

843
01:31:31,190 --> 01:31:32,830
Sniper team on site?

844
01:31:33,590 --> 01:31:35,720
Approaching the target now sir.

845
01:31:38,050 --> 01:31:39,600
Come with me.

846
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,920
There is no place for us here.

847
01:31:48,900 --> 01:31:49,990
No.

848
01:31:55,780 --> 01:31:58,100
I'm not ready to leave.

849
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:01,350
I belong here.

850
01:32:05,050 --> 01:32:07,850
I'll always be there with you...

851
01:32:08,830 --> 01:32:10,660
your ghost.

852
01:32:17,420 --> 01:32:18,420
Target is in view.

853
01:32:18,930 --> 01:32:20,300
What are you waiting for?

854
01:32:20,510 --> 01:32:21,510
Do it!

855
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:25,440
No!

856
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:27,590
Keep firing.

857
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:32,720
<i>Saito, have you found Major? Is she safe?</i>

858
01:32:35,310 --> 01:32:36,480
She will be.

859
01:32:58,950 --> 01:33:00,030
Hey..

860
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:03,560
Hey.

861
01:33:07,340 --> 01:33:09,310
Say something nice.

862
01:33:10,750 --> 01:33:12,250
What's your name?

863
01:33:12,820 --> 01:33:16,180
Aramaki told me you had a name from before.

864
01:33:20,050 --> 01:33:21,800
Motoko.

865
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:28,570
Major still in there, right?

866
01:33:30,550 --> 01:33:31,980
I am.

867
01:33:47,540 --> 01:33:48,740
<i>Mr. Cutter.</i>

868
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:51,510
<i>I talked with the Prime Minister.</i>

869
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:55,100
<i>You are accused of murder
and crimes against the state.</i>

870
01:33:59,960 --> 01:34:01,710
I thought that it might be you.

871
01:34:05,990 --> 01:34:08,000
<i>It is unwise to resist.</i>

872
01:34:28,290 --> 01:34:29,290
Please.

873
01:34:29,750 --> 01:34:30,910
<i>Major?</i>

874
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:33,810
<i>I am with Cutter.</i>

875
01:34:34,540 --> 01:34:36,610
<i>Do you wanna say anything
before I kill him?</i>

876
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:39,450
Tell him this is justice.

877
01:34:40,220 --> 01:34:41,980
It's what I was built for.

878
01:34:42,890 --> 01:34:45,440
So do you give consent?

879
01:34:46,380 --> 01:34:48,030
My name is Major.

880
01:34:49,010 --> 01:34:50,900
And I give my consent.

881
01:36:01,950 --> 01:36:04,300
You don't have to come here anymore.

882
01:36:07,060 --> 01:36:08,620
I know.

883
01:36:43,100 --> 01:36:45,870
My mind is human.

884
01:36:47,340 --> 01:36:49,420
My body is manufactured.

885
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:53,400
I am the first of my kind, but...

886
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:56,770
I won't be the last.

887
01:37:01,250 --> 01:37:04,560
We cling to memories
as if they define us.

888
01:37:05,750 --> 01:37:08,710
But what we do defines us.

889
01:37:15,110 --> 01:37:18,260
My ghost survived
to remind the next of us...

890
01:37:19,100 --> 01:37:22,330
that humanity is our virtue.

891
01:37:24,270 --> 01:37:26,100
I know who I am...

892
01:37:27,150 --> 01:37:28,980
and what I'm here to do.

893
01:37:33,510 --> 01:37:34,320
<i>Major.</i>

894
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:36,350
<i>Engage targets.</i>

895
01:37:51,180 --> 01:37:52,770
<i>You're authorized.</i>
