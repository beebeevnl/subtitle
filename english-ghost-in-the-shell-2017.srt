It's ok, just breathe.

17
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,470
Just breathe.

18
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,360
Breathe.

19
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,650
Good.

20
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,560
That's good.

21
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,290
Hello Mira.

22
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,750
I'm Dr. Ouelet.

23
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,040
Do you remember anything
about the attack?

24
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,810
What...?

25
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,890
I was... drowning.

26
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,680
There was water.

27
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,170
That's right, you were on a boat.
A refugee boat.

28
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,720
It was sunk by terrorists.

29
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,900
Why can't I feel my body?

30
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:38,210
Mira, your body was damaged,
we couldn't save it.

31
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,790
Only your brain survived.

32
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,380
We made you a new body.

33
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,670
A synthetic shell.

34
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,240
But your mind, your soul,

35
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,930
your ghost,

36
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,910
it's still in there.

37
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,700
Please.

38
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,160
Sedate her.

39
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,760
Will it work?

40
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,880
Absolutely.

41
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,360
She's a miracle.

42
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,350
A machine can't lead,
it can only follow orders.

43
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:28,500
A machine can't imagine,
or care, or intuit.

44
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,130
But as a human mind in
a cybernetic frame,

45
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,860
Mira can do all those things
and more.

46
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,000
The first of her kind.

47
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:42,230
She will join Section 9
as soon as she's operational.

48
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,650
Please don't do that.

49
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:48,250
You're reducing a complex human
to a machine.

50
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:50,750
I don't think of her as a machine.

51
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,710
She's a weapon.

52
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,670
And the future of my company.

53
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:14,980

<i>Repeat: All patrolling area units,

65
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,290
This is Major.

66
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,410
Awaiting instructions.

67
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,140
<i>Analyze and report.</i>

68
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:28,610
I'm human, I'm flawed,

69
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:32,160
but I embrace change

70
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:34,440
and enhancement.

71
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,380
Now, there's nothing I can't do.

72
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:41,340
Nothing I can't know, nothing I can't be.

73
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:43,840
I want you to listen to something.

74
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:52,340
<i>Au clair de la lune,
mon ami Pierrot.</i>

75
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,260
It's my 4 year old daughter.

76
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:58,790
In the time it took her to sing that
lullaby she learned to speak fluent French.

77
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,810
<i>Do you know that song...?</i>

78
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,400
<i>- Is there an echo box up here?
- Why do you ask?</i>

79
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,140
Someone's scanning data traffic.

80
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,200
<i>Trace where it's transmitting.</i>

81
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,990
Let's see who's worth
this kind of surveillance.

82
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,650
Accessing hotel security network.

83
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,530
What are you seeing, sir?
I've got a lot of hotel to scan.

84
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:30,250
<i>There is a banquet room reserved for
the President of the African Federation.</i>

85
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:33,910
<i>Dr. Osmond is invited
on behalf of Hanka Robotics.</i>

86
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,550
Got it. 43rd floor.

87
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:43,940
Someone's contacted the president's staff.
Someone's watching him.

88
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,470
Dr. Osmond,
what is it you want from us?

89
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,680
I think it's more about what
Hanka Robotics can do for you.

90
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:55,850
73% of this world has woken up
to the age of cyber enhancement.

91
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,780
Do you really wanna be left behind?

92
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:02,300
My people embrace cyber enhancement,
as do I.

93
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,400
There's no one who really
understands the risk

94
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,830
to individuality, identity,
messing with the human soul.

95
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,770
Gentlemen, excuse me,
I think you have the wrong...

96
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,050
Hallway. Six men.
Shots fired.

97
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,140
Section 9 ETA?

98
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,040
- Two minutes out, Major.
- Too long.

99
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,710
I'm going in.

100
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
<i>Hold!</i>

101
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,250
<i>Mayor, stop!</i>

102
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,220
I've heard this speech before
from your competitors.

103
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:47,950
- And now Hanka Robotics serves it...
- What are you doing?

104
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,050
Look.
This is what I'm talking about.

105
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:58,770
<i>Major!</i>

106
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,620
<i>Initiate the hack.</i>

107
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,890
<i>Help me. Please.
Don't let me die.</i>

00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,260
Who sent you?

109
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,970
<i>Help me. Please.</i>

110
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,250
Answer me!

111

<i>Collaborate with Hanka Robotics

112
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,730
You okay?

113
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,460
You're injured.

114
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,940
You're not the same.

115
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,390
Hey, it's just a robot!

116
00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:00,380
<i>Your skin deserves the best, so do you.
Try our hand cream.</i>

117

<i>DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE,
CENTRAL OFFICE, SECTION 9</i>

118
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:24,920
- So what do we have on Osmond?
- So far, very little.

119
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,450
He was the head
of Hanka's Robotics Division.

120
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,080
Human,
but of course cyber enhanced.

121
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,990
So how did they hack him?

122
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,650
Somehow this geisha bot
got past his encryption.

123
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,430
Something's different.

124
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,930
What'd you get?

125
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,290
Why are you always thinking
he's out there enhancing.

126
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,110
Because he is.

127
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,340
Cyber mech liver.

128
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:49,970
Been saving up for a while.
Now it's last call every night.

129
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,480
You got enhanced
so you can drink more?

130
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:56,720
Embrace enhancements, Togusa.
We wouldn't be here without it.

131
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,720
I'm all human and happy,
thanks.

132
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:03,350
Any more information
about the seized geisha bot?

133
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,000
Hanka's running scans.

134
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:07,490
Dr. Dahlin will have the
reports ready but...

135
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,060
<i>I've been talking to the Prime Minister.</i>

136
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:18,330
<i>He wants a full report.</i>

137
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:20,290
<i>Togusa.</i>

138
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,490
Following last night's attack,

139
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:27,660
3 more Hanka scientists
were murdered,

140
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:29,740
at the company's central laboratory.

141
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,660
The first two were shot.

142
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:36,500
And the third was beaten to death
by his own service robot.

143
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,590
All showed signs of cerebral hacking.

144
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,780
The same as the geisha did to Osmond.

145
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:47,910
And all were senior figures in Hanka.

146
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,890
Just like Osmond.

147
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:54,450
A message was left
at each of the crime scenes

148
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,350
by someone identifying himself...

149
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,320
as Kuze.

00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:27,760
<i>Find out what has been

157
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,580
<i>Major!</i>

158
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,260
<i>I told you not jump off.</i>

159
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:50,150
I had to, or more would have died.

160
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:54,840
<i>You're a member of my team,
and my responsibility</i>

161
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:58,770
I will find him and I will kill him.

162
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:02,610
It's what I am built for, isn't it?

163
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,460
<i>You are more than just a weapon.</i>

164
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:15,340
<i>You have a soul, a ghost.</i>

165
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:20,500
<i>When we see our
uniqueness as a virtue,</i>

166
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:23,710
<i>only then will we find peace.</i>

167
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:31,440
<i>Safely reconfiguring the
child's genetic structure.</i>

168
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,070
<i>Families built better.</i>

169
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,910
What was going on with
you at the hotel last night?

170
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,440
- Nothing, I'm fine.
- You sure?

171
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:43,210
<i>- Hey, sweetheart, want an upgrade?
- Move.</i>

172
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:46,010
<i>- I have anything you want.
- Back off!</i>

173
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,620
- Hey, Ming!
- Hey, Batou!

174
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,920
- Got your bones.
- Thanks man.

175
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:58,450
- What are they for?
- For the dogs.

176
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,630
For someone who doesn't like people
how come you care about dogs so much?

177
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,100
Don't know. I like just strays
and they like me.

178
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,160
They like you 'cause you feed them.

179
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,460
You got no heart.

180
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,370
Hey, girls!

181
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,290
Hey Gabriel!

182
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:20,730
Meet Major.

183
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,610
Major, Gabriel.

184
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,480
I used to have a dog.

185
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,970
Seriously?

186
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,590
I had you down, as more of a cat person.

187
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:43,260
You don't talk about that stuff.

188
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,540
What?

189
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:47,520
- Your past.
- I don't remember much.

190
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,480
Just fragments, bits and pieces.

191
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,850
What about family?

192
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,690
My parents, they died
bringing us to this country.

193
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:59,480
Our boat sank in the harbor.
I almost drowned.

194
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:05,160
It feels like there's always
this thick fog over my memory

195
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,060
and I can't seen through it.

196
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,060
You're lucky.

197
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,980
Every single day,
I get screwed by my memories.

198
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,960
It's better to be pure.

199
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:15,590
Like you.

200
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,070
<i>HANKA CENTRAL OFFICE OF ROBOTICS</i>

201
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,380

204
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,750
Your have damaged internal systems.

205
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,390
Maybe next time you can design me better.

206
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:00,670
- How are you?
- I'm fine. I can't feel anything.

207
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,320
No you, in There.

208
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,880
I've been having glitches.

209
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,090
But they'll pass.

210
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:12,120
- Have you been taking your medication?
- Yeah.

211
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:15,710
These ones are still cycling.
I had two this morning.

212
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:18,410
- Sound or image?
- Both.

213
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,730
I see it.

214
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,850
You made any unencrypted downloads?

215
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,390
- No. Just delete them from me.
- Consent?

216
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:33,520
My name is Major Mary Killian.
I give my consent to delete this data.

217
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,100
It's done.

218
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,040
- No big deal.
- What are they?

219
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,510
Sensory echoes from your mind, shadows.

220
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:42,850
I'm not sure.

221
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,880
How do you know what's a glitch
and what's me?

222
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,900
The glitches have a different texture...

223
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:50,170
to the rest of your code.

224
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,980
I can see everything.

225
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,680
All of your thoughts, your... decisions.

226
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,910
- I guess privacy is just for humans.
- You are human.

227
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:06,050
People see you as human.

228
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:08,580
Everyone around me seems to fit.

229
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:14,140
They seem connected to something.
Something I'm... not.

230
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,720
- It's like I have no past.
- Of course you have a past.

231
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:22,430
And with time you'll feel more and more
connected to it and to them.

232
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,060
Opens and close, please.

233
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:40,200
We cling to memories
as if they define us, but...

234
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,060
they really don't.

235
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:46,850
What we do is what defines us.

236
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:53,450
<i>You are entering a Hanka secure area.
Authorized personnel only.</i>

237
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:56,920
<i>Please disable communication enhancement.</i>

238
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,030
I'm busy.

239
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,650
Dr. Dahlin!
Are you finished yet?

240
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:04,070
If you hadn't riddled
the Geisha with bullets,

241
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:05,190
this would be much easier.

242
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,900
- I didn't shoot'em.
- I did.

243
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,130
This is gonna take days.

244
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:14,050
I need to run hundreds
of potential simulations.

245
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:15,910
We don't have the time.

246
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:21,680
She was a Hanka companion bot.

247
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:25,260
But she was reprogrammed
for cerebral hacking.

248
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:28,050
What was on her drives?

249
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:31,650
Nothing. The data was destroyed
as it was transmitted.

250
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,090
No sign of what she was after.

251
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:37,270
Her hardware was vandalized.

252
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:39,650
They ripped her up.

253
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:41,930
Then I have to do a deep dive.

254
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:44,910
You can't encrypt during a deep dive

255
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,550
I know.

256
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:52,430
They could've left traps in her.
Mag pulses, viruses.

257
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,870
She's right.

258
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:58,680
You will be exposing your mind to
who ever hacked her. You'll be wide open.

259
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:06,200
I have to get inside her memory.
It's the fastest way to find Kuze.

260
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,610
It's too dangerous.

261
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:16,290
And highly irresponsible.

262
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,600
Are you sure?

263
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:26,260
You see any bad code headed my way,
pull me out.

264
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:31,410
How come you're the one sweating?

265
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,240
Run it.

266
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:52,210
Cyber mind connection to the Major,
now active...

267
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,220
and unencrypted

268
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:57,850
consent required for data download.

269
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:01,660
My name is Major Mira Killian
and I give my consent.

270
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:42,960
Disconnect. Get her out.

271
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:46,440
- Get her out!
- I'm trying, but she's being hacked.

272
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:51,740
Get her out now!

273
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:56,010
Now!

274
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,160
Are you okay?

275
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:19,840
I know this place.

276
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,880
They run black market here.

277
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:24,500
You tooled up?

278
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,040
- Yep.
- Target is in the basement. I'll lead.

279
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,970
Switching to mind coms.

280
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,450
- Hope you've been practicing.
- That's unfair.

281
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:36,030
Just text me the moment
you are in.

282
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:37,800
Get the hang of it.

283
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:51,290
Two mercs at the door.
Armed and enhanced.

284
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:53,900
Copy that.
We got it covered.

285
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,880
There's a lot of heat in here
for a nightclub.

286
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:10,000
It's a Yakuza club. What did you expect?

287
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,800
I quite like the place.

288
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:14,090
Why doesn't that surprise me?

289
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:18,960
I'm gonna have to draw some attention.
See if I can access the basement that way.

290
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,300
You're not here
looking for any trouble, are you?

291
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:28,130
I'm just here for the girls... and beer.

292
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:34,190
- Can I help you?
- I'm looking for someone.

293
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:35,550
You been here before?

294
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:38,670
My friend had some mech work done here.
Industry stuff.

295
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,090
We don't do mech work here.

296
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,140
My mistake.

297
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:46,080
Why don't you come have fun with us?
Have some privacy.

298
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,310
I'm in.

299
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:57,490
I'll be here when you need me.

300
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:14,170
- You say your friend worked here?
- I said my friend had work done here.

301
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,650
She's human?

302
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:18,660
Your friend.

303
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:21,210
What's that supposed to mean?

304
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,540
Batou.

305
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:23,990
Can you hear me?

306
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:28,030
Who did this stunning work on you?

307
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,070
It's divine.

308
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,300
Ladriya... guns.

309
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:40,550
Here.

310
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,240
Batou, I'm losing signal.

311
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:47,540
Don't worry sweety.

312
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:50,020
We have privacy.

313
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:52,830
Listen.

314
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:55,590
No signals going in or out.

315
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:59,230
Major, I'm in position. Do you copy?

316
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,440
Beer.

317
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,640
If you don't answer,
you're gonna hurt my feelings.

318
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,830
Ladriya, do you have Major on Comms?

319
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:18,630
Got nothing. Signal's still blocked.

320
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:21,860
I'm afraid I get bored rather easily, so...

321
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:24,130
You don't wanna talk...

322
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:28,090
Maybe you wanna dance!

323
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:32,530
Major, come on. Answer me.

324
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:50,450
I thought you said no trouble.

325
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,540
Dance!

326
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,390
The truth is...

327
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,690
I wasn't built to dance.

328
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:00,620
Back on comms.
I'm heading to the back room.

329
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:04,580
I missed you. I'll meet you there.

330
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:39,280
<i>Collaborate with Hanka Robotics
and be destroyed.</i>

331
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,090
Major?

332
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:25,690
Where's Batou?

333
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,520
In enhancement, next door.
He's doing well.

334
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:33,580
You took most of the blast.

335
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,450
I saw him down there.

336
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,620
It was like...

337
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,180
He waited to see me.

338
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,830
We synaptic scanned you.

339
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:51,460
Everything you witnessed
went to Section 9 to evaluate.

340
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,030
You know, the scan...

341
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,630
also turned up the number of glitches.

342
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,350
They've been getting worse.

343
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:04,480
Since when?

344
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,070
Since the deep dive.

345
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,330
Do any of the glitches
mean something to you?

346
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:28,860
No.

347
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,020
They don't.

348
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:36,050
You've been inside
the same shell as he has.

349
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:40,580
That could have very serious consequences.

350
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,730
You were not authorized
to deep dive the geisha.

351
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:47,590
You're disappointed.

352
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:50,820
No, I'm worried.

353
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:55,150
You're not invulnerable.

354
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:59,700
I can repair your body,
but I can't protect your mind.

355
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,800
Why not?

356
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,550
You can see all my thoughts so...

357
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:10,000
You should be able to secure them.

358
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,410
Try and understand
your importance Mira.

359
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:20,390
You're what everyone will become one day.

360
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:25,920
You don't know how alone
that makes me feel.

361
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:45,660
I can see you out there, you know.

362
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:50,340
How many fingers am I holding up?

363
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,640
Funny.

364
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,740
Say something nice.

365
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,850
You chose those?

366
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,770
They're tactical.

367
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:12,840
- Always for the job.
- What else I got?

368
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:15,340
- They suit you.
- Yeah?

369
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:18,180
I got night vision, zoom...

370
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:19,870
and X-ray.

371
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:23,300
I guess I see like you now.

372
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:26,430
Don't worry, you'll get used to it.

373
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,700
Thanks for saving my ass.

374
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,580
Glad to see you're okay.

375
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,520
Major?

376
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:38,830
Could you feed the dogs for me?

377
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:41,920
I don't wanna scare them.

378
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:43,530
Anytime.

379
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:30,580
Are you insufficiently funded, Mr. Aramaki?

380
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:34,480
Is section 9 missing some
critical operational resource?

381
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:37,680
<i>We have everything that we require.</i>

382
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:42,220
Major is our most sophisticated weapon
only if she's intact.

383
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:48,750
And Dr. Ouelet informed me that
you let her dive a corrupted geisha.

384
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,230
You realize the supreme importance

385
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:01,070
that Hanka represents to this government.

386
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:04,780
Major is the future of my company.

387
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:08,180
If you compromise
your systems again...

388
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,810
I will burn this section.

389
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,680
<i>Yes sir.</i>

390
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,030
<i>Mr. Cutter.</i>

391
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,720
<i>Be careful who you the threaten.</i>

392
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:25,880
<i>I'm accountable to the Prime Minister,
not to Hanka.</i>

393
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:15,760
<i>Create your own beauty.
Beauty enhanced.</i>

394
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,040
You human?

395
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:30,620
Yeah.

396
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,140
Can you take that off?

397
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,820
So I can see your face?

398
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:08,100
What does that feel like?

399
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:09,490
It feels...

400
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,360
different.

401
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:24,420
What are you?

402
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,080
SECURE PROJECT 2571

403
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:53,790
HANKA PERSONNEL FILES

404
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:02,090
Look at me.

405
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:07,400
Tell me what they took from me.

406
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:12,500
I'm sorry.
They never told us.

407
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:37,680
It feels weird driving
with these eyes.

408
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,830
Why do you take that?

409
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:46,130
Keeps my brain from rejecting
this body.

410
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:50,490
Major, Batou, you need to get here.

411
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:51,830
What've you got?

412
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:54,450
Another Hanka scientist
has been found dead.

413
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:56,030
It's Dahlin.

414
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:57,550
Got it.

415
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:06,360
Major this way.

416
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:35,870
<i>SECURE - PROJECT 2571</i>

417
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:37,530
What is that?

418
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:41,300
She found what Kuze stole from Osmond.

419
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:46,860
It's a list of everyone
who worked on a project called 2571.

420
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:48,850
That's who he's targeting.

421
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:51,160
Is there anyone else on that list?

422
00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:53,760
<i>DR. OUELET</i>

423
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:56,360
Find Ouelet. Now!

424
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:59,540
She's in transit. Her comms are down.

425
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:06,250
<i>I'm looking at her and I'mm thinking:</i>

426
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:08,710
<i>"You want me to pay for violin too?"</i>

427
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,290
<i>Don't get me wrong.</i>

428
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,970
<i>I love that kid to pieces.</i>

429
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:15,160
<i>I do. She's amazing.</i>

430
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:18,390
<i>But when she practices that thing,
it is painful, right?</i>

431
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:20,470
<i>Why not piano?</i>

432
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:25,270
<i>I mean, it's the same price,
and doesn't sound so bad.</i>

433
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:29,970
<i>At least if you can't play that proper,
it sounds...</i>

434
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:22,150
<i>2-5-7-1!
Tell me everything!</i>

435
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:36,120
<i>Are you prepare
to die for 2-5-7...?</i>

436
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:46,230
Go!

437
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:02,290
Go!

438
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:01,190
Who is Kuze?

439
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:03,940
- Why does he wanna kill Ouelet?
- I don't know anything.

440
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:08,670
Enough, enough!

441
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:12,280
We need him alive.

442
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:18,750
Please. I have been through this.

443
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:21,910
You have the wrong guy.

444
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:25,460
So tell us who we do have.

445
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:30,240
My name is Lee Cunningham.

446
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:35,920
- Where'd you get the weapons?
- I don't know.

447
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:36,820
Who loaded the...?

448
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,330
I don't know anything about the weapons,
alright I told you.

449
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:42,030
I was picking up my daughter.
She takes violin lessons.

450
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:43,690
What's her name?

451
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:51,440
- Is this her?
- Yeah. Isn't she a little angel?

452
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:53,670
- This is your daughter?
- Right.

453
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:57,890
Do you have kids?

454
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:02,720
Where do you live?

455
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:06,310
I can't remember.

456
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:09,620
I think it's a tall place.
Is it a tall building?

457
00:49:10,010 --> 00:49:11,720
It's a tall place, right?

458
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:14,630
You don't have a child.

459
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:20,810
You don't have a wife.
You live alone, just you.

460
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:22,630
- What? No.
- We went to your apartment.

461
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:23,990
- There was nobody there.
- No.

462
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:25,610
You live there for
10 years by yourself.

463
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:25,880
No.

464
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:28,280
- You're just lying.
- I'm not lying.

465
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:30,950
I didn't kill anyone!

466
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:33,470
- Why do you keep doing this to me?
- Holocube disconnect.

467
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:34,890
Please!

468
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,600
I didn't do anything.

469
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:40,120
Why do you keep
saying this to me?

470
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:42,500
I don't understand. How can he not know?

471
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:46,580
The hack must have created a vacuum.
Kuze's wiped his memory...

472
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:49,500
and somehow installed a new reality.

473
00:49:50,970 --> 00:49:53,300
At least he got to believe he had a kid.

474
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:56,070
What's the difference huh?

475
00:49:57,530 --> 00:49:59,360
Fantasy, reality...

476
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,540
Dreams, memories...

477
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,180
it's all the same.

478
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:06,540
Just noise.

479
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:09,340
It's him.

480
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:13,870
He's in there.

481
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,900
This cube is secure. He can't be, Major.

482
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:20,610
The lie detector!

483
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:22,260
He must've hacked in that way.

484
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:25,190
We should uplink to the machine,
trace the code, get a lock on his location.

485
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:26,220
Do it.

486
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:28,690
Don't go in there.
It's too dangerous.

487
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:31,020
<i>Major</i>

488
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:33,930
<i>We don't know what else he can do.</i>

489
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:48,650
The signal's unstable.
Can you get the lock on him?

490
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:50,420
We gotta move fast.
We're losing him.

491
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:51,830
Connecting.

492
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:55,780
Who are you?

493
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:00,080
Come here.

494
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:03,780
I'm shy.

495
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:07,130
I'm not beautiful...

496
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:08,640
like you.

497
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:13,640
Tell me who you are.

498
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:16,850
I have been born more than once.

499
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:20,120
So I have more than one name

500
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:22,180
I'll find you.

501
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:24,110
Not yet.

502
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:26,300
I'm not done.

503
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,680
The machine's tracing his location.

504
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:30,250
We got a fix!

505
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:37,560
I need to see her.

506
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:39,600
No Please. I know..what...

507
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:41,040
We got'im.

508
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:50,570
Let's go.

509
00:51:53,600 --> 00:52:04,600
P S A G M E N O .com

510
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,530
Weapons armed.

511
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:10,750
- Go.
- On me.

512
00:52:58,790 --> 00:53:00,650
Stay Down! Stay Down!

513
00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:12,350
Put it down, put it down.

514
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:20,780
Grenade!

515
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:18,820
Major!

516
00:54:19,350 --> 00:54:20,630
Come in.

517
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:23,880
I know why we couldn't find him.

518
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:29,970
He's using human minds
to create a network of his own.

519
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:31,610
We're coming to your position.

520
00:55:46,850 --> 00:55:48,670
Tell me who you are.

521
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:55,550
I'm that which you seek to destroy.

522
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:01,830
In this life, my name is...

523
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:03,930
Kuze.

524
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:08,600
What are you doing to me?

525
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:16,460
I have, connected you,
to a network of my own creation.

526
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:19,130
W-w-when I'm finished in this world...

527
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:23,800
my ghost can survive
there and regenerate.

528
00:56:24,270 --> 00:56:26,430
What do you want from me?

529
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:29,070
I became...

530
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:32,340
fascinated with you.

531
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:35,630
Reading y-y-your code...

532
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:38,520
when you were inside that geisha.

533
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:44,700
Like nothing I had felt before,
yet so...

534
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:46,900
familiar.

535
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:51,280
We are the same.

536
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:53,390
We're not the same.

537
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:58,030
You kill innocent people.

538
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:01,160
Innocent? Is that what you call them?

539
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,300
I am as they made me.

540
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:07,090
Who made you?

541
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,300
What have they told you?

542
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,920
That you were the first?

543
00:57:12,410 --> 00:57:14,860
The first cerebral salvage.

544
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:21,360
You were born of lessons they
took from my failure.

545
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:25,040
What are you talking about?

546
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:31,430
I was conscious while they
dismembered my body, and discarded me

547
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,690
like garbage.

548
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:37,340
I was lying on a table,

549
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:42,580
listening to doctors talk about how
my mind had not meshed with the shell,

550
00:57:43,110 --> 00:57:44,940
that they had built;

551
00:57:45,970 --> 00:57:49,250
how project t-two, five, seven, one

552
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:51,030
had failed,

553
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,720
and they had to move on...

554
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:01,210
to you.

555
00:58:08,490 --> 00:58:10,820
What a beauty you are!

556
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:16,390
They have improved s-so much,

557
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:18,530
since they made me.

558
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:25,850
They thought that we would be
a part of their evolution.

559
00:58:26,190 --> 00:58:28,530
But they have created us,

560
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:31,230
to evolve alone...

561
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:37,490
beyond them.

562
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:40,470
Evolution? That's what you call...

563
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:43,220
killing everyone who made you?

564
00:58:43,670 --> 00:58:45,920
You're not listening to me.

565
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:48,020
You're a murderer.

566
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,330
They tried to kill me first.

567
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:55,090
It is self-defense.

568
00:58:55,410 --> 00:58:57,270
Defense of self!

569
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:01,680
More will die...

570
00:59:04,090 --> 00:59:07,740
until they tell me what they took.

571
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:09,320
I won't let that happen.

572
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:13,200
You want to kill me?

573
00:59:17,730 --> 00:59:19,680
Like everyone else?

574
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:27,660
Do it, then.

575
00:59:31,050 --> 00:59:33,130
Do what you were programmed to do.

576
00:59:45,110 --> 00:59:46,310
What is that?

577
00:59:58,450 --> 01:00:00,010
What is that?

578
01:00:01,530 --> 01:00:05,510
I c-c-can't remember,
but I am haunted by it.

579
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,300
Do You see it?

580
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:14,880
Togusa!

581
01:00:19,910 --> 01:00:24,080
Don't take the medication
that they give you.

582
01:00:24,730 --> 01:00:27,470
They use it to suppress your memories.

583
01:00:28,070 --> 01:00:31,780
Your shell belongs to them,
but not your ghost.

584
01:00:32,530 --> 01:00:34,230
Your ghost is yours.

585
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:36,070
Remember that.

586
01:00:36,310 --> 01:00:39,260
And maybe you can remember it all.

587
01:00:47,630 --> 01:00:50,030
Get away from her!
Get down on the ground now.

588
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:57,290
Major!

589
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:08,060
Major!

590
01:01:26,630 --> 01:01:28,090
Oh, Mira!

591
01:01:29,030 --> 01:01:30,860
My got, you are safe!

592
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:34,640
You have been gone
for hours.

593
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:37,700
And no one knew where
you were.

594
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:48,210
You are scaring me.

595
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:52,790
Calm down.

596
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:58,810
How many were there
before me?

597
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:05,340
The integrases of shelling your mind,
it had never been done before.

598
01:02:06,430 --> 01:02:08,670
It was inevitable that we will
be failures.

599
01:02:10,330 --> 01:02:11,540
How many?

600
01:02:15,890 --> 01:02:16,630
...Dozens.

601
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:23,320
How many?

602
01:02:27,050 --> 01:02:30,150
98 unsuccessful attempts,
before you.

603
01:02:32,590 --> 01:02:34,730
You killed 98 innocent people?

604
01:02:34,930 --> 01:02:37,370
No, I didn't kill anyone.

605
01:02:38,690 --> 01:02:39,690
You wouldn't be here.

606
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:42,840
You wouldn't exist if it
weren't for those experiments.

607
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:44,640
Experiments?

608
01:02:46,410 --> 01:02:48,730
- Is that what I am to you?
- No!

609
01:02:50,950 --> 01:02:52,420
No, Mira!

610
01:02:57,830 --> 01:02:59,780
Sacrifices were made.

611
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:04,260
Where did the bodies come from?

612
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:08,350
Where did I come from?

613
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:12,050
Mr. Cutter brought them to us.

614
01:03:12,470 --> 01:03:14,300
I didn't ask questions.

615
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:15,900
The harbor?

616
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:18,210
My parents?

617
01:03:18,910 --> 01:03:20,560
The way they died?

618
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:23,960
Did that happen?

619
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:28,260
No.

620
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:33,830
We gave you false memories.

621
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:36,850
Cutter wanted to motivate you.

622
01:03:37,420 --> 01:03:39,690
To fight terrorists.
I didn't approve.

623
01:03:40,030 --> 01:03:43,450
It was cruel, but my work,
that was important, and...

624
01:03:44,210 --> 01:03:45,710
you were born.

625
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:48,970
You were so beautiful.

626
01:03:51,090 --> 01:03:53,250
Nothing I have is real.

627
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:57,740
I found him.

628
01:03:58,690 --> 01:04:00,120
I told you to be careful.

629
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:03,110
You knew who he was the whole time.

630
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:04,580
You built him.

631
01:04:06,110 --> 01:04:07,420
He had a..

632
01:04:08,370 --> 01:04:10,410
violent unstable mind.

633
01:04:11,420 --> 01:04:13,630
His cerebral connection wouldn't hold!

634
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:16,210
- I tried to save him!
- No.

635
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:18,700
You left him to die.

636
01:04:30,010 --> 01:04:33,600
<i>Nothing on Kuze yet, sir.
Checking upper zones next.</i>

637
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:36,830
Is there any word on Major?

638
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:41,430
<i>She's gone.
Off-grid. Silent.</i>

639
01:04:42,730 --> 01:04:44,460
Copy that, sir.

640
01:04:44,890 --> 01:04:46,800
I know where to find her.

641
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:32,550
I didn't ask you to come here.

642
01:05:33,710 --> 01:05:35,210
You never ask.

643
01:05:35,750 --> 01:05:37,320
But I always do.

644
01:05:41,990 --> 01:05:43,650
Did they send you to bring me in?

645
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:48,100
I'm just here to fish. Did you see any?

646
01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:52,720
You're a company man, you follow orders.
So, if they ordered you to kill me.

647
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,830
Stop saying shit like that.
You're gonna piss me off.

648
01:06:18,630 --> 01:06:20,290
What's it like down there?

649
01:06:22,030 --> 01:06:23,790
It's cold and dark.

650
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:27,150
Just a million miles away.

651
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:29,960
No voices.

652
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:32,470
No data streaming.

653
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:34,840
Just...

654
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:39,400
nothing.

655
01:06:43,810 --> 01:06:46,860
- It scares me.
- Then why do you do it?

656
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,290
It feels real.

657
01:06:56,270 --> 01:06:58,150
Why didn't you stop him?

658
01:07:01,530 --> 01:07:03,510
I dunno who to trust anymore.

659
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:06,230
You trust me, right?

660
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:12,160
Yeah, I do.

661
01:07:15,470 --> 01:07:17,150
I just don't like it.

662
01:07:25,620 --> 01:07:27,480
I need you to take me back.

663
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,810
There's more I need to find out.

664
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:35,570
Sure.

665
01:07:53,690 --> 01:07:55,090
Dr. Ouelet...

666
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:57,480
What have you told her?

667
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:01,400
She knows.

668
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:04,110
I'm bringing her in.

669
01:08:34,850 --> 01:08:36,720
Hanka security to Headquarters.

670
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:39,580
We have the Major.

671
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:18,260
Why is she sedated?

672
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:21,230
She's been turned by a terrorist.

673
01:09:21,930 --> 01:09:23,640
But you know that already.

674
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:28,950
You should have called
the first time she came to see you.

675
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:32,200
Instead, you gave her information.

676
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:34,980
What makes you think you have
the right to tell me that?

677
01:09:35,010 --> 01:09:36,100
2571 took us close.

678
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,940
It's time to move on
to the next iteration.

679
01:09:38,970 --> 01:09:40,260
2571 isn not a failure.

680
01:09:40,290 --> 01:09:42,450
I will delete all the data
and reprogram her.

681
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:45,660
- She won't remember him at all.
- No, no, no...

682
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:49,080
You download all the data
on the terrorist

683
01:09:49,370 --> 01:09:51,400
and then I order you to terminate.

684
01:09:55,490 --> 01:09:58,050
- What?
- We'll build one that's better.

685
01:09:59,170 --> 01:10:01,950
- I'll delete everything.
- You deleted before.

686
01:10:05,650 --> 01:10:07,450
- She's mine.
- No.

687
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:09,960
She's a contract with me.

688
01:10:10,270 --> 01:10:11,860
We succeeded.

689
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:15,580
She's more than human and more than AI.

690
01:10:15,950 --> 01:10:19,980
We changed her entire identity.
But her ghost survived!

691
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:22,440
Her ghost is what failed us.

692
01:10:23,050 --> 01:10:26,800
We cannot control her.
She's no longer a viable asset.

693
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:34,740
You should be the one to do it.

694
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:45,920
What are you doing to me?

695
01:10:47,690 --> 01:10:50,080
I'll run the standard synaptic.

696
01:10:50,310 --> 01:10:52,470
Upload your data on the raid.

697
01:10:53,430 --> 01:10:56,200
Find out exactly what Kuze told you.

698
01:10:57,190 --> 01:10:59,120
You know what he told me.

699
01:10:59,930 --> 01:11:00,930
The truth.

700
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:06,920
You're deleting everything, aren't you?

701
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:08,250
No.

702
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:12,970
Make it so I don't remember...

703
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:14,940
you.

704
01:11:24,230 --> 01:11:26,880
My name's Major Mira Killian

705
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:31,060
and I do not consent
to the deletion of this data.

706
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:35,360
I do not consent.

707
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:39,820
I do not consent.

708
01:11:40,510 --> 01:11:42,960
We never needed your consent;

709
01:11:46,890 --> 01:11:48,800
yours or anyone's.

710
01:11:53,330 --> 01:11:55,310
You're killing me,

711
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:58,050
aren't you?

712
01:12:18,430 --> 01:12:19,610
Mira?

713
01:12:22,030 --> 01:12:23,340
Can you hear me?

714
01:12:27,330 --> 01:12:28,330
Mira?

715
01:12:31,410 --> 01:12:34,830
This is your past, your real past. Take it.

716
01:12:35,860 --> 01:12:37,500
- Guards!
- Come on, come on!

717
01:12:37,660 --> 01:12:38,950
Come on, go!

718
01:12:46,330 --> 01:12:47,330
Go!

719
01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:48,930
Go!

720
01:12:58,850 --> 01:13:01,460
<i>Security alert on level 25.</i>

721
01:13:02,710 --> 01:13:04,970
<i>Initiating Lockdown procedure.</i>

722
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:08,100
<i>Please relocate to your
designated safe room.</i>

723
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:10,460
<i>Thank you for your cooperation.</i>

724
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:15,810
That's the problem with the human heart.

725
01:13:56,710 --> 01:13:58,460
<i>I want to see her scan.</i>

726
01:13:58,690 --> 01:14:00,710
She killed Dr. Ouelet.

727
01:14:00,930 --> 01:14:04,250
You're to have no further contact with her.
Hanka security will hunt her from here.

728
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:06,640
- What are the orders?
- To terminate on sight.

729
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:08,440
You want to kill her? You built her!

730
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:10,020
Have your sergeant
stand down.

731
01:14:10,050 --> 01:14:11,870
The Major would never
hurt Dr. Ouelet.

732
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:13,820
She's not the Major anymore!

733
01:14:14,140 --> 01:14:16,930
We have a Section 9 operative
under terrorist programming.

734
01:14:17,230 --> 01:14:19,930
This goes public,
your unit goes down.

735
01:14:21,470 --> 01:14:23,320
<i>You kill her,</i>

736
01:14:23,650 --> 01:14:25,430
<i>you kill us.</i>

737
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:27,570
I'll take that under advisement.

738
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:32,890
So what now?

739
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,740
Oh, the poor pumpkin!

740
01:15:29,610 --> 01:15:31,520
Oh, you surprised me.

741
01:15:34,310 --> 01:15:36,060
She likes you.

742
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:38,940
I was looking for...

743
01:15:39,130 --> 01:15:40,130
No, come in.

744
01:15:41,630 --> 01:15:42,970
Yeah, come come.

745
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:50,650
- Can I offer you some tea?
- Okay.

746
01:16:03,150 --> 01:16:05,110
That's Motoko's room.

747
01:16:07,150 --> 01:16:09,120
My daughter died a year ago.

748
01:16:10,490 --> 01:16:11,500
I'm sorry.

749
01:16:11,930 --> 01:16:13,720
She ran away.

750
01:16:14,670 --> 01:16:16,460
She was difficult.

751
01:16:18,350 --> 01:16:20,790
And... we fought.

752
01:16:22,530 --> 01:16:26,110
But I guess we all fight
with our parents, right?

753
01:16:27,610 --> 01:16:29,040
Please come and sit, yeah?

754
01:16:50,390 --> 01:16:52,030
What happened to her?

755
01:16:52,750 --> 01:16:54,480
I don't know.

756
01:16:56,850 --> 01:17:00,850
The Ministry sent me her ashes, and...

757
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:04,800
they told me she took her own life.

758
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:11,320
But Motoko... No, no, no.

759
01:17:11,670 --> 01:17:14,610
I never believe them.

760
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:20,920
She was happy living in the
lawless zone with her friends.

761
01:17:21,730 --> 01:17:25,120
She'd write her manifestos about

762
01:17:26,020 --> 01:17:30,960
how technology was
destroying the world.

763
01:17:32,510 --> 01:17:34,590
Then one day...

764
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:39,060
the police came and they run.

765
01:17:47,130 --> 01:17:48,780
It's strange.

766
01:17:55,570 --> 01:17:59,210
I see her in so many young women.

767
01:18:00,130 --> 01:18:03,300
On the street, in my dreams.

768
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:06,490
As if she's still here.

769
01:18:07,710 --> 01:18:09,180
She was...

770
01:18:10,030 --> 01:18:11,380
fearless.

771
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:15,890
And wild.

772
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:19,000
You remind me of her.

773
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:21,590
Sorry.

774
01:18:26,090 --> 01:18:28,100
How do I remind you of her?

775
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:32,470
The way you look at me.

776
01:18:38,670 --> 01:18:39,910
Who are you?

777
01:18:43,530 --> 01:18:45,050
I don't know.

778
01:18:46,540 --> 01:18:48,200
Wait, wait, wait!

779
01:18:50,210 --> 01:18:52,650
Will you come again to visit me?

780
01:18:54,490 --> 01:18:55,600
I will.

781
01:19:22,010 --> 01:19:23,560
Aramaki.

782
01:19:24,310 --> 01:19:25,500
Listen to me.

783
01:19:26,230 --> 01:19:28,480
I was never in a terrorist bombing.

784
01:19:28,810 --> 01:19:30,190
My parents...

785
01:19:31,020 --> 01:19:33,450
Everything was data,
they installed in my mind.

786
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:38,810
And there were others;
run-aways like me.

787
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:41,410
Considered disposable.

788
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:45,010
Kuze was one of them.
That's why he's coming...

789
01:19:46,050 --> 01:19:47,320
for Hanka.

790
01:19:49,310 --> 01:19:50,530
<i>Can you prove this?</i>

791
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:52,600
Dr. Ouelet can.

792
01:19:53,310 --> 01:19:54,820
<i>Ouelet's dead.</i>

793
01:20:00,630 --> 01:20:02,790
<i>Cutter says you killed her.</i>

794
01:20:07,570 --> 01:20:10,020
Put me on the grid. I need Kuze to find me.

795
01:20:12,450 --> 01:20:13,750
<i>We will be exposed to Cutter.</i>

796
01:20:14,260 --> 01:20:17,060
I know, but I need to do this.

797
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:22,160
<i>I'm going to meet with the Prime Minister.</i>

798
01:20:22,980 --> 01:20:25,160
<i>He must be stopped.</i>

799
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:33,550
The virus has spread.

800
01:20:56,460 --> 01:20:59,220
<i>All agents stick to mental comms.</i>

801
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:43,100
<i>Don't send a rabbit</i>

802
01:21:43,490 --> 01:21:44,490
<i>to kill a fox.</i>

803
01:21:52,850 --> 01:21:54,690
<i>We're burned.</i>

804
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:57,630
<i>I repeat.</i>

805
01:21:58,870 --> 01:22:00,760
<i>We're burned.</i>

806
01:23:02,260 --> 01:23:05,890
We've located Major on the grid.
She's in the lawless zone.

807
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:08,330
Air support 5 minutes out.

808
01:23:09,090 --> 01:23:11,530
Is the spider tank within range?

809
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:15,200
Yes sir. Awaiting your orders sir.

810
01:24:20,260 --> 01:24:21,930
Motoko!

811
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:31,810
It is real.

812
01:25:35,300 --> 01:25:37,100
This place.

813
01:25:44,830 --> 01:25:47,210
I remember what they did to us.

814
01:25:47,620 --> 01:25:52,080
Cutter and his men.
This is where they took us from.

815
01:25:59,110 --> 01:26:00,770
We used to sleep right here.

816
01:26:02,660 --> 01:26:04,590
We were like a family.

817
01:26:04,940 --> 01:26:06,820
All of us run-aways.

818
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:10,010
We had nothing...

819
01:26:13,980 --> 01:26:15,640
except each other.

820
01:26:19,460 --> 01:26:21,810
They took that from us.

821
01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:39,580
Your name was Hideo.

822
01:26:51,060 --> 01:26:52,460
Motoko.

823
01:26:55,140 --> 01:26:56,910
That was your name.

824
01:27:00,490 --> 01:27:01,810
Motoko.

825
01:27:05,740 --> 01:27:07,160
Come with me...

826
01:27:08,460 --> 01:27:10,340
into my network.

827
01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:13,650
We will evolve beyond them.

828
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:19,030
And together we can avenge
what they have done to us.

829
01:27:19,410 --> 01:27:20,410
Come.

830
01:27:20,740 --> 01:27:22,390
With me.

831
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:41,960
I'll take control from here.

832
01:27:42,410 --> 01:27:44,270
<i>Weapons system manual command.</i>

833
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:48,090
<i>Spider tank now active</i>

834
01:27:57,090 --> 01:27:58,970
It's Cutter, he found us!

835
01:29:37,140 --> 01:29:38,350
<i>Target acquired</i>

836
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:41,680
No!

837
01:29:51,180 --> 01:29:53,020
<i>Target eliminated.</i>

838
01:30:08,940 --> 01:30:10,630
You came close...

839
01:30:10,830 --> 01:30:12,190
you freak.

840
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:46,810
<i>Motor center compromised.</i>

841
01:31:30,330 --> 01:31:31,980
Sniper team on site?

842
01:31:32,740 --> 01:31:34,870
Approaching the target now sir.

843
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:38,740
Come with me.

844
01:31:40,150 --> 01:31:43,060
There is no place for us here.

845
01:31:48,050 --> 01:31:49,140
No,

846
01:31:54,930 --> 01:31:57,240
I'm not ready to leave.

847
01:31:58,950 --> 01:32:00,490
I belong here.

848
01:32:04,190 --> 01:32:06,990
I'll always be there with you,

849
01:32:07,970 --> 01:32:09,810
in your ghost.

850
01:32:16,570 --> 01:32:17,570
Target is in view.

851
01:32:18,070 --> 01:32:20,660
What are you waiting for?
DO IT!

852
01:32:22,950 --> 01:32:24,580
No!

853
01:32:25,430 --> 01:32:26,730
Keep firing.

854
01:32:29,390 --> 01:32:31,870
<i>Saito, have you found Major? Is she safe?</i>

855
01:32:34,460 --> 01:32:35,620
She will be.

856
01:32:58,090 --> 01:32:59,170
Hey!

857
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:02,710
Hey.

858
01:33:06,490 --> 01:33:08,450
Say something nice.

859
01:33:09,900 --> 01:33:11,400
What's your name?

860
01:33:11,970 --> 01:33:15,330
Aramaki told me you had a name from before.

861
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:20,950
Motoko.

862
01:33:25,750 --> 01:33:27,720
Major still in there, right?

863
01:33:29,700 --> 01:33:31,120
I am.

864
01:33:47,380 --> 01:33:48,590
<i>Mr. Cutter.</i>

865
01:33:49,930 --> 01:33:51,350
<i>I talked with the Prime Minister.</i>

866
01:33:51,690 --> 01:33:54,950
<i>You're accused of murder
and crimes against the state.</i>

867
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:01,560
I thought that it might be you.

868
01:34:05,610 --> 01:34:07,630
<i>It's unwise to resist.</i>

869
01:34:27,910 --> 01:34:28,910
Please.

870
01:34:29,380 --> 01:34:30,530
<i>Major?</i>

871
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:33,430
<i>I'm with Cutter.</i>

872
01:34:34,170 --> 01:34:36,230
<i>Do you wanna say anything
before I kill him?</i>

873
01:34:37,030 --> 01:34:39,070
Tell him this is justice.

874
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:41,600
It's what I was built for.

875
01:34:42,510 --> 01:34:45,070
So do you give consent?

876
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,650
My name's Major.

877
01:34:48,640 --> 01:34:50,520
And I give my consent.

878
01:36:01,580 --> 01:36:03,930
You don't have to come here anymore.

879
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:08,250
I know.

880
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:45,490
My mind is human.

881
01:36:46,970 --> 01:36:49,040
My body is manufactured.

882
01:36:51,060 --> 01:36:53,020
I'm the first of my kind, but...

883
01:36:54,720 --> 01:36:56,390
I won't be the last.

884
01:37:00,870 --> 01:37:04,180
We cling to memories
as if they define us.

885
01:37:05,370 --> 01:37:08,330
But what we do defines us.

886
01:37:14,730 --> 01:37:17,880
My ghost survived
to remind the next of us

887
01:37:18,730 --> 01:37:21,950
that humanity is our virtue.

888
01:37:23,890 --> 01:37:25,720
I know who I am.

889
01:37:26,470 --> 01:37:28,610
And what I'm here to do.

890
01:37:32,630 --> 01:37:33,940
<i>Major.</i>

891
01:37:34,420 --> 01:37:35,970
<i>Engage targets.</i>

892
01:37:50,500 --> 01:37:52,390
<i>You're authorized.</i>
