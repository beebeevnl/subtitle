00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:53,030
It's ok, just breathe.

9
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,690
Just breathe.

10
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,580
Breathe.

11
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,860
Good.

12
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,780
That's good.

13
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,510
Hello Mira.

14
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,970
I'm Dr. Ouelet.

15
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,250
Do you remember anything
about the attack?

16
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,030
What happened?

17
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,110
I was...
You were drowning.

18
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,900
There was water.

19
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,020
That's right. You were on a boat,

20
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,570
a refugee boat.

21
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,930
It was sunk by terrorists.

22
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,120
Why can't I feel my body?

23
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,430
Mira, your body was damaged.
We could not save that.

24
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:42,000
Only your brain survived.

25
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,600
We made you a new body.

26
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,880
A synthetic shell.

27
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,460
But your mind, your soul...

28
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,150
Your ghost.

29
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,130
It's still in there.

30
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,920
Please.

31
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,380
Sedate her.

32
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,980
Will it work?

33
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,100
Absolutely.

34
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,580
She's a miracle.

35
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:26,570
A machine can't lead,
It can only follow orders.

36
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:29,720
A machine can't imagine or care or intuit.

37
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,350
But as a human mind in
a cybernetic frame...

38
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:36,080
Mira can do all those things, and more.

39
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,220
The first of her kind.

40
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:43,440
She will join Section 9
as soon as she is operational.

41
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,870
Please don't do that.

42
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:49,470
You reducing a complex human to a machine.

43
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,970
I don't think of her as a machine.

44
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,930
She is a weapon.

45
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,890
And the future of my company.

But I embrace change...

63
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:35,260
and enhancement.

64
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,200
Now there is nothing I can't do.

65
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:42,160
Nothing I can't know, nothing I can't be.

66
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,150
Wait and listen to something.

67
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,080
It's my 4 year old daughter.

In the time it took her
to sing that lullaby

69
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,310

71
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,920
There is an echo box up here.

72
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,960
Someone is scanning data traffic.

73
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,520
<i>Keeps track of where it is transmitted.</i>

74
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,800
To see who's worth
this kind of surveillance.

75
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,470
Accessing hotel security network.

76
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:24,350
What're you seeing, sir?
I've got a lot of hotel to scan.

77
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:31,070
<i>There is a banquet room reserved for

79
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:40,360
Got it. 43rd floor.

80
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:44,760
Someone contacted the president staff.
Someone is watching him.

81
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,800
Dr. Osmond...

82
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,690
What is it you want from us?

83
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,900
I think it is more about what
Hanka Robotics can do for you.

84
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:56,670
73% of this world has woken up
to the age of cyber enhancement.

85
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,000

86
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,520
My people embrace cyber enhancement
as do I.

87
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,620
There is no one who really
understand the risk...

88
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:11,050

- Too long.

96
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:45,390
I had heard this speech before
from your competitors.

97
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:49,120
And now Hanka Robotics
serves it with Milky suck.

98

<i>Hey.. hey..</i>

99
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,220

00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,330
You're injured.

109
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,910
You're not the same.

110
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,280
Hey.

111
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:36,560

<i>DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE,

114
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:25,140
So what do we have on Osmond?

115
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,010
So far, very little.

116
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,570
He was the head of Hanka's
robotics division.

117
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:33,200
Human, but of course cyber enhanced.

118
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,000
So how did they hack him?

119
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,870
Somehow this geisha bot
got past his encryption.

120
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,650
Something is different.

121
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,140
What'd you get?

122
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:43,500
Why you always thinking
he's out there enhancing.

123
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,330
Because he is.

124
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,200
A cyber mech liver.

125
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:49,130
Been saving up for a while.

126
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,890
Now it's last call every night.

127
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,390
You got enhanced
so you can drink more?

128
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:57,940
Embrace enhancements, Togusa.
We would not be here without it.

129
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,740
I am all human and happy, thanks.

130
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:04,560
Any more information
about the seized geisha bot?

131
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,220
Hanka is running scans.

132
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:08,710
Dr. Dahlin will have the
reports ready but...

133
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,680
<i>I've been talking to the Prime Minister.</i>

134
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,550
<i>He wants a full report.</i>

135
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,510
<i>Togusa.</i>

136
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,710
Following last night's attack...

137
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:28,880
3 more Hanka's scientists were murdered...

138
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,950
at the company's central laboratory.

139
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,880
The first two were shot...

140
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,720
and the third was beaten to death
by his own service robot.

141
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,810
All showed signs of cerebral hacking.

142
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,600
The same as the geisha did to Osmond.

143
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:49,120
And all were senior figures... in Hanka.

144
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,800
Just like Osmond.

145
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,170
A message was left
at each of the crime scene...

146
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,570
By someone identifying himself...

147
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:01,140
as <i>Kuze.</i>

148
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:05,570
<i>Collaborate with Hanka Robotics

149
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:09,060
<i>Collaborate with Hanka Robotics...</i>

00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,330
<i>and be destroyed.</i>

151

<i>Togusa.</i>

152
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:19,620
<i>You and Ladriya go speak to Mr. Cutter,

153
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,530
<i>Major and Batou

154
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:28,980
<i>Find out what has been
recovered from the geisha.</i>

155
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,800
<i>Major!</i>

156
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,480
<i>I told you not jump off.</i>

157
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:51,370
I had to, or more would have died.

158
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:56,060
<i>You are a member of my team,
and my responsibility</i>

159
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,990
I'll find him... and I will kill him.

160
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:03,830
It's what I am built for, isn't it?

161
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:12,680
<i>You are more than just a weapon.</i>

162
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:16,560
<i>You have a soul, a ghost.</i>

163
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:21,740
<i>When we see our uniqueness as a virtue...</i>

164
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,830
<i>Only then will we find peace.</i>

165
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,660
<i>Safely reconfiguring the

166
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,280
<i>Families built better.</i>

167
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,770
What was going on with you
at the hotel last night?

168
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,230
Nothing. I'm fine.

169
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,650
You sure?

170
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:44,230
<i>- Hey, sweetheart, want an upgrade?
- Move.</i>

171
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:46,430
<i>- I have anything you want.
- Back off!</i>

172
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:50,710
Hey, Ming!

173
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:51,830
Hey, Batou!

174
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,430
- Got your bones.
- Thanks man.

175
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,470
For the dogs.

176
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:03,450
For someone who doesn't like people
How come you care about dogs so much?

177
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,320
I dont know. I like just strays
and they like me.

178
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:08,380
They like you because you feed them.

179
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,680
You got no heart.

180
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,580
Hey, girls!

181
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,500
Hey Gabriel!

182
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,940
Meet Major.

183
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,830
Major, Gabriel.

184
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,700
We used to have a dog.

185
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,190
Seriously?

186
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:37,810
I had you down as more of a cat person.

187
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:44,480
You don't talk about that stuff.

188
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,760
What?

189
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:48,730
- Your past.
- I don't remember much.

190
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,700
Just fragments, bits and pieces.

191
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:54,070
What about family?

192
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,710
My parents, they died
bringing us to this country.

193
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:58,460
Our boat sank in the harbor.

194
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,700
I almost drowned.

195
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,880
I feel it's like...

196
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,370
there is always this thick fog
over my memory.

197
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:07,870
And I can't seen through it.

198
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,270
You are lucky.

199
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:13,190
Every single day I get
screwed upon my memory.

200
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,880
It's better to be pure.

201
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:16,800
Like you.

202
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,290
<i>HANKA CENTRAL OFFICE OF ROBOTICS</i>

203
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,600

206
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,970
Your have damaged internal systems.

207
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,610
Maybe next time you can design me better.

208
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,590
- How are you?
- I am fine. I can't feel anything.

209
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:04,530
No you, in There.

210
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,100
I have been having glitches...

211
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,310
It will pass.

212
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:13,340
- Have you been taking your medication?
- Yeah.

213
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,930
But these ones are so cycling.
I had two this morning.

214
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,620
- Sound or image?
- Both.

215
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,950
I see it.

216
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,070
You made any unencrypted downloads?

217
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,610
- No. Just delete them from me.
- Consent?

218
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,740
My name is Major Mary Killian.
I give my consent to delete this data.

219
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,310
It's done.

220
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,260
- No big deal.
- What are they?

221
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:42,720
Sensory echoes from your mind, shadows.

222
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:44,070
I'm not sure.

223
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,100
How do you know what's a glitch
and what's me?

224
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,120
The glitches have a different texture...

225
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,390
to the rest of your code.

226
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,200
I can see everything.

227
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,890
All of your thoughts, your... decisions.

228
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:02,210
I guess privacy is just for humans.

229
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:04,130
You are human.

230
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,260
People see you as human.

231
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:09,800
Everyone around me seems to fit.

232
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:13,610
They seem connected to something.
Something I...

233
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,350
am not..

234
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:19,940
- Like I have no past.
- Of course you have a past.

235
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:23,640
And at time you'll feel more more
connected to it and to them.

236
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:29,270
Opens and close, please.

237
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,420
We cling to memories
as if they define us, but...

238
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,280
They really don't.

239
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:48,060
What we do is what defines us.

240
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:54,670
<i>You're entering a Hanka secure area.

<i>Please disable communication enhancement.</i>

242
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,250
I'm busy.

243
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,870
Dr.. Dahlin! Are you finished yet?

244
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:05,290
If you hadn't riddled the Geisha
with bullets,

245
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,400
This would be much easier.

246
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:09,010
- I didn't shoot him.
- I did.

247
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,240
This is gonna take days.

248
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,160
I need to run hundreds
of potential simulations.

249
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,520
We don't have the time.

250
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,790
She was a Hanka companion bot.

251
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,360
But she was reprogrammed
for cerebral hacking.

252
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,160
What was on her drives?

253
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:34,160
Nothing. The data was destroyed
as it was transmitted.

254
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,230
No sign of what she was up to.

255
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,780
The hardware was vandalized.

256
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,150
They ripped her up.

257
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:43,440
Then I have to do a deep dive.

258
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,420
You can't encrypt during a deep dive

259
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:48,060
I know it.

260
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:53,940
They could left traps in her.
Mag pulses, viruses.

261
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,380
She is right.

262
00:24:55,970 --> 00:25:00,190
You will be exposing your mind to
who ever hacked her. You'll be wide open.

263
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:07,710
I have to get inside her memory.
It's the fastest way to find Kuze.

264
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,110
It's too dangerous.

265
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,800
And highly irresponsible.

266
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,100
Are you sure?

267
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,770
You see any bad code headed my way,
pull me out.

268
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,510
How come you're the one sweating?

269
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:41,750
Run it.

270
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:53,720
Cyber mind connection to the Major,
now active...

271
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,730
and unencrypted

272
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,350
consent required for data download.

273
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:02,770
My name is Major Mira Killian
and I give my consent.

274
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,870
Disconnect. Get her out.

275
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,350
- Get her out!
- I'm trying, but she's being hacked.

276
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,650
Get her out now!

277
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,910
Now!

278
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,070
Are you okay?

279
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,610
I know where he is.

280
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,190
I know this place.

281
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:23,170
They run black market mech,

282
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:26,370
- You tooled up..?
- Yep.

283
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:28,610
Target's in the basement,
I'll lead.

284
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:30,070
Switching in my comms.

285
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,740
- Hope you've been practicing.
- That's unfair.

286
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:37,180
Just takes me a moment to,

287
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:38,860
Get the hang of it.

288
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,390
Two mercs at the doors.
Armed and enhanced.

289
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,210
Copy that. We got it covered.

290
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,840
There's a lot of heat in here
for a nightclub.

291
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:11,310
It's a Yakuza club. What did you expect?

292
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:13,110
I quite like the place.

293
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:15,390
Why doesn't that surprise me?

294
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:20,260
I am gonna have to draw some attention.
See if I can access the basement that way.

295
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:26,350
You're not here
looking for any trouble, are you?

296
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:29,440
I am just here for the girls... and beer.

297
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,320
- Can I help you?
- I am looking for someone.

298
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,860
You've been here before?

299
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:39,480
My friend had some mech work done here.
Industry stuff.

300
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:41,390
We don't do mech work here.

301
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,450
My mistake.

302
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:47,390
Why don't you come have fun with us?
We will have some privacy.

303
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,620
I'm in.

304
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,800
I'll be here when you need me.

305
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:15,480
- You say your friend worked here?
- I said my friend had work done here.

306
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,950
She's human?

307
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,970
Your friend.

308
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,520
Now what's that supposed to mean?

309
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:23,850
Batou.

310
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,300
Can you hear me?

311
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:29,340
Who did this stunning work on you?

312
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,380
It is divine.

313
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,610
Ladriya... guns.

314
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,860
Here.

315
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,550
Batou, I'm losing signal.

316
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,850
Don't worry sweety.

317
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,330
We have privacy.

318
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,140
Listen.

319
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,900
No signal is going in or out.

320
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,530
Major, I'm in position. Do you copy?

321
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,740
Beer.

322
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:06,950
If you don't answer,
you're gonna hurt my feelings.

323
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:17,140
Ladriya, do you have major on Comms?

324
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,940
Got nothing. The signal is still blocked.

325
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:23,170
I am afraid I get bored
rather easily, so...

326
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,440
You don't wanna talk...

327
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,400
Maybe you wanna dance!

328
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,840
Major, come on. Answer me.

329
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,750
I thought you said no trouble.

330
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:53,850
Dance!

331
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:01,700
The truth is...

332
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:04,990
I wasn't built to dance.

333
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:01,920
Back on comms.
I am heading to the back room.

334
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:05,890
I missed you. I'll meet you there.

335
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,590
<i>Collaborate with Hanka Robotics
and be destroyed.</i>

336
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:52,390
Major?

337
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,890
Where is Batou?

338
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,710
In enhancement, next door.
He is doing well

339
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:34,770
you took most of the blast.

340
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,650
I saw him down there.

341
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:42,820
It was like...

342
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,380
He waited to see me.

343
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,020
We synaptic scanned you.

344
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,660
Everything you witnessed
went to Section 9 to evaluate.

345
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,230
You know, the scan...

346
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,820
Also turned up the number of glitches.

347
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,550
They've been getting worse.

348
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,680
Since when?

349
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,270
Since the deep dive.

350
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:27,530
Do any of the glitches
mean something to you?

351
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:30,050
No.

352
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,220
They don't.

353
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:37,240
You have been inside
the same shell as he has.

354
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:41,770
That could have very serious consequences.

355
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,930
You were not authorized
to deep dive the geisha.

356
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,790
You're disappointed.

357
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:52,020
No, I'm worried.

358
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,350
You're not invulnerable.

359
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:00,900
I can repair your body,
but I can't protect your mind.

360
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,000
Why not?

361
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,750
You can see all my thoughts so...

362
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,200
You should be able to secure them.

363
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,610
Try and understand your importance Mira.

364
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:21,590
You're what everyone will become one day.

365
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:27,120
You don't know how alone
that makes me feel.

366
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,850
I can see you out there, you know.

367
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:51,540
How many fingers am I holding up?

368
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:53,830
Funny.

369
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:04,940
Say something nice.

370
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,040
You chose those?

371
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,970
They are tactical.

372
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:14,040
- Always for the job.
- What else I got?

373
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,540
- They suit you.
- Yeah?

374
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:19,370
I got night vision,...

375
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,670
and X-rays.

376
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:24,500
I guess I see like you now.

377
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:27,630
Don't worry, you'll get used to it.

378
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:31,900
Thanks for saving my ass.

379
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,770
Glad to see you're okay..

380
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,120
Major?

381
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,430
Could you feed the dogs for me?

382
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:43,520
I don't wanna scare them.

383
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,120
Anytime.

384
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:32,060
Are you insufficiently funded, Mr. Aramaki?

385
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:35,950
Is section 9 missing some
critical operational resource?

386
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,150
<i>We have everything that we require.</i>

387
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:43,700
Major is our most sophisticated weapon
only if she is intact.

388
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:47,070
And Dr. Ouelet informed me...

389
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:50,220
That you let her dive a corrupted geisha.

390
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,700
You realize there is a premium importance

391
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,550
that Hanka represents to this government.

392
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:06,260
Major is the is the future of my company.

393
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,660
If you compromise your systems again...

394
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:12,280
I will burn this section.

395
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:17,150
<i>Yes sir.</i>

396
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,510
<i>Mr. Cutter.</i>

397
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:23,200
<i>Be careful who is the threat.</i>

398
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:27,360
<i>I am accountable to the Prime Minister,
not to Hanka.</i>

399
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:17,130

Beauty enhanced.</i>

400
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:29,400
Are you human?

401
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:31,990
Yeah.

402
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,500
Can you take that off?

403
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:42,180
So I can see your face?

404
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:09,470
What does that feel like?

405
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:10,860
It feels...

406
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,720
different.

407
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:25,790
What are you?

408
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:44,440
<i>SECURE PROJECT 2571</i>

409
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:55,150
<i>HANKA PERSONNEL FILES</i>

410
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:03,850
Look at me.

411
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:09,160
Tell me what they took from me.

412
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:14,260
I am sorry. They never told us.

413
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:39,250
It feels weird driving with these eyes.

414
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:44,400
Why do you take that?

415
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,700
Um, keeps my brain from rejecting this body.

416
00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:52,050
Major, Batou, you need to get here.

417
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:53,390
What you got?

418
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:56,020
Another Hanka scientist
has been found dead.

419
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,590
It's Dahlin.

420
00:42:58,110 --> 00:42:59,110
Got it.

421
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:07,920
Major this way.

422
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:37,430
<i>SECURE - PROJECT 2571</i>

423
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:39,090
What is that?

424
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:42,860
She found what Kuze stole from Osmond.

425
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:48,420
It's a list of everyone
who worked on a project called 2571.

426
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:50,420
That's who he's targeting.

427
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:52,720
Is there anyone else on that list?

428
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:55,330
<i>Dr. OUELET</i>

429
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,930
Find Oulet. Now!

430
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:01,100
She is in transit. Her comms are down.

431
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,810
<i>I'm looking at her and I'm thinking...</i>

432
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:10,270
<i>"You want me to for pay for violin too".</i>

433
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:11,850
<i>Don't get me wrong.</i>

434
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:14,530
<i>I love that kid to pieces.</i>

435
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:16,720
<i>I do. She is amazing.</i>

436
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,950
<i>But when she practices that thing,
it's painful right?</i>

437
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:22,030
<i>Why not piano?</i>

438
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:26,830
<i>I mean, it's the same price, you know.
And doesn't sound so bad.</i>

439
00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:31,530
<i>At least if you can't play that proper,
it sounds...</i>

00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:23,490
<i>2-5-7-1!
Tell me everything!</i>

441
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:37,460
<i>Are you prepare

442
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:47,570
Go!

443
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:03,630
Go!

444
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:02,540
Who is Kuze?

445
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,290
- Why does he want to kill Ouelet?
- I don't know anything.

446
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,010
Enough, enough!

447
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:13,620
We need him alive.

448
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,090
Please. I have been trough this.

449
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,260
You have the wrong guy.

450
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:26,800
So tell us who we do have.

451
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:31,580
My name is Lee Cunningham.

452
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,260
- Where'd you get the weapons?
- I don't know.

453
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,170
Who loaded the mines?

454
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:40,680
I don't know anything about the weapons,
alright I told you.

455
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,370
I was picking up my daughter.
She takes violin lessons.

456
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:45,040
What's her name?

457
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,140
- Is this her?
- Yeah.

458
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:52,780
Isn't she a little angel?

459
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:55,020
- This is your daughter?
- Right.

460
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:59,240
Do you have that?

461
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:04,060
Where do you live?

462
00:49:06,350 --> 00:49:07,660
I can't remember.

463
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:10,960
I think it's a tall place.
Is it a tall building?

464
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:13,060
It's a tall place, right?

465
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,970
You don't have a child.

466
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:22,150
You have no wife. You live alone,
It's just you.

467
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:23,900
- What? No.
- We went to your apartment.

468
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:25,330
- There was nobody there.
- No.

469
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:26,950
You live there for
10 years by yourself.

470
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:27,220
No.

471
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:29,620
- You're just lying.
- I'm not lying.

472
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,290
I didn't kill anyone!

473
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:34,810
- Why do you keep doing this to me?
- Holocube disconnect.

474
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,240
Please!

475
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:38,950
I didn't do anything.

476
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:41,790
Why do you keep saying this to me?

477
00:49:41,990 --> 00:49:43,840
I don't understand.
How can he not know?

478
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:47,920
The hack must have created a vacuum.
Kuze's wiped his memory...

479
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,850
and somehow installed a new reality.

480
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:54,640
At least he got to believe he had a kid.

481
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,410
What's the difference huh?

482
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,910
Fantasy, reality?

483
00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:03,090
Dreams, memories?

484
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:05,720
It's all the same.

485
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:08,080
Just noise.

486
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,080
It's him.

487
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,610
He is in there.

488
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:20,840
This cube is secure.
He can't be, Major.

489
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:22,560
Lie Detector.

490
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:23,770
He must have hacked in that way.

491
00:50:23,930 --> 00:50:26,780
We should uplink to the machine,
trace the code, get a lock on his location.

492
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:28,160
Do it.

493
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:30,630
Don't go in there.
It's too dangerous.

494
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:32,760
<i>Major</i>

495
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:35,680
<i>We don't know what else he can do.</i>

496
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:49,990
The signal is unstable.
Can you get the lock on him?

497
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:52,360
We gotta move fast. We're losing him.

498
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:53,780
Connecting.

499
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,730
Who are you?

500
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,030
Come here.

501
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,730
I'm shy.

502
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:09,070
I'm not beautiful...

503
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:10,580
like you.

504
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,580
Tell me who you are.

505
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:18,800
I have been born more than once.

506
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:22,070
So I have more than one name

507
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,120
I'll find you.

508
00:51:24,610 --> 00:51:26,060
Not yet.

509
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:28,240
I am not done.

510
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:30,620
The machine is tracing his location.

511
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:32,200
We got a fix!

512
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:39,500
I need to see her.

513
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,540
No Please. I know..what...

514
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:42,990
We got him.

515
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:52,310
Let's go.

516
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:08,020
Weapons up.

517
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,240
- Go.
- On me.

518
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:02,150
Stay Down! Stay Down!

519
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:13,850
Put it down, put it down.

520
00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:22,470
Grenade!

521
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:20,360
Major!

522
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:22,170
Come in.

523
00:54:23,410 --> 00:54:25,430
I know why we could not find him.

524
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:31,510
He is using human minds
to create a network of his own.

525
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:33,150
We're coming to your position.

526
00:55:48,390 --> 00:55:50,220
Tell me who you are.

527
00:55:52,770 --> 00:55:57,090
I'm that what you seek to destroy.

528
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:03,370
In this life, my name is...

529
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:05,480
Kuze.

530
00:56:08,290 --> 00:56:10,140
What are you doing to me?

531
00:56:13,090 --> 00:56:18,000
I have, connected you,
to a network of my own creation.

532
00:56:18,450 --> 00:56:20,680
When I am finished in this world...

533
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:25,350
my ghost can survive
there and regenerate.

534
00:56:25,810 --> 00:56:27,970
What do you want from me?

535
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:30,610
I became...

536
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:33,890
Fascinated with you...

537
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:37,170
Reading your code...

538
00:56:37,530 --> 00:56:40,070
when you were inside that geisha.

539
00:56:42,610 --> 00:56:46,250
Like nothing I had felt before,
yet so..

540
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:48,440
Familiar.

541
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:52,820
We are the same.

542
00:56:53,330 --> 00:56:54,940
We are not the same.

543
00:56:57,650 --> 00:56:59,580
You kill innocent people.

544
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,700
Innocent? Is that the..what you call them?

545
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:05,850
I am as they need me.

546
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:08,410
Who made you?

547
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:10,620
What have they told you?

548
00:57:11,130 --> 00:57:13,250
That you were the first?

549
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:16,180
The first cerebral salvage.

550
00:57:17,450 --> 00:57:20,800
You were born of lessons...
they took.

551
00:57:21,210 --> 00:57:22,690
from my failure.

552
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,360
What are you talking about?

553
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:32,750
I was conscious while they
dismembered my body, and discarded me

554
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:35,020
like garbage.

555
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:38,670
I was lying on a table...

556
00:57:39,050 --> 00:57:43,910
Listening to doctors talk about how
my mind had not meshed with the shell.

557
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:46,260
That they had built.

558
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:50,570
how project t-two, five, seven, one..

559
00:57:51,070 --> 00:57:52,360
had failed...

560
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,040
and they had to move on...

561
00:58:01,350 --> 00:58:02,530
to you.

562
00:58:09,810 --> 00:58:12,150
What a beauty you are.

563
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,720
They have improved us so much...

564
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:19,850
since they made me.

565
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:27,170
They thought that we would be
a part of their evolution.

566
00:58:27,310 --> 00:58:29,850
But they have created us...

567
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:32,550
to evolve alone...

568
00:58:37,450 --> 00:58:38,810
beyond them.

569
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:41,790
Evolution? That's what you call?

570
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:44,540
Killing everyone who made you?

571
00:58:44,990 --> 00:58:47,250
You are not listening to me.

572
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:49,350
You are murderer.

573
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:52,650
They tried to kill me first.

574
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:56,410
It is self-defense.

575
00:58:56,730 --> 00:58:58,590
The defense of self.

576
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:03,000
More will die...

577
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:07,050
until they tell me...

578
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:09,060
what they took.

579
00:59:09,310 --> 00:59:10,650
I won't let that happen.

580
00:59:12,990 --> 00:59:14,530
You want to kill me?

581
00:59:19,050 --> 00:59:21,000
Like everyone else.

582
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:28,990
Do it, then.

583
00:59:32,370 --> 00:59:34,450
Do what you were programmed to do.

584
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:47,630
What is that?

585
00:59:59,770 --> 01:00:01,340
What is that?

586
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:06,830
I c-c-can't remember,
but I am haunted by it.

587
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:09,630
Do You see it?

588
01:00:15,210 --> 01:00:16,210
Togusa!

589
01:00:21,230 --> 01:00:25,410
Don't take the medication
that they gave you..

590
01:00:26,050 --> 01:00:28,800
They use it to suppress your memories.

591
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:33,100
Your shell belongs to them,
but not your ghost.

592
01:00:33,850 --> 01:00:35,550
Your ghost is yours.

593
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:37,600
Remember that...

594
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:40,790
and maybe you can remember it all.

595
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:51,550
Get away from her!
Get down on the ground now.

596
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:58,820
Major..

597
01:01:07,750 --> 01:01:09,580
Major!

598
01:02:11,590 --> 01:02:12,900
How many?

599
01:02:16,790 --> 01:02:18,110
Dozens.

600
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:25,180
How manyï?

601
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:31,500
98 unsuccessful attempts before you.

602
01:02:33,940 --> 01:02:36,080
You killed 98 innocent people.

603
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:38,730
No, I didn't kill anyone.

604
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:41,040
You wouldn't be here.

605
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:44,190
You would not exist if it
weren't for those experiments.

606
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:46,000
Experiments?

607
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:50,090
- Is that what I am to you?
- No!

608
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:53,770
No, Mira!

609
01:02:59,180 --> 01:03:01,130
Sacrifices were made.

610
01:03:03,630 --> 01:03:05,610
Where did the bodies come from?

611
01:03:08,030 --> 01:03:09,700
Where did I come from?

612
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:13,400
Mr. Cutter brought them to us.

613
01:03:13,830 --> 01:03:15,660
I did not ask questions.

614
01:03:16,030 --> 01:03:17,250
The harbor.

615
01:03:18,070 --> 01:03:19,570
My parents.

616
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:21,920
The way they died.

617
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:25,310
Did that happen?

618
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:29,620
No.

619
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:35,180
We gave you false memories.

620
01:03:36,450 --> 01:03:38,200
Cutter wanted to motivate you.

621
01:03:38,770 --> 01:03:41,050
To fight terrorists.
I didn't approve.

622
01:03:41,390 --> 01:03:44,800
It was cruel, but my work,
that was important, and...

623
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:47,060
you were born.

624
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:50,330
You were so beautiful.

625
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:54,610
Nothing I have is real.

626
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:59,100
I found him.

627
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:01,480
I told you to be careful.

628
01:04:01,850 --> 01:04:04,460
You knew who he was the whole time.

629
01:04:04,770 --> 01:04:05,930
You built him.

630
01:04:07,470 --> 01:04:08,770
He had a..

631
01:04:09,730 --> 01:04:11,760
Violent unstable mind.

632
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:14,990
His cerebral connection wouldn't hold!

633
01:04:15,430 --> 01:04:17,560
- I tried to save him!
- No.

634
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:20,060
You left him to die.

635
01:04:31,110 --> 01:04:34,710
<i>Nothing on Kuze yet, sir.
Checking upper zones next.</i>

636
01:04:36,210 --> 01:04:37,930
Is there any word on Major?

637
01:04:38,810 --> 01:04:42,530
<i>She's gone.
Off-grid. Silent.</i>

638
01:04:43,830 --> 01:04:45,570
Copy that, sir.

639
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:47,900
I know where to find her.

640
01:05:31,770 --> 01:05:33,660
I didn't ask you to come here.

641
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:36,320
You never ask.

642
01:05:37,050 --> 01:05:38,630
But I always do.

643
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:44,950
Did they send you to bring me in?

644
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:49,410
I'm just here to fish. Did you see any?

645
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:54,220
You are a company man, you follow orders.
So, if they ordered you to kill me..

646
01:05:54,510 --> 01:05:57,340
Stop saying shit like that.
You're gonna piss me off.

647
01:06:20,130 --> 01:06:21,790
What's it like down there?

648
01:06:23,530 --> 01:06:25,290
It's Cold and dark.

649
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:28,650
Just a million miles away.

650
01:06:29,930 --> 01:06:31,460
No voices.

651
01:06:32,370 --> 01:06:33,980
No data streaming.

652
01:06:35,350 --> 01:06:36,350
Just...

653
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:40,900
nothing.

654
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:48,360
- It scares me.
- Then Why do you do it?

655
01:06:55,350 --> 01:06:56,790
It feels real.

656
01:06:57,770 --> 01:06:59,660
Why didn't you stop him?

657
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:05,020
I don't know who to trust anymore.

658
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:07,730
You trust me, right?

659
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:13,670
Yes I do.

660
01:07:16,970 --> 01:07:18,650
I just don't like it.

661
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:28,990
I need you to take me back.

662
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:31,110
There is more I need to find out.

663
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:36,870
Sure.

664
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,390
Dr. Ouelet...

665
01:07:57,260 --> 01:07:58,780
What have you told her?

666
01:08:01,230 --> 01:08:02,710
She knows.

667
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:05,410
I'm bringing her in.

668
01:08:36,150 --> 01:08:38,020
Hanka security to Headquarters.

669
01:08:39,130 --> 01:08:40,880
We have the Major.

670
01:09:18,150 --> 01:09:19,660
Why is she sedated?

671
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:22,640
She's been turned by a terrorist.

672
01:09:23,630 --> 01:09:25,340
But you know that already.

673
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:30,660
You should have called
the first time she came to see you.

674
01:09:32,150 --> 01:09:33,660
Instead, you gave
her information.

675
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:35,040
What makes you think you have the..

676
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:37,810
- Right to tell me that?
- 2-5-7-1 took us close.

677
01:09:38,710 --> 01:09:40,430
It's time to move on to the next iteration.

678
01:09:40,710 --> 01:09:41,970
2-5-7-1 is not a failure.

679
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,160
I will delete all the
data and reprogram her.

680
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:47,370
- She won't remember him at all.
- No, no, no, no.

681
01:09:47,860 --> 01:09:50,780
You download all the data
on the terrorist...

682
01:09:51,070 --> 01:09:53,100
and then I order you to terminate.

683
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:59,750
- What?
- We'll build one that's better.

684
01:10:00,870 --> 01:10:03,650
- I'll delete everything.
- You deleted before.

685
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:09,150
- She's mine.
- No.

686
01:10:09,510 --> 01:10:11,660
She is a contract... with me.

687
01:10:11,980 --> 01:10:13,560
We succeeded.

688
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:17,280
She is more than human... and more than AI.

689
01:10:17,650 --> 01:10:21,680
We change her entire identity.
But her ghost survived!

690
01:10:21,990 --> 01:10:24,140
Her ghost is what failed us.

691
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:28,200
We can not control her.
She is no longer a viable asset.

692
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:36,050
You should be the one to do it.

693
01:10:45,690 --> 01:10:47,630
What are you doing to me?

694
01:10:49,390 --> 01:10:51,780
I'll run the standard synaptic.

695
01:10:52,010 --> 01:10:54,180
Upload your data on the raid.

696
01:10:55,140 --> 01:10:57,910
I'll find out exactly what Kuze told you.

697
01:10:58,890 --> 01:11:00,830
You know what he told me.

698
01:11:01,630 --> 01:11:02,630
The truth.

699
01:11:06,330 --> 01:11:08,620
You're deleting everything, aren't you?

700
01:11:08,950 --> 01:11:09,950
No.

701
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:14,680
So I don't remember...

702
01:11:15,540 --> 01:11:16,640
You.

703
01:11:25,940 --> 01:11:28,580
My name is Major Mira Killian...

704
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:32,770
And I do not consent
to the deletion of this data.

705
01:11:34,610 --> 01:11:37,060
I do not consent.

706
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:41,530
I do not consent.

707
01:11:42,210 --> 01:11:44,670
We never needed your consent.

708
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:50,500
Yours or anyoneâ€™s.

709
01:11:55,030 --> 01:11:57,010
You're killing me..

710
01:11:58,300 --> 01:11:59,750
Right you..?

711
01:12:19,180 --> 01:12:20,360
Mira?

712
01:12:22,790 --> 01:12:24,100
Do you hear me?

713
01:12:28,090 --> 01:12:29,090
Mira?

714
01:12:32,270 --> 01:12:35,080
This is your past, your real past. Take it.

715
01:12:36,610 --> 01:12:38,250
- Guards!
- Come on, come on!

716
01:12:38,410 --> 01:12:39,710
Come on, go!

717
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:48,080
Go!

718
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:49,680
Go!

719
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:02,410
<i>Security alert on level 25.</i>

723
01:13:13,990 --> 01:13:16,360
That's the problem with the human heart.

724
01:13:57,660 --> 01:13:59,420
<i>I want to see her scan.</i>

725
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:01,370
She killed Dr. Ouelet.

726
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:05,400
You are to have no further contact with her.
Hanka security will hunt her from here.

727
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:07,800
- What are the orders?
- To terminate on sight.

728
01:14:08,060 --> 01:14:09,600
You want to kill her? You built her!

729
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:13,030
- Have your sergeant stand down.
- The Major would never hurt Dr. Oulete.

730
01:14:13,330 --> 01:14:14,980
She is not the major anymore!

731
01:14:15,290 --> 01:14:18,080
We have a section 9 operative
under terrorist programming.

732
01:14:18,390 --> 01:14:21,090
This goes public your unit goes down.

733
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:24,480
<i>You kill her...</i>

734
01:14:24,810 --> 01:14:26,580
<i>You kill us.</i>

735
01:14:26,710 --> 01:14:28,730
I'll take that under advice.

736
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:34,040
So what now?

737
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:29,900
Oh, the pup pumpkin.

738
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:32,670
Oh, you surprised me.

739
01:15:35,470 --> 01:15:37,210
She likes you.

740
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,090
I was looking for...

741
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:41,280
No, come in.

742
01:15:42,790 --> 01:15:44,130
Yeah, go, come come.

743
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:52,800
- Can I offer you some tea?
- Okay.

744
01:15:56,270 --> 01:16:03,270
<i>P s a g m e n o . com</i>

745
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:06,260
That... Motoko's room.

746
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:10,280
My daughter died a year ago.

747
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:12,650
I am Sorry.

748
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:14,870
She run away.

749
01:16:15,830 --> 01:16:17,610
She was a difficult.

750
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:21,940
We fought.

751
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:27,260
But I guess we all fight
with our parents, right?

752
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:30,190
Please come on the sit.

753
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:53,180
What happened to your her?

754
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:55,640
I don't know.

755
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:02,000
The ministry sent me her ashes, and...

756
01:17:03,210 --> 01:17:05,960
They told me she took her own life.

757
01:17:09,190 --> 01:17:12,470
But Motoko... No, no, no.

758
01:17:12,820 --> 01:17:15,760
I never believe them.

759
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:18,330
She was happy...

760
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:22,070
living in the lawless
zone with her friends.

761
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:26,270
She'd write her manifestos about...

762
01:17:27,180 --> 01:17:29,040
how technology was...

763
01:17:29,530 --> 01:17:32,110
destroying the world.

764
01:17:33,670 --> 01:17:35,740
Then one day...

765
01:17:36,190 --> 01:17:38,150
the police came...

766
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,220
and they run.

767
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:49,930
It's strange.

768
01:17:56,720 --> 01:18:00,360
I see her in so many young women.

769
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:04,460
On the street, in my dreams.

770
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,640
As if she is still here.

771
01:18:08,860 --> 01:18:10,340
She was...

772
01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:12,530
fearless.

773
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:17,040
And wild.

774
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:20,160
You remind me of her.

775
01:18:21,670 --> 01:18:22,740
Sorry.

776
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:29,260
How do I remind you of her?

777
01:18:31,310 --> 01:18:33,620
The way you look at me.

778
01:18:39,830 --> 01:18:41,070
Who are you?

779
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:46,200
I don't know.

780
01:18:47,690 --> 01:18:49,360
Wait, wait, wait!

781
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:53,800
Will you come again to visit me?

782
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:56,760
I will.

783
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:24,710
Aramaki.

784
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:26,660
Listen to me.

785
01:19:27,380 --> 01:19:29,630
I was never in a terrorist bombing.

786
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:31,340
My parents...

787
01:19:32,170 --> 01:19:34,610
Everything was data
they installed in my mind.

788
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:39,970
And there were others.
Run-aways like me...

789
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:42,570
considered disposable.

790
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:46,160
Kuze was one of them.
That's why he's coming.

791
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:48,470
For Hanka.

792
01:19:50,470 --> 01:19:51,690
<i>Can you prove this?</i>

793
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:53,760
Dr. Ouelet can.

794
01:19:54,460 --> 01:19:55,970
<i>Ouelet's dead.</i>

795
01:20:01,790 --> 01:20:03,950
<i>Cutter says you killed her.</i>

796
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:11,170
Put me on the grid. I need Kuze to find me.

797
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:14,900
<i>We will be exposed to Cutter.</i>

798
01:20:15,410 --> 01:20:18,210
I know, but I have to do this.

799
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:23,320
<i>I'm going to meet with the Prime Minister.</i>

800
01:20:24,130 --> 01:20:26,310
<i>He must be stopped.</i>

801
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:34,700
The virus has spread.

802
01:20:57,610 --> 01:21:00,380
<i>All agents stick to mental comms.</i>

803
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:44,250
<i>Don't send a rabbit...</i>

804
01:21:44,650 --> 01:21:45,650
<i>to kill a fox.</i>

805
01:21:54,010 --> 01:21:55,850
<i>We are burned.</i>

806
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:58,780
<i>I repeat.</i>

807
01:22:00,030 --> 01:22:01,910
<i>We are burned.</i>

808
01:23:03,620 --> 01:23:07,240
We have located Major on the grid.
She's in the lawless zone.

809
01:23:07,690 --> 01:23:09,680
Air support 5 minutes out.

810
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:12,880
Is the spider tank within range?

811
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:16,560
Yes sir. Awaiting your orders sir.

812
01:24:21,210 --> 01:24:22,880
Motoko!

813
01:25:31,230 --> 01:25:32,770
It is real.

814
01:25:36,260 --> 01:25:38,060
This place.

815
01:25:45,790 --> 01:25:48,170
I remember what they did to us.

816
01:25:48,570 --> 01:25:53,040
Cutter and his men.
This is where they took us from.

817
01:26:00,070 --> 01:26:01,730
We used to sleep right here.

818
01:26:03,610 --> 01:26:05,550
We were like a family.

819
01:26:05,890 --> 01:26:07,780
All of us run away.

820
01:26:09,410 --> 01:26:10,960
We had nothing...

821
01:26:14,930 --> 01:26:16,590
except each other.

822
01:26:20,410 --> 01:26:22,260
They took that from us.

823
01:26:38,670 --> 01:26:40,540
Your name was Hideo.

824
01:26:52,010 --> 01:26:53,410
Motoko.

825
01:26:56,100 --> 01:26:57,870
That was your name.

826
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:02,760
Motoko.

827
01:27:06,690 --> 01:27:08,110
Come with me...

828
01:27:09,410 --> 01:27:11,290
into my network.

829
01:27:12,190 --> 01:27:14,610
We will evolve beyond them.

830
01:27:15,390 --> 01:27:19,990
And together we can avenge
what they have done to us.

831
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:21,760
Come...

832
01:27:22,090 --> 01:27:23,750
with me.

833
01:27:41,790 --> 01:27:43,320
I will take control from here.

834
01:27:43,770 --> 01:27:45,630
<i>Weapons system manual command.</i>

835
01:27:47,080 --> 01:27:49,440
<i>Spider tank now active</i>

836
01:27:58,450 --> 01:28:00,320
It's Cutter! He found us!

837
01:29:38,690 --> 01:29:39,900
<i>Target acquired</i>

838
01:29:42,190 --> 01:29:43,240
No!

839
01:29:52,740 --> 01:29:54,580
<i>Target eliminated.</i>

840
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:12,180
You came close...

841
01:30:12,390 --> 01:30:13,740
you freak.

842
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:48,360
<i>Motor center compromised.</i>

843
01:31:31,690 --> 01:31:33,330
Sniper team on site?

844
01:31:34,090 --> 01:31:36,220
Approaching the target now sir.

845
01:31:38,550 --> 01:31:40,100
Come with me.

846
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:44,420
There is no place for us here.

847
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:50,490
No.

848
01:31:56,280 --> 01:31:58,600
I'm not ready to leave.

849
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:01,850
I belong here.

850
01:32:05,550 --> 01:32:08,350
I'll always be there with you...

851
01:32:09,330 --> 01:32:11,160
your ghost.

852
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:18,920
Target is in view.

853
01:32:19,430 --> 01:32:20,800
What are you waiting for?

854
01:32:21,010 --> 01:32:22,010
Do it!

855
01:32:24,300 --> 01:32:25,940
No!

856
01:32:26,780 --> 01:32:28,090
Keep firing.

857
01:32:30,740 --> 01:32:33,220
<i>Saito, have you found Major? Is she safe?</i>

858
01:32:35,810 --> 01:32:36,980
She will be.

859
01:32:59,450 --> 01:33:00,530
Hey..

860
01:33:02,910 --> 01:33:04,060
Hey.

861
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:09,810
Say something nice.

862
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:12,750
What's your name?

863
01:33:13,320 --> 01:33:16,680
Aramaki told me you had a name from before.

864
01:33:20,550 --> 01:33:22,300
Motoko.

865
01:33:27,100 --> 01:33:29,070
Major still in there, right?

866
01:33:31,050 --> 01:33:32,480
I am.

867
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:49,240
<i>Mr. Cutter.</i>

868
01:33:50,580 --> 01:33:52,010
<i>I talked with the Prime Minister.</i>

869
01:33:52,340 --> 01:33:55,600
<i>You are accused of murder
and crimes against the state.</i>

870
01:34:00,460 --> 01:34:02,210
I thought that it might be you.

871
01:34:06,490 --> 01:34:08,500
<i>It is unwise to resist.</i>

872
01:34:28,790 --> 01:34:29,790
Please.

873
01:34:30,250 --> 01:34:31,410
<i>Major?</i>

874
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,310
<i>I am with Cutter.</i>

875
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:37,110
<i>Do you wanna say anything
before I kill him?</i>

876
01:34:37,900 --> 01:34:39,950
Tell him this is justice.

877
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:42,480
It's what I was built for.

878
01:34:43,390 --> 01:34:45,940
So do you give consent?

879
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:48,530
My name is Major.

880
01:34:49,510 --> 01:34:51,400
And I give my consent.

881
01:36:02,450 --> 01:36:04,800
You don't have to come here anymore.

882
01:36:07,560 --> 01:36:09,120
I know.

883
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:46,370
My mind is human.

884
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:49,920
My body is manufactured.

885
01:36:51,940 --> 01:36:53,900
I am the first of my kind, but...

886
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:57,270
I won't be the last.

887
01:37:01,750 --> 01:37:05,060
We cling to memories
as if they define us.

888
01:37:06,250 --> 01:37:09,210
But what we do defines us.

889
01:37:15,610 --> 01:37:18,760
My ghost survived
to remind the next of us...

890
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:22,830
that humanity is our virtue.

891
01:37:24,770 --> 01:37:26,600
I know who I am...

892
01:37:27,650 --> 01:37:29,480
and what I'm here to do.

893
01:37:34,010 --> 01:37:34,820
<i>Major.</i>

894
01:37:35,300 --> 01:37:36,850
<i>Engage targets.</i>

895
01:37:51,680 --> 01:37:53,270
<i>You're authorized.</i>
