1
00:01:21,087 --> 00:01:23,338
In the last 50 years,
we've doubled our population,

2
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,254
tripled the amount of
food and water we use,

3
00:01:26,337 --> 00:01:30,379
and we have quadrupled
the use of fossil fuels.

4
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,338
Every four days, there's a million
more people on the planet.

5
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:38,879
How is the world gonna cope
with this explosion in population?

6
00:01:38,962 --> 00:01:41,379
The UN predicts
that, by the end of the decade,

7
00:01:41,462 --> 00:01:44,296
we will have a population of ten billion.

8
00:01:44,378 --> 00:01:46,879
I am a firm believer
that climate change is real,

9
00:01:47,462 --> 00:01:50,129
that it is impacted by human behavior.

10
00:01:50,212 --> 00:01:53,838
The government has declared
most of South America a disaster zone.

11
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,588
Extreme drought and massive dust storms

12
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,754
have shut down
the Earth's entire agricultural system.

13
00:01:59,837 --> 00:02:02,463
Too many people, not enough food.

14
00:02:02,545 --> 00:02:04,921
In an effort
to combat the food shortage,

15
00:02:05,003 --> 00:02:08,588
the European Federation has placed
the world's future in the hands of science.

16
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,213
The development
of more resilient, high-yield,

17
00:02:11,295 --> 00:02:15,296
genetically modified crops
is being fast-tracked around the globe.

18
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,838
Shelves once empty are now fully-stocked.

19
00:02:20,003 --> 00:02:23,963
But the tinkering with nature
has created long-term consequences.

20
00:02:24,712 --> 00:02:27,713
Across the world,
we are witnessing a staggering spike

21
00:02:27,795 --> 00:02:31,004
in multiple births and genetic defects.

22
00:02:31,087 --> 00:02:34,004
The solution is now
feeding the problem.

23
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:36,296
It is the biggest crisis
in human history.

24
00:02:36,378 --> 00:02:39,379
Political activist
and renowned conservation biologist

25
00:02:39,462 --> 00:02:42,379
Dr. Nicolette Cayman
has prompted the Federation

26
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:45,629
to institute a "one child
per family" policy

27
00:02:45,712 --> 00:02:48,879
called the "Child Allocation Act."

28
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:53,171
We are one human family sharing this Earth.

29
00:02:53,253 --> 00:02:56,379
Today, together, we make history.

30
00:02:56,962 --> 00:03:01,171
The Child Allocation Act
is the first vital step

31
00:03:01,253 --> 00:03:03,463
towards preserving our planet

32
00:03:03,545 --> 00:03:06,838
and making a better
future for our children.

33
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,713
New legislation has been swift.

34
00:03:08,795 --> 00:03:11,088
Check points have been
erected across the nation.

35
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:15,088
All citizens are required to wear
a Bureau-issued identity bracelet.

36
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:18,754
And, from this day forth,
illegally conceived siblings

37
00:03:18,837 --> 00:03:21,754
will be remanded
to Bureau-enforced cryosleep.

38
00:03:21,837 --> 00:03:25,879
Children are more than just children.
They are the future.

39
00:03:25,962 --> 00:03:29,504
With cryosleep, we'll make sure
your child rests peacefully,

40
00:03:29,587 --> 00:03:33,296
humanely, free from hunger, safe from harm,

41
00:03:33,378 --> 00:03:36,671
while we work to build
a better, brighter future.

42
00:03:36,753 --> 00:03:37,963
Cryosleep.

43
00:03:39,253 --> 00:03:41,588
Awake to a better world.

44
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:42,838
I know there's...

45
00:03:44,003 --> 00:03:47,254
maybe a little resistance,
but, with the "one child" policy...

46
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,838
it may give us some time.

47
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:18,171
I'm so sorry, Mr. Settman.
We did everything we could.

48
00:04:19,128 --> 00:04:20,838
If we were better equipped,

49
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,963
there's a chance
we might've been able to saved her.

50
00:04:23,045 --> 00:04:24,129
She knew the risks.

51
00:04:27,253 --> 00:04:29,338
She knew you wouldn't report her.

52
00:04:32,128 --> 00:04:34,296
- And the father?
- Who knows?

53
00:04:34,962 --> 00:04:35,963
My daughter...

54
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:39,838
We haven't spoken in years.

55
00:04:45,003 --> 00:04:47,213
How do you plan on hiding this?

56
00:04:48,753 --> 00:04:49,754
How will you cope?

57
00:04:51,087 --> 00:04:52,088
I'll manage.

58
00:04:53,712 --> 00:04:54,713
I'll have to.

59
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,588
Have you thought about names?

60
00:05:05,628 --> 00:05:07,046
Well...

61
00:05:11,337 --> 00:05:12,338
There are seven.

62
00:05:14,795 --> 00:05:15,796
So...

63
00:05:16,462 --> 00:05:19,671
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,

64
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:25,463
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.

65
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,504
Free from hunger, safe from harm,

66
00:05:55,587 --> 00:05:58,421
while we work to build
a better, brighter future.

67
00:05:59,545 --> 00:06:02,296
Cryosleep. Awake to a better world.

68
00:06:02,837 --> 00:06:06,504
Children are more than just children.
They are the future.

69
00:06:06,587 --> 00:06:11,546
With cryosleep, we'll make sure
your child rests peacefully, humanely.

70
00:06:11,628 --> 00:06:14,421
Please have your
wristbands ready for inspection.

71
00:06:15,003 --> 00:06:17,879
No unauthorized persons
are allowed to enter the sector.

72
00:06:17,962 --> 00:06:20,921
The following items may not be taken
through checkpoints

73
00:06:21,003 --> 00:06:22,504
without prior permission:

74
00:06:22,587 --> 00:06:26,421
any sharp objects,
flammables, or chemicals.

75
00:06:26,503 --> 00:06:27,744
For your safety and security...

76
00:06:49,587 --> 00:06:52,004
My baby!

77
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:05,129
Don't take her, please! Please!
She's my child! She's my child!

78
00:07:18,587 --> 00:07:21,713
This sibling is now listed

79
00:07:21,795 --> 00:07:24,921
and will be processed under authority
of the Child Allocation Act.

80
00:07:25,003 --> 00:07:28,629
No! No! My baby!

81
00:07:33,003 --> 00:07:35,129
- My baby!
- She's my sister!

82
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,588
Can I have that one?

83
00:08:24,753 --> 00:08:27,254
"What happens to a dream deferred?

84
00:08:27,337 --> 00:08:32,421
Does it dry up like a raisin in the sun,
or fester like a sore and then run?

85
00:08:32,503 --> 00:08:37,546
Maybe it just sags like a heavy load.
Or does it explode?"

86
00:08:37,628 --> 00:08:39,879
I like it. Did you write that?

87
00:08:39,962 --> 00:08:41,338
No, ma'am.

88
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:44,713
That's the great Langston Hughes,
jazz king of Harlem.

89
00:08:45,837 --> 00:08:48,046
Haven't I already told you that?

90
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,463
Must have slipped my mind.

91
00:08:52,253 --> 00:08:55,046
Tell me, Miss Settman, what's your secret?

92
00:08:55,128 --> 00:09:00,838
Last night, you're puking in the planter,
but, today, you're looking fresh as a daisy.

93
00:09:43,295 --> 00:09:44,296
Dinner is served.

94
00:09:45,587 --> 00:09:48,296
- That's interesting.
- Spreadsheets for tomorrow.

95
00:09:48,378 --> 00:09:50,504
I'm starving.

96
00:09:50,587 --> 00:09:53,171
- You are always starving.
- I think you might have worms.

97
00:09:53,253 --> 00:09:55,379
Oh, come on, Saturday.

98
00:09:56,795 --> 00:09:59,963
I hope I have worms.
We can cook them next week.

99
00:10:02,545 --> 00:10:04,963
- Ugh, that's gross.
- It's delicious.

100
00:10:05,712 --> 00:10:07,588
It's kind of beautiful.

101
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:10,838
- It's a fucking rat.
- It's actually quite good.

102
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,546
At least, it tastes like something,
unlike that engineered shit you're eating.

103
00:10:14,628 --> 00:10:16,963
Oh, come on, Wednesday. You'd eat anything.

104
00:10:17,628 --> 00:10:22,796
Deep-fried pig dick on a stick.

105
00:10:22,878 --> 00:10:24,796
You'd buy it and you'd eat it.

106
00:10:37,087 --> 00:10:38,088
Are you okay?

107
00:10:39,087 --> 00:10:40,504
- I'm fine.
- You seem...

108
00:10:40,587 --> 00:10:41,713
I know. It's just...

109
00:10:43,003 --> 00:10:45,088
my big presentation is tomorrow.

110
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,338
You mean "our" presentation.

111
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,588
No thanks to you
getting shitfaced last night.

112
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,588
Yeah, Eddie said you
threw up in the planter.

113
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:54,338
I didn't know what to say.
I felt really embarrassed.

114
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,588
I was entertaining one of our clients.

115
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:00,671
I might have overdone it
on the martinis. Shoot me.

116
00:11:00,753 --> 00:11:04,504
You have to tell us everything, Saturday.
How can you be so stupid?

117
00:11:08,003 --> 00:11:12,046
I'm just tired.
Tomorrow's a big day.

118
00:11:14,795 --> 00:11:18,254
If we get this promotion,
it's all thanks to Friday.

119
00:11:20,253 --> 00:11:22,421
She makes us all look like a genius.

120
00:11:22,503 --> 00:11:24,546
It's a team effort.

121
00:11:25,587 --> 00:11:29,129
You guys did the legwork.
I just crunch numbers.

122
00:11:31,128 --> 00:11:33,254
Seven minds are better than one.

123
00:11:36,753 --> 00:11:38,034
You must work collectively.

124
00:11:39,295 --> 00:11:41,963
You're stronger together
than you are alone.

125
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:48,046
In time, we will select a career
that capitalizes on your joint skills.

126
00:11:49,462 --> 00:11:52,963
What are you waiting for?
Go on, go on. Solve the problem.

127
00:12:09,587 --> 00:12:10,629
May I see?

128
00:12:16,587 --> 00:12:17,588
Very good.

129
00:13:05,045 --> 00:13:07,254
Go, go, go, go, go!

130
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,504
Pay attention, girls.

131
00:14:09,087 --> 00:14:11,546
Tomorrow... is a big day.

132
00:14:13,587 --> 00:14:15,921
You know how there are
seven days in the week.

133
00:14:17,253 --> 00:14:19,338
Well, starting tomorrow,

134
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:23,463
you will each get to go outside
on the day of the week that is your name.

135
00:14:25,337 --> 00:14:29,046
That means Sunday will get
to go outside on Sunday,

136
00:14:29,128 --> 00:14:32,213
Monday on Monday,
Tuesday on Tuesday, and so on.

137
00:14:35,628 --> 00:14:41,546
In here, I want you to be who you are,
dress the way you wish.

138
00:14:42,587 --> 00:14:45,213
I want you to be creative
and express yourself.

139
00:14:46,295 --> 00:14:47,921
But, outside of these walls,

140
00:14:48,503 --> 00:14:54,796
you will all take on the singular identity
of Karen Settman, named after your mother.

141
00:14:55,795 --> 00:15:00,129
- Can I play outside?
- Yes, you can, as long as it's your day.

142
00:15:00,212 --> 00:15:04,421
But you can never go outside together
at the same time, ever.

143
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:06,296
Even with your bracelet.

144
00:15:06,378 --> 00:15:09,004
And, wherever you are
and whatever you're doing...

145
00:15:09,878 --> 00:15:12,171
you can never tell a soul
that you're a sibling.

146
00:15:12,253 --> 00:15:14,921
That's very important. You understand?

147
00:15:17,795 --> 00:15:21,629
Okay. Well, we begin tomorrow.

148
00:15:22,878 --> 00:15:24,629
Starting with you, Thursday.

149
00:15:38,128 --> 00:15:39,921
You ready to do this?

150
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:46,546
Okay.

151
00:16:40,753 --> 00:16:43,590
The following items
may not be taken through checkpoints

152
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,296
without prior permission:

153
00:16:45,378 --> 00:16:48,629
any sharp objects,
flammables, or chemicals.

154
00:16:48,712 --> 00:16:50,671
For your safety and security,

155
00:16:50,753 --> 00:16:54,463
have your bags ready for inspection
by an enforcement officer.

156
00:16:55,212 --> 00:16:57,879
Please have your wristbands
ready for inspection.

157
00:16:58,462 --> 00:17:01,296
No unauthorized persons
are allowed to enter the sector.

158
00:17:19,503 --> 00:17:22,963
Don't forget, you're the one
and only Karen Settman.

159
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,546
The end of the day meeting
is the most important part of your day.

160
00:17:45,628 --> 00:17:48,629
It's the time to share
every detail with your siblings.

161
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:51,963
Okay?

162
00:18:05,337 --> 00:18:06,338
Mm...

163
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:26,546
- Oh, God.
- Poor kid. Straight to the cryobank.

164
00:18:26,628 --> 00:18:29,754
With Cayman running for Parliament,
security's getting tighter.

165
00:18:29,837 --> 00:18:31,588
I fucking hate that bitch.

166
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:35,629
I don't know.
Maybe cryosleep isn't such a bad idea.

167
00:18:36,587 --> 00:18:38,671
We turn ourselves in, get frozen,

168
00:18:39,128 --> 00:18:42,379
play Sleeping Beauty
until the population drops.

169
00:18:42,462 --> 00:18:45,713
I heard you still dream,
like, horrible nightmares

170
00:18:45,795 --> 00:18:46,963
for hundreds of years.

171
00:18:47,045 --> 00:18:50,838
By the time you wake up,
everyone you know and love will be gone.

172
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,921
Well, we go to sleep together,
we wake up together.

173
00:18:54,795 --> 00:18:57,254
The Child Allocation Act
will be a thing of the past,

174
00:18:57,337 --> 00:18:58,715
and we can finally live our own lives.

175
00:18:58,795 --> 00:19:00,716
Are we really gonna have
this conversation again?

176
00:19:00,837 --> 00:19:03,171
Why can't you just accept
that this is your family?

177
00:19:03,253 --> 00:19:06,088
This isn't a family.
It's a repressive regime.

178
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,796
I didn't pick this life
any more than you did.

179
00:19:08,878 --> 00:19:10,671
Yet you live it so perfectly.

180
00:19:10,753 --> 00:19:13,296
Karen Settman from cradle to grave.

181
00:19:13,378 --> 00:19:15,546
- It's disgusting.
- What do you care?

182
00:19:16,545 --> 00:19:19,129
Your only ambition was to be
a total loser, which you are.

183
00:19:19,212 --> 00:19:20,796
Fuck you, Monday.

184
00:19:21,587 --> 00:19:25,629
Just because I have my own personality and
dreams, and I want to have a relationship

185
00:19:25,712 --> 00:19:29,171
that is more than just a random fuck
with someone that I will never see again?

186
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:33,796
I'm sick to death
of Miss Karen fucking Settman.

187
00:19:33,878 --> 00:19:36,879
Karen Settman is the foundation
we built our lives on.

188
00:19:36,962 --> 00:19:41,671
No, she's a mask,
a mask we put on one day a week.

189
00:19:42,253 --> 00:19:45,298
One day a week we can go out into the real
world, and we can't even be ourselves.

190
00:19:45,378 --> 00:19:48,254
- We have to be a fake person.
- Oh, shut up, both of you!

191
00:19:49,587 --> 00:19:54,296
- You're driving us all crazy.
- Yeah, this is our life. It is what it is.

192
00:19:55,378 --> 00:19:58,004
Being trapped in this prison
six days a week isn't a life.

193
00:19:58,753 --> 00:20:01,796
It's a slow, agonizing, soul-sucking death.

194
00:20:18,378 --> 00:20:19,713
Move over!

195
00:20:19,878 --> 00:20:23,213
Saturday, let's go.
Or you'll be late for your recital.

196
00:20:41,003 --> 00:20:43,754
So... you didn't see her leave...

197
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:49,546
and you don't have any idea
where she might be.

198
00:20:52,503 --> 00:20:53,504
Well...

199
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:59,463
When did you see her last?

200
00:21:42,003 --> 00:21:45,046
I was just skating and I fell! I did!

201
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:54,379
Oh...

202
00:21:58,837 --> 00:22:00,921
Oh, Thursday...

203
00:22:04,837 --> 00:22:06,588
What if the Bureau caught you?

204
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:10,254
One mistake is all it takes
to put all your lives at risk.

205
00:22:10,337 --> 00:22:13,254
I hate Karen Settman!
I wish I had never been born!

206
00:22:13,337 --> 00:22:14,338
Enough!

207
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:18,671
You want to get taken away?

208
00:22:18,753 --> 00:22:21,421
Get frozen for all eternity
in that god-awful machine

209
00:22:21,503 --> 00:22:23,713
and never see me or your sisters again?

210
00:22:28,378 --> 00:22:29,379
Go.

211
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,963
Monday.

212
00:22:35,128 --> 00:22:38,963
I warned you.
Everything you do affects each other.

213
00:22:46,253 --> 00:22:49,338
- What's that for?
- Keep still.

214
00:23:04,253 --> 00:23:05,879
What happens to one of you...

215
00:23:07,212 --> 00:23:08,879
happens to you all.

216
00:23:14,253 --> 00:23:15,379
Monday...

217
00:23:20,212 --> 00:23:21,629
I need you to be brave.

218
00:23:22,962 --> 00:23:24,671
Set an example for your sisters.

219
00:23:29,753 --> 00:23:31,088
Will it hurt?

220
00:23:35,128 --> 00:23:36,129
Yes.

221
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:40,171
Don't move.

222
00:24:12,612 --> 00:24:14,779
I bet that rat tasted better going down.

223
00:24:16,528 --> 00:24:18,154
Shut up.

224
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:22,821
You're burning up. You running a fever?

225
00:24:23,778 --> 00:24:24,779
No.

226
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:29,113
- You sure?
- I'm fine.

227
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:36,488
- Maybe you should switch days.
- I can do Monday.

228
00:24:38,487 --> 00:24:42,279
Success does not come
without sacrifice and struggle.

229
00:24:43,778 --> 00:24:45,654
Shut the fuck up.

230
00:25:28,812 --> 00:25:33,646
"Beneath the tall tree, while night
comes on gently, dark like me."

231
00:25:33,728 --> 00:25:35,104
Langston Hughes again, Eddie.

232
00:25:35,187 --> 00:25:38,354
- You sound like a broken record.
- And a good day to you, too.

233
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,940
The following items
may not be taken through checkpoints

234
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,479
without prior permission:

235
00:25:49,562 --> 00:25:52,979
any sharp objects,
flammables, or chemicals.

236
00:25:53,062 --> 00:25:54,979
For your safety and security...

237
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:09,354
The following items may not
be taken through checkpoints

238
00:26:09,437 --> 00:26:10,979
without prior permission:

239
00:26:11,062 --> 00:26:14,521
any sharp objects,
flammables, or chemicals.

240
00:26:14,603 --> 00:26:17,521
For your safety and security,
have your bags ready for inspection...

241
00:26:17,603 --> 00:26:19,815
- Someone's in a rush, huh?
- By an enforcement officer.

242
00:26:19,895 --> 00:26:20,896
Big day at work.

243
00:26:22,478 --> 00:26:23,813
These lines are getting worse.

244
00:26:26,103 --> 00:26:28,898
Last week, a woman gave birth right here
because she couldn't get through.

245
00:26:28,978 --> 00:26:31,813
- No kidding.
- Of course, it had to happen on my day.

246
00:26:32,978 --> 00:26:35,521
Mondays are the worst.
I hate checkpoint duty.

247
00:26:36,145 --> 00:26:37,604
Except I get to see you.

248
00:26:41,895 --> 00:26:43,938
I'm afraid I have to ask you
a couple of questions.

249
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,101
The Bureau's a stickler for protocol.
You understand.

250
00:26:47,187 --> 00:26:49,688
- What's your name?
- Karen Settman.

251
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:52,688
- Karen, do you have any siblings?
- No.

252
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:55,188
You carrying any contraband?

253
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:57,021
No.

254
00:26:57,603 --> 00:26:58,604
Are you sure?

255
00:26:59,978 --> 00:27:02,479
Do I have to body search you?

256
00:27:07,437 --> 00:27:08,479
You may proceed.

257
00:27:45,062 --> 00:27:47,313
- Karen.
- Jerry.

258
00:27:54,228 --> 00:27:55,229
So...

259
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:59,813
Today's the big day, huh?
We'll see who gets the promotion.

260
00:28:01,603 --> 00:28:03,979
All these years, I've been trying
to figure out your angle.

261
00:28:05,687 --> 00:28:09,813
I always thought, with a body like that,
you'd fuck your way to the top.

262
00:28:12,103 --> 00:28:14,229
But then it turns out,
you're a frigid bitch.

263
00:28:17,478 --> 00:28:20,146
Just because I find you repulsive?

264
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,896
You're not interested in anyone.

265
00:28:29,103 --> 00:28:33,354
Working here, night after night,
like a fucking robot.

266
00:28:36,312 --> 00:28:38,271
You think you have us all fooled,
don't you?

267
00:28:38,353 --> 00:28:41,646
I have no idea what you're talking about.

268
00:28:42,603 --> 00:28:43,646
Yes, you do.

269
00:28:47,937 --> 00:28:48,938
Karen.

270
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:52,188
I'm onto you.

271
00:29:26,145 --> 00:29:27,354
Where the hell is she?

272
00:29:30,478 --> 00:29:33,896
- Did you try her again?
- Yeah. Straight to voicemail.

273
00:29:34,478 --> 00:29:36,604
- Maybe she got held up.
- She would have called.

274
00:29:38,478 --> 00:29:39,479
Ping her bracelet.

275
00:29:48,812 --> 00:29:51,271
- That's weird.
- What?

276
00:29:51,353 --> 00:29:52,688
Her GPS locator is off.

277
00:29:54,437 --> 00:29:56,229
She's not showing up on the grid.

278
00:29:57,687 --> 00:30:02,313
- She can't just vanish.
- Oh, yes, you can... if you want to.

279
00:30:02,395 --> 00:30:04,104
Maybe she was in an accident.

280
00:30:04,187 --> 00:30:07,313
Run a search.
Um, hospitals, police records.

281
00:30:08,937 --> 00:30:11,354
What if Monday's hurt? Or dead?

282
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:15,688
And the authorities find her
before we do?

283
00:30:16,978 --> 00:30:20,729
Then... Karen Settman no longer exists.

284
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:23,563
And our lives are over.

285
00:30:23,645 --> 00:30:26,063
Jeez, she's only a few minutes late.

286
00:30:27,853 --> 00:30:30,563
Monday's never been late
for an end of day meeting.

287
00:30:36,562 --> 00:30:37,563
Ever.

288
00:31:15,145 --> 00:31:19,604
"Eyes bloodshot from excessive drug use
and emotional distress.

289
00:31:21,353 --> 00:31:23,729
Dark circles under the eyes..."

290
00:31:52,145 --> 00:31:53,271
- Ow!
- Stay still.

291
00:31:58,187 --> 00:32:00,396
Really? Pot brownie?

292
00:32:01,103 --> 00:32:04,646
It's medicinal.
You know it's good for my nerves.

293
00:32:08,145 --> 00:32:10,104
I have a bad feeling about this.

294
00:32:10,687 --> 00:32:13,288
Remember what happened last time
two of us were out there at once.

295
00:32:15,353 --> 00:32:16,354
That was bad.

296
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:22,604
We gotta figure out where Monday is.
You gotta act as if everything is normal.

297
00:32:23,187 --> 00:32:28,188
Easy for you to say. It's not your day.
What if we've been listed?

298
00:32:29,478 --> 00:32:31,938
Listen to me.
If Karen Settman's been listed,

299
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:34,901
the Bureau would've kicked in the door,
and we'd all be processed by now.

300
00:32:35,895 --> 00:32:36,896
Well...

301
00:32:38,312 --> 00:32:40,896
technically speaking,
one of us would get to live.

302
00:32:53,437 --> 00:32:56,063
- Good morning, Miss Settman.
- Good morning, Eddie.

303
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,938
I didn't see you come home yesterday.

304
00:33:01,103 --> 00:33:05,521
After hours. Let myself in.

305
00:33:29,645 --> 00:33:33,146
May not be taken through
checkpoints without prior permission:

306
00:33:33,228 --> 00:33:36,438
any sharp objects,
flammables, or chemicals.

307
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,313
For your safety and security,

308
00:33:38,395 --> 00:33:41,896
have your bag ready for inspection
by an enforcement officer.

309
00:33:44,145 --> 00:33:45,146
She's through.

310
00:34:10,145 --> 00:34:11,854
So, we got our promotion.

311
00:34:11,937 --> 00:34:13,479
Stay focused, Tuesday.

312
00:34:13,562 --> 00:34:17,063
Check the calendar, desktop,
anything that might give us a clue.

313
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:22,979
I've got the brief for
your conference call.

314
00:34:23,062 --> 00:34:25,396
Vicky, when was the last time
you synched my tablet?

315
00:34:25,478 --> 00:34:28,646
9:03 this morning. Why?

316
00:34:29,353 --> 00:34:31,854
Um, I forgot to log out last night.

317
00:34:32,562 --> 00:34:34,396
You left early to celebrate.

318
00:34:34,853 --> 00:34:36,729
Yes, of course.

319
00:34:37,687 --> 00:34:38,688
Um...

320
00:34:39,603 --> 00:34:42,188
Where did I go again?

321
00:34:43,228 --> 00:34:46,354
Your favorite bar. Harry's.

322
00:34:46,437 --> 00:34:50,188
Yes, of course. Harry's. Thanks.

323
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:51,271
You're welcome.

324
00:35:33,853 --> 00:35:35,646
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

325
00:35:39,853 --> 00:35:40,854
Mm...

326
00:35:42,978 --> 00:35:45,521
Last night, um... do you remember what...

327
00:35:45,603 --> 00:35:46,854
what time I left?

328
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:50,396
You only stayed for one drink.
You barely touched it.

329
00:35:50,478 --> 00:35:52,479
I think that colleague
of yours put you off.

330
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:54,271
Yeah.

331
00:35:55,145 --> 00:35:57,438
God, yeah. Which one of them?

332
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:01,146
You know, that douchebag in the suspenders.

333
00:36:02,145 --> 00:36:05,021
- Jerry, I think?
- Yeah.

334
00:36:07,812 --> 00:36:10,438
Monday and Jerry argued
just before she left the bar.

335
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:13,646
He's onto us.

336
00:36:14,603 --> 00:36:17,146
- I knew it.
- Fucking dick sold us out.

337
00:36:17,228 --> 00:36:20,688
Then why aren't we listed?
You've got to corner him, Tuesday.

338
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:24,438
- Find out what he knows.
- Are you nuts?

339
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,979
He could be the last person who saw Monday.

340
00:36:28,145 --> 00:36:30,771
- He's our only lead.
- Yeah, okay.

341
00:36:41,062 --> 00:36:42,063
Miss Settman.

342
00:36:44,937 --> 00:36:45,938
Yes?

343
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:48,313
Step into the van, please.

344
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,521
Is there a problem?

345
00:36:51,853 --> 00:36:53,813
I don't understand. Who are you?

346
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:04,396
Step into the fucking van.

347
00:37:19,395 --> 00:37:20,563
Wha...?

348
00:37:20,645 --> 00:37:23,604
That's weird. I lost her.

349
00:37:49,478 --> 00:37:50,854
There's obviously been a mistake.

350
00:37:51,562 --> 00:37:53,479
Can you please tell me what I'm doing here?

351
00:38:21,395 --> 00:38:22,396
Miss Settman.

352
00:38:26,228 --> 00:38:28,479
What a pleasure to meet you.

353
00:38:43,478 --> 00:38:44,979
Nicolette Cayman.

354
00:38:48,437 --> 00:38:50,521
I know who you are. Uh...

355
00:38:54,853 --> 00:38:57,146
Can you please tell me why I'm here?

356
00:39:00,395 --> 00:39:01,646
You poor child.

357
00:39:04,312 --> 00:39:07,271
I am amazed you made it this far.

358
00:39:09,562 --> 00:39:12,896
This is... This is all a big mistake.

359
00:39:13,478 --> 00:39:15,063
Seven children.

360
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,854
What was your grandfather thinking?

361
00:39:20,645 --> 00:39:23,604
Do you have any idea how
much food and water

362
00:39:23,687 --> 00:39:26,813
was taken out of others' mouths
so you could be here today?

363
00:39:26,895 --> 00:39:31,813
If everyone were as cruel and selfish
as Terrence Settman,

364
00:39:31,895 --> 00:39:33,438
the world would end tomorrow.

365
00:39:38,728 --> 00:39:40,771
I am an only child.

366
00:39:43,478 --> 00:39:45,396
For your sake, I wish that were true.

367
00:39:47,312 --> 00:39:48,433
There are five of them left.

368
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:52,979
All the rotten eggs in one basket.

369
00:39:55,312 --> 00:39:57,813
- Is there another way?
- Not if you want to keep it quiet.

370
00:40:03,187 --> 00:40:05,146
What are you doing? Um...

371
00:40:07,687 --> 00:40:10,854
I-I work in a bank!
I can get you money! Please! Please!

372
00:40:10,937 --> 00:40:12,896
We can make some kind of deal! Please!

373
00:40:14,353 --> 00:40:15,354
Funny.

374
00:40:17,895 --> 00:40:19,604
That's what the last one said.

375
00:40:24,978 --> 00:40:29,979
No, wait! No! No, please, no!
No, no, no, no!

376
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:07,188
I can't believe this is happening.

377
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:10,354
We can't just sit here.

378
00:41:11,395 --> 00:41:14,438
We gotta help her. We gotta...
We gotta go out there.

379
00:41:17,812 --> 00:41:22,604
We gotta do something!

380
00:41:24,645 --> 00:41:27,229
Thursday...

381
00:41:41,812 --> 00:41:42,813
Oh, my God.

382
00:41:45,187 --> 00:41:46,479
What the...?

383
00:41:56,228 --> 00:41:58,021
Residents or visitors?

384
00:42:00,812 --> 00:42:01,803
Visitors.

385
00:42:27,343 --> 00:42:29,428
Shh...

386
00:43:28,927 --> 00:43:30,094
Step out.

387
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,803
All of you.

388
00:43:34,218 --> 00:43:35,303
Now!

389
00:43:42,885 --> 00:43:43,886
That's it.

390
00:43:44,677 --> 00:43:46,094
Nice and slow.

391
00:43:46,843 --> 00:43:48,511
Nice and slow.

392
00:43:51,135 --> 00:43:52,553
This way.

393
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:12,011
Look at them.

394
00:44:12,968 --> 00:44:14,261
Hiding like rats.

395
00:44:23,843 --> 00:44:24,844
So...

396
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:28,303
Where's the last one?

397
00:44:30,843 --> 00:44:31,844
Fuck you.

398
00:45:26,093 --> 00:45:27,844
You fucking cunt!

399
00:45:56,968 --> 00:45:58,344
Fucking cu...

400
00:47:39,468 --> 00:47:40,469
Is it bad?

401
00:47:42,552 --> 00:47:44,428
It's okay. Look at me.

402
00:47:51,843 --> 00:47:55,678
I don't want to die. I don't want to die.

403
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:59,761
You're gonna be okay. I'm here. It's okay.

404
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:08,969
I'm sorry.

405
00:48:10,718 --> 00:48:12,136
I'm so sorry.

406
00:48:13,343 --> 00:48:15,553
No. You're Sunday.

407
00:48:18,343 --> 00:48:20,053
You're supposed to be the believer.

408
00:48:30,802 --> 00:48:32,678
I don't know what I believe.

409
00:48:36,093 --> 00:48:37,511
I don't...

410
00:48:42,927 --> 00:48:44,303
I don't know who I am.

411
00:49:11,552 --> 00:49:13,053
No!

412
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:19,594
No! No!

413
00:49:22,677 --> 00:49:24,178
No!

414
00:49:32,843 --> 00:49:34,553
Goddamn it!

415
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:05,553
They won't suffer.

416
00:50:06,968 --> 00:50:08,886
- Excuse me?
- I'm assured of that.

417
00:50:11,343 --> 00:50:12,344
Um...

418
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,053
We may have a containment problem.

419
00:50:15,635 --> 00:50:18,303
We still haven't heard back
from the Settman team.

420
00:50:23,635 --> 00:50:28,844
Last night, I dreamed this whole building
erupted and spewed out all the siblings.

421
00:50:31,052 --> 00:50:32,469
There were so many of them.

422
00:50:33,677 --> 00:50:35,719
A sea of little bodies...

423
00:50:37,635 --> 00:50:39,261
scorched by flames.

424
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:42,219
I know what you feel for these children.

425
00:50:43,552 --> 00:50:46,553
But this is on their parents, not you.

426
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:49,094
Sometimes, I think, "To hell with it."

427
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,053
To hell with everybody.

428
00:50:53,802 --> 00:50:55,594
Humans will never learn.

429
00:50:56,177 --> 00:50:58,678
You're our last chance, Dr. Cayman.

430
00:51:00,843 --> 00:51:02,303
Our only hope.

431
00:51:06,302 --> 00:51:09,053
I need you, Joe. Be careful.

432
00:51:10,802 --> 00:51:13,844
Do not underestimate the Settmans.

433
00:51:14,677 --> 00:51:17,430
If we officially list them,
they'll be flagged at the first checkpoint

434
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:18,928
and processed within hours.

435
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:23,969
Seven siblings surviving to adulthood?
It would destroy my credibility. No.

436
00:51:24,843 --> 00:51:26,594
We have to keep this localized.

437
00:51:27,177 --> 00:51:29,553
They are trapped inside that apartment
and they know it.

438
00:51:30,677 --> 00:51:33,886
Besides... we have another issue.

439
00:51:35,593 --> 00:51:36,886
A complication.

440
00:51:37,718 --> 00:51:39,344
Make that a priority.

441
00:51:40,093 --> 00:51:43,303
Then deal with the Settmans.

442
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:20,053
It's Tuesday's.

443
00:52:20,135 --> 00:52:22,594
No...

444
00:52:47,927 --> 00:52:51,136
What the fuck are we doing? Huh?

445
00:52:51,218 --> 00:52:53,094
We gotta get out of here now.

446
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:56,719
They know about us.
They're gonna send more people.

447
00:52:56,802 --> 00:52:59,886
Let them come. I'll fucking kill them all.

448
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:01,386
Calm down.

449
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:03,719
Just think for a second.

450
00:53:05,218 --> 00:53:07,636
Four of us out there at once?
With all the Bureau agents

451
00:53:07,718 --> 00:53:09,094
and checkpoints and sensors?

452
00:53:09,177 --> 00:53:11,553
We won't last for two minutes.

453
00:53:11,635 --> 00:53:16,303
We always work best as a team...
in an environment we can control.

454
00:53:16,385 --> 00:53:18,053
Those guys, they weren't Bureau.

455
00:53:18,968 --> 00:53:22,386
Or we'd be listed by now, and this place
would be crawling with agents.

456
00:53:22,468 --> 00:53:24,886
Somebody wants us to disappear.

457
00:53:34,343 --> 00:53:36,261
The question is why.

458
00:53:49,593 --> 00:53:51,386
Fuck it.

459
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:56,928
Every Wednesday,
I wear a stupid dress and high heels.

460
00:53:57,010 --> 00:53:58,428
Not today.

461
00:54:00,843 --> 00:54:03,344
- What's that?
- Something I wish I thought of yesterday.

462
00:54:03,427 --> 00:54:06,803
I customized it,
so we'll see and hear everything you do.

463
00:54:08,927 --> 00:54:10,511
It's a user-locked grip.

464
00:54:11,968 --> 00:54:13,594
Can you unlock it?

465
00:54:13,677 --> 00:54:14,844
If I had more time.

466
00:54:16,010 --> 00:54:17,428
For now, it's not gonna fire.

467
00:54:17,510 --> 00:54:22,219
- Doesn't make it any less intimidating.
- This isn't a game, Wednesday.

468
00:54:22,302 --> 00:54:26,511
Go to Jerry's. Find out what he knows.
Don't lose your head out there.

469
00:54:29,677 --> 00:54:30,678
I won't.

470
00:54:31,552 --> 00:54:36,178
Cryosleep. Awake to a better world.

471
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:03,011
Hello, Karen.
You're cutting it close. Aren't you?

472
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:09,761
Please.

473
00:55:12,177 --> 00:55:13,469
Rough night?

474
00:55:19,718 --> 00:55:21,594
Well, I did say you had until this morning,

475
00:55:21,677 --> 00:55:24,886
and it's still morning, I guess,
technically, so...

476
00:55:33,177 --> 00:55:34,219
What's it gonna be?

477
00:55:38,843 --> 00:55:40,678
What's what gonna be?

478
00:55:41,718 --> 00:55:43,928
Do we have a deal or not?

479
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:46,511
Deal...

480
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,178
What deal?

481
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:51,469
Playing dumb doesn't suit ya, Settman.

482
00:55:53,052 --> 00:55:54,053
This is very simple.

483
00:55:55,302 --> 00:55:57,053
You pass on the promotion.

484
00:55:57,635 --> 00:55:58,678
It goes to me.

485
00:55:59,343 --> 00:56:02,303
And I keep my mouth shut
about your little secret.

486
00:56:08,343 --> 00:56:09,678
You motherfucker!

487
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:20,344
How long have you known?

488
00:56:21,052 --> 00:56:23,011
Huh?

489
00:56:24,843 --> 00:56:28,803
You should be glad it was me
who found that contract,

490
00:56:29,510 --> 00:56:31,344
or you'd be in jail by now.

491
00:56:33,177 --> 00:56:34,678
What contract?

492
00:56:36,135 --> 00:56:38,428
- Are you serious?
- What fucking contract?

493
00:56:38,510 --> 00:56:41,469
407-C funds transfer.

494
00:56:43,093 --> 00:56:44,761
Your contract with Cayman.

495
00:56:46,510 --> 00:56:47,553
Cayman.

496
00:56:51,427 --> 00:56:52,928
Nicolette Cayman.

497
00:56:54,177 --> 00:56:57,386
Yeah. Your new VIP client.

498
00:56:58,802 --> 00:57:00,178
Do you guys know about this?

499
00:57:19,177 --> 00:57:20,011
Wow.

500
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:24,344
This, um... This contract,
wh... where is it?

501
00:57:24,427 --> 00:57:26,094
On my tablet.

502
00:57:26,677 --> 00:57:27,678
Show it to me.

503
00:57:30,718 --> 00:57:31,719
Yeah.

504
00:57:40,177 --> 00:57:41,178
Get out of there!

505
00:58:02,968 --> 00:58:04,678
Lost sight of the target.

506
00:58:07,593 --> 00:58:11,053
Going in. Hold position.

507
00:58:33,302 --> 00:58:35,053
Guys? You there?

508
00:58:36,718 --> 00:58:38,553
Which way? Where do I go?

509
00:58:43,885 --> 00:58:45,386
Best option is front door.

510
00:58:49,843 --> 00:58:52,261
- Spread out.
- That's not an option.

511
01:00:21,552 --> 01:00:22,678
Oh, shit.

512
01:00:27,427 --> 01:00:28,428
Erickson?

513
01:00:31,010 --> 01:00:32,011
Erickson, copy.

514
01:00:32,593 --> 01:00:33,594
Erickson.

515
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:01,966
Sir?

516
01:02:02,548 --> 01:02:03,549
Sir, do you copy?

517
01:02:04,382 --> 01:02:06,424
What's going on up there?
Do you need backup?

518
01:02:18,215 --> 01:02:19,674
Guess so.

519
01:02:20,257 --> 01:02:23,091
Move it! Take the sibling down.

520
01:02:31,173 --> 01:02:33,633
Girls? I need a way out, now.

521
01:02:37,257 --> 01:02:40,424
There, a dumpster, below
the bedroom window.

522
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:43,758
- Come on.
- It's a three-story drop,

523
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:45,302
but the trash will soften the impact.

524
01:02:48,007 --> 01:02:49,216
You better be right, sis.

525
01:03:05,965 --> 01:03:06,966
Fuck!

526
01:03:08,257 --> 01:03:09,341
It's empty.

527
01:03:09,423 --> 01:03:14,091
The trash collection
is every Wednesday morning. Sorry.

528
01:03:15,757 --> 01:03:16,924
Are you okay?

529
01:03:17,007 --> 01:03:19,633
- Can you run?
- I think so.

530
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:23,299
Then run.

531
01:03:38,382 --> 01:03:39,799
Go, go, go!

532
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:42,258
Guys, where am I going?

533
01:03:43,590 --> 01:03:46,258
Next left. There's a door
at the end of the alley.

534
01:04:52,548 --> 01:04:53,549
Come on.

535
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:57,924
What are you waiting for? Go get her!

536
01:05:05,590 --> 01:05:06,841
Everybody move!

537
01:05:18,423 --> 01:05:19,424
Move!

538
01:05:21,215 --> 01:05:22,466
Get out of the fucking way!

539
01:05:22,548 --> 01:05:24,258
- Get out of the way!
- Move!

540
01:05:47,423 --> 01:05:48,549
What do I do?

541
01:05:48,632 --> 01:05:52,216
We need to get you on the roof.
I can get you home from there.

542
01:05:52,298 --> 01:05:53,299
Hold tight.

543
01:06:03,798 --> 01:06:05,758
- Oh, shit.
- It's the Bureau.

544
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:08,424
- I thought you said we're not listed.
- We're not.

545
01:06:08,507 --> 01:06:12,299
- Then what the fuck is he doing here?
- Friday? Friday!

546
01:06:18,173 --> 01:06:20,258
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait!

547
01:06:22,048 --> 01:06:24,049
- What are you gonna do?
- Find out what he wants.

548
01:06:25,882 --> 01:06:26,883
And get rid of him.

549
01:06:31,382 --> 01:06:32,383
I got this.

550
01:06:36,173 --> 01:06:38,008
Hey, open up!

551
01:06:48,423 --> 01:06:50,216
- Hey.
- Hey.

552
01:06:52,798 --> 01:06:53,799
New look?

553
01:06:57,132 --> 01:06:58,258
Y-Yeah.

554
01:06:59,173 --> 01:07:02,716
Yeah, I wanted to, um... try something new.

555
01:07:02,798 --> 01:07:04,383
Nice.

556
01:07:06,965 --> 01:07:10,466
Um, I called your... your office.
They said you were out sick.

557
01:07:11,382 --> 01:07:12,927
I know. I know I'm not supposed to call,

558
01:07:13,007 --> 01:07:16,924
- but when I saw you at the Bureau, I was...
- The... The Bureau?

559
01:07:19,465 --> 01:07:20,466
Yeah.

560
01:07:21,465 --> 01:07:23,299
Yeah, yeah, I had to go and, um...

561
01:07:25,382 --> 01:07:26,508
drop off some stuff.

562
01:07:28,548 --> 01:07:29,924
Boring bank stuff.

563
01:07:34,757 --> 01:07:36,424
Aren't you going to invite me in?

564
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:39,633
I was only joking about the forced entry.

565
01:07:45,090 --> 01:07:46,091
Friday?

566
01:07:47,465 --> 01:07:49,508
Hold on.
We've got a situation.

567
01:07:49,590 --> 01:07:50,966
You've got a situation?

568
01:07:58,590 --> 01:07:59,591
It's a nice place.

569
01:08:00,298 --> 01:08:02,883
Friday? You there?

570
01:08:42,423 --> 01:08:44,258
Who the fuck is this guy?

571
01:08:55,048 --> 01:08:56,091
Please don't do that.

572
01:08:57,382 --> 01:08:58,383
What?

573
01:08:59,923 --> 01:09:02,008
Are you... Are you serious?

574
01:09:03,298 --> 01:09:05,549
Sorry, I thought you
liked that stuff. I'm...

575
01:09:07,215 --> 01:09:08,216
Just, um...

576
01:09:09,382 --> 01:09:12,424
Just... give me a sec.

577
01:09:13,007 --> 01:09:15,258
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

578
01:09:34,007 --> 01:09:37,049
- What the hell is going on?
- You tell me. Who is that guy?

579
01:09:37,132 --> 01:09:38,966
Don't bullshit me.
Have you been seeing him?

580
01:09:39,048 --> 01:09:40,383
What? No.

581
01:09:40,465 --> 01:09:43,008
He's a Bureau agent.
Do you think I'm fucking stupid?

582
01:09:43,090 --> 01:09:46,466
- You two seemed very familiar.
- It's called acting.

583
01:09:46,548 --> 01:09:49,466
How do I know you're not acting now
and you've been seeing him all along?

584
01:09:50,882 --> 01:09:54,258
I've never seen him in my life,
I swear to God.

585
01:09:59,673 --> 01:10:02,299
You need to... to get him
to take you to his place

586
01:10:02,382 --> 01:10:04,549
and find out which one of us
he's been seeing.

587
01:10:04,632 --> 01:10:07,549
- What?
- Yeah, find out what he knows.

588
01:10:07,632 --> 01:10:10,383
Have you lost it completely?
You want me to go with him?

589
01:10:11,548 --> 01:10:14,174
- Yeah.
- I think he wants to fuck me.

590
01:10:14,257 --> 01:10:15,924
Well, no shit.

591
01:10:21,132 --> 01:10:23,258
- Show me your bracelet.
- Why?

592
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:26,133
It's a coupling device
from the dead guy's bracelet.

593
01:10:26,923 --> 01:10:29,049
All you need to do is
get yours close to his.

594
01:10:30,590 --> 01:10:32,133
Wait. What?

595
01:10:32,715 --> 01:10:36,383
Just activate your bracelet
and connect it to that guy's,

596
01:10:36,465 --> 01:10:38,674
and we get a gateway
into the Bureau's servers.

597
01:10:46,798 --> 01:10:48,258
What if he catches me?

598
01:10:48,340 --> 01:10:51,633
Well, I'm sure you know
a few tricks to distract him.

599
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:54,799
Well, I don't know any tricks.

600
01:10:56,673 --> 01:10:58,174
What do you mean?

601
01:11:04,798 --> 01:11:06,091
All your big talk...

602
01:11:08,173 --> 01:11:09,883
You've never been with anyone?

603
01:11:14,298 --> 01:11:15,341
I'll be right there!

604
01:11:39,423 --> 01:11:41,091
Oh, God! Wednesday!

605
01:11:42,132 --> 01:11:43,133
Oh, shit!

606
01:11:49,798 --> 01:11:52,049
- We're back.
- About time.

607
01:11:52,132 --> 01:11:54,174
There's, uh, roof access.

608
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:56,758
The last door, southwest corner.

609
01:12:22,548 --> 01:12:23,549
Guys...

610
01:12:24,673 --> 01:12:26,549
There is no way I can clear this.

611
01:12:27,132 --> 01:12:28,966
There's only two ways
out of this, Wednesday.

612
01:12:29,048 --> 01:12:32,591
You make that jump or you catch a bullet.
At least, this way, you stand a chance.

613
01:12:47,965 --> 01:12:49,799
You've been training for this
your whole life.

614
01:12:50,507 --> 01:12:51,508
You can do it.

615
01:12:52,548 --> 01:12:53,549
Move! Move!

616
01:12:56,165 --> 01:12:57,966
You can make that jump.

617
01:14:09,798 --> 01:14:11,320
Get her to the processing center.

618
01:14:12,090 --> 01:14:13,924
They'll know what to do.

619
01:14:15,007 --> 01:14:16,008
I'll call it in.

620
01:14:24,007 --> 01:14:25,758
What do you want to drink?

621
01:14:27,423 --> 01:14:29,466
- A shot of vodka.
- Oh.

622
01:15:51,007 --> 01:15:52,216
The file from Wednesday.

623
01:15:52,298 --> 01:15:56,383
It's a 407-C funds transfer,
just like Jerry said.

624
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:02,591
Why would Karen Settman

625
01:16:02,673 --> 01:16:07,883
illegally transfer millions of euros
into Nicolette Cayman's campaign fund?

626
01:16:11,090 --> 01:16:15,049
This contract was executed the same day
as we got our promotion.

627
01:16:18,965 --> 01:16:20,383
A transfer that big...

628
01:16:21,298 --> 01:16:22,299
Hm...

629
01:16:25,507 --> 01:16:29,049
Karen Settman really needed that promotion.

630
01:16:33,215 --> 01:16:34,258
That's weird.

631
01:16:36,090 --> 01:16:37,841
There's no signature.

632
01:18:00,632 --> 01:18:01,799
We're in.

633
01:18:03,423 --> 01:18:05,633
- She did it.
- Yeah.

634
01:18:29,007 --> 01:18:30,008
Fuck me.

635
01:19:07,798 --> 01:19:09,258
Wh-Where are the cells?

636
01:19:10,173 --> 01:19:12,174
You know, where they keep people.

637
01:19:13,090 --> 01:19:14,091
Oh, uh...

638
01:19:14,173 --> 01:19:16,883
- The processing center.
- Can you get in there?

639
01:19:17,548 --> 01:19:20,216
I think so. Hold on.

640
01:19:43,757 --> 01:19:44,758
Stop.

641
01:19:50,923 --> 01:19:53,424
- Is this feed real time?
- Yeah.

642
01:20:05,507 --> 01:20:07,591
I-I think it's Monday.

643
01:20:35,090 --> 01:20:36,341
Oh, shit.

644
01:20:38,090 --> 01:20:39,091
I'm late.

645
01:20:39,798 --> 01:20:41,924
Don't go.

646
01:20:42,007 --> 01:20:44,133
I gotta go.

647
01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:52,466
There's this big event
at the Bureau tonight.

648
01:20:53,340 --> 01:20:55,022
Cayman's starting her push for Parliament.

649
01:21:02,257 --> 01:21:03,633
Why are you working for them?

650
01:21:05,007 --> 01:21:07,674
The Bureau? Why not?

651
01:21:09,590 --> 01:21:11,383
Well, couldn't you get another job?

652
01:21:12,090 --> 01:21:13,716
Why would I want another job?

653
01:21:13,798 --> 01:21:17,216
Don't you think it's wrong
to be rounding up siblings?

654
01:21:17,298 --> 01:21:19,674
Have you ever set foot
in the lower sectors?

655
01:21:20,465 --> 01:21:24,841
I mean, most of these kids that we pick up,
they live in really shitty conditions.

656
01:21:24,923 --> 01:21:27,841
Trust me, we're doing them a favor.

657
01:21:27,923 --> 01:21:30,008
By sending them off to the cryobank?

658
01:21:33,090 --> 01:21:35,383
Yeah. For now.

659
01:21:35,965 --> 01:21:37,258
Until we see better days.

660
01:21:44,132 --> 01:21:45,133
See you later?

661
01:21:48,215 --> 01:21:51,758
I have some... work stuff to catch up on.

662
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:59,799
- Let's meet on our usual day.
- We talked about this, right?

663
01:22:01,715 --> 01:22:03,424
I just wanna be with you every day.

664
01:22:05,298 --> 01:22:06,758
Not just Monday.

665
01:22:10,340 --> 01:22:11,341
See you, babe.

666
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:35,299
So, Monday's been seeing Adrian for months.

667
01:22:35,382 --> 01:22:38,008
Miss Perfect likes to be choked during sex.

668
01:22:38,090 --> 01:22:39,466
Can you believe it?

669
01:22:40,465 --> 01:22:41,966
Cayman is holding her hostage.

670
01:22:42,548 --> 01:22:45,299
What? Monday's alive?

671
01:22:45,382 --> 01:22:46,466
Yeah.

672
01:22:46,548 --> 01:22:50,424
Be careful, Saturday.
This Bureau agent could be playing us.

673
01:22:55,007 --> 01:22:57,508
I... I don't know.

674
01:23:02,298 --> 01:23:05,674
I don't think so. I'm scared, Thursday.

675
01:23:06,673 --> 01:23:09,258
- What are we gonna do?
- We're gonna get through this.

676
01:23:10,298 --> 01:23:12,549
Every day we set foot outside,
we beat the odds.

677
01:23:14,007 --> 01:23:17,799
We're gonna get Monday out, and we're gonna
show the world who Cayman really is.

678
01:24:03,590 --> 01:24:04,591
I love...

679
01:24:35,673 --> 01:24:38,758
- We gotta go!
- No! It's everything.

680
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:41,508
- Our whole life is in here.
- There's no time.

681
01:24:41,590 --> 01:24:43,841
This is the only proof we ever existed.

682
01:24:43,923 --> 01:24:47,508
Come on. Forget it. We gotta go. Okay?

683
01:24:49,548 --> 01:24:50,383
Okay.

684
01:24:53,423 --> 01:24:54,841
Here, put it over your face.

685
01:25:00,382 --> 01:25:01,383
Come on!

686
01:25:09,590 --> 01:25:11,591
Come on!

687
01:25:25,215 --> 01:25:26,716
Come on, Friday.

688
01:25:37,965 --> 01:25:40,049
Friday, what are you doing?

689
01:25:42,673 --> 01:25:43,716
Friday!

690
01:25:46,715 --> 01:25:48,091
Friday, what the fuck?

691
01:25:53,090 --> 01:25:55,299
Friday, get down here now! Please!

692
01:26:00,215 --> 01:26:01,591
Friday!

693
01:26:41,632 --> 01:26:43,174
Friday, get down, please.

694
01:26:45,715 --> 01:26:48,091
I synched everything to your bracelet.

695
01:26:48,173 --> 01:26:49,091
What?

696
01:26:49,173 --> 01:26:51,133
Go and get Monday.

697
01:26:51,215 --> 01:26:54,966
Show Cayman who Karen Settman really is.

698
01:26:55,048 --> 01:26:57,258
What are you talking about?
Please, there's still time!

699
01:27:00,757 --> 01:27:04,299
It's okay. I'm not like the rest of you.

700
01:27:07,382 --> 01:27:09,633
As crazy and dysfunctional
as our family was,

701
01:27:09,715 --> 01:27:11,466
I needed it to survive.

702
01:27:12,048 --> 01:27:13,466
I couldn't make it out there.

703
01:27:14,548 --> 01:27:15,716
Not without you guys.

704
01:27:15,798 --> 01:27:18,133
Friday, get down here now! Please!

705
01:27:25,423 --> 01:27:26,758
Friday!

706
01:27:27,340 --> 01:27:28,841
It's time to unplug, big sis.

707
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:43,216
I love you.

708
01:28:52,590 --> 01:28:54,468
Zulu Victor One to Bravo Delta.

709
01:28:54,548 --> 01:28:56,341
Zulu Victor One to Bravo Delta.

710
01:28:56,423 --> 01:29:00,924
Reports of an explosion.
25 Alexander Plaza. Multiple causalities.

711
01:29:01,007 --> 01:29:04,841
I repeat, 25 Alexander Plaza.
Multiple casualties. Please respond.

712
01:29:35,257 --> 01:29:36,258
Move! Move!

713
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:42,299
Another one coming your way.

714
01:29:42,382 --> 01:29:44,591
- Authorization?
- Full clearance.

715
01:29:45,507 --> 01:29:46,883
- You know the drill.
- Yes, sir.

716
01:29:56,840 --> 01:29:57,674
Karen?

717
01:29:57,757 --> 01:29:59,427
- Step back, please.
- Get him out of here.

718
01:29:59,507 --> 01:30:02,674
Is it Karen? Let me see her.
Let me see her! Let me see her!

719
01:30:02,757 --> 01:30:05,133
Let me see her! Karen!

720
01:30:06,007 --> 01:30:07,008
Ka...

721
01:30:27,132 --> 01:30:28,424
Don't move!

722
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:31,841
Don't move!

723
01:30:33,757 --> 01:30:34,758
What the fuck?

724
01:30:36,007 --> 01:30:37,591
You sold us out.

725
01:30:39,382 --> 01:30:40,841
You son of a bitch!

726
01:30:42,507 --> 01:30:43,508
Karen?

727
01:30:45,090 --> 01:30:46,633
K-Karen?

728
01:30:46,715 --> 01:30:49,174
Who are you? Who are you?

729
01:30:49,257 --> 01:30:53,508
Stop your fucking games! You know who I am.

730
01:30:59,382 --> 01:31:01,258
Jesus Christ, you're a sibling.

731
01:31:03,757 --> 01:31:04,758
Yeah.

732
01:31:06,007 --> 01:31:07,091
One of seven.

733
01:31:08,298 --> 01:31:10,299
Identical in every way.

734
01:31:13,465 --> 01:31:14,466
Well...

735
01:31:16,215 --> 01:31:17,341
not in every way.

736
01:31:18,548 --> 01:31:19,549
Karen...

737
01:31:20,757 --> 01:31:22,258
I saw her in a body bag.

738
01:31:22,340 --> 01:31:24,633
- Not her.
- She was in my apartment last night.

739
01:31:24,715 --> 01:31:26,883
- She was in my apartment. I saw her.
- Not her.

740
01:31:26,965 --> 01:31:29,633
- She was in my apartment!
- It wasn't her! She's not dead.

741
01:31:31,882 --> 01:31:32,883
She's alive.

742
01:31:47,257 --> 01:31:48,258
I love...

743
01:31:55,507 --> 01:31:59,299
I have nothing to do with it.
You have to trust me. I love Karen.

744
01:32:11,257 --> 01:32:12,966
Cayman is holding her hostage.

745
01:32:14,548 --> 01:32:15,549
If you love her...

746
01:32:17,215 --> 01:32:18,508
if you really love her...

747
01:32:19,673 --> 01:32:21,091
you gotta help me.

748
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:28,841
You have a plan?

749
01:32:32,632 --> 01:32:33,716
I am the plan.

750
01:32:54,548 --> 01:32:56,109
Yeah, they're expecting you downstairs.

751
01:33:53,298 --> 01:33:54,466
I'll take it from here.

752
01:34:31,173 --> 01:34:32,174
Will it hurt?

753
01:34:34,048 --> 01:34:35,049
No.

754
01:36:07,298 --> 01:36:08,591
I thought there was a fire.

755
01:36:15,257 --> 01:36:16,258
Fuck.

756
01:36:23,882 --> 01:36:24,883
No, no! No! No!

757
01:36:32,298 --> 01:36:34,591
No! No, no! No!

758
01:36:34,673 --> 01:36:39,466
Help me! Let me out!
Help me! Please let me out!

759
01:36:54,592 --> 01:36:55,843
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

760
01:37:20,925 --> 01:37:22,843
It was all a lie.

761
01:37:26,175 --> 01:37:27,718
Cayman killed them all.

762
01:37:33,675 --> 01:37:34,926
Every sibling.

763
01:38:18,092 --> 01:38:19,093
Okay.

764
01:38:38,092 --> 01:38:39,634
Hey.

765
01:38:43,342 --> 01:38:44,343
Karen.

766
01:38:44,425 --> 01:38:45,634
Tuesday.

767
01:38:46,425 --> 01:38:48,509
- No, please! Please, no, please!
- It's me. It's me.

768
01:38:48,592 --> 01:38:50,676
- Please, no, please!
- It's not her.

769
01:38:56,592 --> 01:38:59,426
Shh...

770
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:02,426
It's okay. Shh...

771
01:39:02,508 --> 01:39:05,426
Shh...

772
01:39:06,300 --> 01:39:08,593
We're gonna get you out. Okay?

773
01:39:08,675 --> 01:39:11,884
Where's Karen?
Is she still alive? Where's Karen?

774
01:39:14,425 --> 01:39:15,634
What happened to Monday?

775
01:39:21,758 --> 01:39:22,759
Ah...

776
01:39:24,050 --> 01:39:25,051
Karen.

777
01:39:25,550 --> 01:39:29,843
How are you enjoying your stay?
I trust we've made you comfortable.

778
01:39:31,217 --> 01:39:32,259
More than comfortable.

779
01:39:33,883 --> 01:39:37,259
We failed miserably
as a species on this planet.

780
01:39:37,842 --> 01:39:39,884
Masterminding our own extinction.

781
01:39:41,258 --> 01:39:46,134
But, through it all, through your donation
and my push for Parliament,

782
01:39:46,217 --> 01:39:49,718
we might just still have another chance.

783
01:39:59,092 --> 01:40:00,093
Take your wig off.

784
01:40:04,175 --> 01:40:05,176
Take it off!

785
01:40:10,217 --> 01:40:12,718
If you're beginning to
have second thoughts,

786
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:16,301
you should know that I've kept
one of your siblings alive as collateral.

787
01:40:17,300 --> 01:40:18,759
And, after all...

788
01:40:19,342 --> 01:40:23,134
anyone who's willing to sacrifice
their own flesh and blood...

789
01:40:23,967 --> 01:40:25,801
can never be fully trusted.

790
01:40:36,842 --> 01:40:37,843
So...

791
01:40:39,092 --> 01:40:43,218
how does it feel to be the one
and only Karen Settman?

792
01:40:50,383 --> 01:40:53,759
When you get into the main server,
use the code Friday wrote.

793
01:40:53,842 --> 01:40:55,551
Cayman's speech starts in 15 minutes.

794
01:40:57,717 --> 01:41:01,134
- Let's go.
- Let's take this bitch down.

795
01:41:48,342 --> 01:41:49,343
Fuck.

796
01:41:53,300 --> 01:41:55,259
Nobody moves!

797
01:41:58,883 --> 01:42:00,176
Show me your hands!

798
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:02,801
Open the door!

799
01:42:04,383 --> 01:42:07,801
- Open the fucking now or I'll shoot him!
- Do it! Do it.

800
01:43:35,217 --> 01:43:36,218
Monday.

801
01:43:40,508 --> 01:43:41,551
I'm impressed.

802
01:43:42,883 --> 01:43:45,384
You've never worn Karen Settman so well.

803
01:43:49,717 --> 01:43:53,343
- You think you own her. You don't.
- I do her justice.

804
01:43:55,092 --> 01:43:56,093
You only pretend.

805
01:44:03,425 --> 01:44:07,926
Thank you for coming this evening.
I'm deeply honored and grateful.

806
01:44:12,592 --> 01:44:15,926
I gotta get to Cayman.
Get her away from the servers.

807
01:44:29,133 --> 01:44:30,343
You sold us out.

808
01:44:31,717 --> 01:44:32,926
How could you?

809
01:44:33,758 --> 01:44:36,593
I thought you, of all people,
would understand.

810
01:44:37,258 --> 01:44:40,093
Understand? We were your family.

811
01:44:40,175 --> 01:44:41,926
What do you know about family?

812
01:44:45,133 --> 01:44:49,051
All these years of endless lectures
on responsibility and sacrifice?

813
01:44:49,550 --> 01:44:52,343
I never saw you do any of it, not once.

814
01:44:55,467 --> 01:44:57,384
I did everything I was told.

815
01:44:58,258 --> 01:44:59,551
Everything right.

816
01:44:59,633 --> 01:45:01,968
I did everything I could
to protect our family.

817
01:45:04,300 --> 01:45:06,009
You have a funny way of showing it.

818
01:45:11,925 --> 01:45:14,218
Sunday died in my arms.

819
01:45:17,842 --> 01:45:19,634
Wednesday fell to her death.

820
01:45:19,717 --> 01:45:22,634
Saturday was shot in the
head, and Friday...

821
01:45:30,633 --> 01:45:32,218
I didn't plan this.

822
01:45:36,133 --> 01:45:38,134
I met Adrian and I fell in love.

823
01:45:40,342 --> 01:45:41,634
And things changed.

824
01:45:43,383 --> 01:45:47,218
- I made a deal with Cayman, and...
- it got out of my control.

825
01:45:50,675 --> 01:45:51,676
I'm sorry.

826
01:45:57,467 --> 01:46:00,593
I'm sorry you...
you lost your finger because of me.

827
01:46:02,342 --> 01:46:04,843
I was a... I was a total fuck-up.

828
01:46:06,883 --> 01:46:09,593
If I could go back
and change it all, I would.

829
01:46:14,133 --> 01:46:15,551
Karen Settman...

830
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:19,093
was so much more than any one of us.

831
01:46:21,592 --> 01:46:22,843
She was all of us.

832
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:28,009
She was our family.

833
01:46:33,717 --> 01:46:35,468
I was the firstborn.

834
01:46:37,175 --> 01:46:39,134
Karen Settman was always mine.

835
01:46:40,717 --> 01:46:41,718
The rest of you?

836
01:46:42,758 --> 01:46:44,593
You were just afterbirth.

837
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:59,759
For three decades,
the Child Allocation Bureau has combatted

838
01:46:59,842 --> 01:47:04,384
the most serious crisis
our world has ever faced.

839
01:47:04,467 --> 01:47:06,926
Catastrophic overpopulation.

840
01:47:11,550 --> 01:47:14,218
Critics may chastise our methods,

841
01:47:14,842 --> 01:47:17,509
but the numbers don't lie.

842
01:47:31,883 --> 01:47:38,093
In a perfect world,
every child has the right to live.

843
01:47:47,842 --> 01:47:50,634
That's why I'm running for office.

844
01:47:51,383 --> 01:47:53,634
So I can reform the law.

845
01:48:22,425 --> 01:48:26,051
Anyone who wants to bring a child
into this world

846
01:48:26,133 --> 01:48:30,134
must be able to prove
financial stability...

847
01:48:33,842 --> 01:48:35,218
and be able to guarantee

848
01:48:35,300 --> 01:48:39,676
the emotional and physical
well-being of that child.

849
01:48:46,925 --> 01:48:49,551
There may even be room for siblings...

850
01:48:51,133 --> 01:48:53,134
if the data measures up.

851
01:49:06,092 --> 01:49:07,884
So I commend you for your vision

852
01:49:08,467 --> 01:49:13,343
as we continue to take positive action
to build a sustainable future

853
01:49:13,425 --> 01:49:15,676
full of hope and possibility.

854
01:49:21,800 --> 01:49:22,884
Together...

855
01:49:27,050 --> 01:49:28,051
we will...

856
01:49:32,633 --> 01:49:33,509
Survive.

857
01:50:04,258 --> 01:50:05,259
Are you okay?

858
01:50:22,592 --> 01:50:23,593
Hit it.

859
01:51:20,883 --> 01:51:22,259
They didn't suffer.

860
01:51:23,633 --> 01:51:24,801
No, they didn't suffer.

861
01:51:25,592 --> 01:51:29,801
They didn't suffer. They didn't suffer!

862
01:51:47,675 --> 01:51:48,843
What have you done?

863
01:51:50,675 --> 01:51:51,968
What have you done?

864
01:52:48,842 --> 01:52:49,843
Monday.

865
01:52:52,092 --> 01:52:53,634
I need you to be brave.

866
01:52:54,008 --> 01:52:56,051
Set an example for your sisters.

867
01:53:36,883 --> 01:53:38,426
I'm just trying to protect you.

868
01:53:45,508 --> 01:53:47,176
I'm so sorry.

869
01:54:26,133 --> 01:54:27,134
Promise me...

870
01:54:33,467 --> 01:54:35,384
Don't let them take them.

871
01:54:43,633 --> 01:54:45,176
Don't let them take them.

872
01:55:15,217 --> 01:55:17,593
Hey, baby. Hey, baby.

873
01:55:18,592 --> 01:55:19,593
Stay with me, okay?

874
01:55:22,008 --> 01:55:23,009
Oh...

875
01:55:27,258 --> 01:55:31,134
Baby, you're okay. Baby. Baby.

876
01:55:50,758 --> 01:55:55,259
Federation-wide rioting has forced
the repeal of the Child Allocation Act.

877
01:55:55,800 --> 01:55:59,509
Hundreds of siblings held
in processing centers have been released.

878
01:56:00,217 --> 01:56:02,968
Pregnant women
are coming out of hiding in droves,

879
01:56:03,050 --> 01:56:05,176
the majority from poorest districts.

880
01:56:05,633 --> 01:56:06,801
Without this repeal,

881
01:56:06,883 --> 01:56:10,218
many of these children would
have been discarded or processed

882
01:56:10,300 --> 01:56:12,176
the minute they were born.

883
01:56:18,050 --> 01:56:20,968
This planet is the only home
you will ever know.

884
01:56:23,633 --> 01:56:24,634
So, look around.

885
01:56:25,925 --> 01:56:27,093
Ask yourselves.

886
01:56:30,050 --> 01:56:33,593
Who will continue to make
the difficult decisions

887
01:56:33,675 --> 01:56:35,301
that will ensure your survival?

888
01:56:38,758 --> 01:56:39,759
My regret...

889
01:56:43,675 --> 01:56:46,759
My regret is that your children
will never know

890
01:56:46,842 --> 01:56:49,259
the world we could have built together.

891
01:56:51,133 --> 01:56:52,926
That hope is gone forever.

892
01:57:04,317 --> 01:57:06,009
I like your new eye, Tuesday.

893
01:57:09,300 --> 01:57:11,593
- They did a good job.
- Thank you.

894
01:57:14,467 --> 01:57:17,593
Oh, it's not Tuesday anymore. It's Terry.

895
01:57:17,675 --> 01:57:20,426
Okay. Terry.

896
01:57:26,508 --> 01:57:27,509
So...

897
01:57:29,717 --> 01:57:30,718
what should I call you?

898
01:57:34,175 --> 01:57:35,176
Karen.

899
01:57:37,800 --> 01:57:38,801
Karen Settman.

900
01:57:49,633 --> 01:57:51,634
Monday did it all for them.

901
01:57:52,883 --> 01:57:54,384
She wanted them to be safe.

902
01:57:57,800 --> 01:57:59,218
Well...

903
01:58:00,633 --> 01:58:02,051
they will be.
