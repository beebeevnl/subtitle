1
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,151
<i>Everyone was warned,
but no one listened.</i>

2
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,609
<i>A rise in temperature...</i>

3
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,603
<i>Ocean patterns changed...</i>

4
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,606
<i>And ice caps melted.</i>

5
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,402
<i>They called it
extreme weather.</i>

6
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,165
<i>They didn't know
what "extreme" was.</i>

7
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,690
<i>In the year of 2019...</i>

8
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,604
<i>Hurricanes...</i>

9
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,046
Tornadoes...

10
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,565
<i>Floods...</i>

11
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,960
<i>And droughts...</i>

12
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,051
<i>Unleashed a wave of destruction
upon our planet.</i>

13
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,647
<i>We didn't just lose towns...</i>

14
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,165
<i>Or beachfronts.</i>

15
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,011
<i>We lost entire cities.</i>

16
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,126
<i>The East River swallowed
Lower Manhattan.</i>

17
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,680
<i>A heat wave killed
two million people in Madrid...</i>

18
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,371
<i>In just one day.</i>

19
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,721
<i>But in that moment...</i>

20
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,407
<i>Facing our own extinction...</i>

21
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,648
<i>It became clear that no single nation
could solve this problem alone.</i>

22
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,082
<i>The world came together as one...</i>

23
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,402
<i>And we fought back.</i>

24
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,850
<i>Scientists from 17 countries...</i>

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,445
<i>Led by the U.S. and China...</i>

26
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,685
<i>Worked tirelessly.</i>

27
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,365
<i>Not as representatives
of their nations...</i>

28
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,849
<i>But of humanity.</i>

29
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,722
<i>They found a way
to neutralize the storms...</i>

30
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,769
<i>With a net of
thousands of satellites,</i>

31
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,641
<i>each deploying countermeasures designed
to impact the basic elements of weather,</i>

32
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,769
<i>heat, pressure, and water.</i>

33
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,123
<i>All overseen
by the International Space Station.</i>

34
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,208
<i>They gave the satellite net
a technical name...</i>

35
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,488
<i>But we all came
to call it Dutch Boy...</i>

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,447
<i>After the story of the child
who plugged a dam with his finger.</i>

37
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,848
<i>This is what saved us all.</i>

38
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,211
<i>And it was built by</i> a <i>team
led by one</i> man...

39
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,607
<i>My father.</i>

40
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,961
-Thank you.
-Keep the change.

41
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,525
Jake Lawson. I have a Senate--

42
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,846
Senate hearing in room 12.

43
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,002
Yeah.

44
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,206
Lawson?

45
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,050
-You're the Dutch Boy guy, right?
-Yeah.

46
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,440
Man, I need to shake your hand.

47
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,846
Oh. Okay.

48
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,010
Tornado? Zap!

49
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,924
Blizzard? Zap!

50
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,047
Monsoon?

51
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,401
-Zap?
-Zap!

52
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,247
Everybody down here owes you,
Jake Lawson.

53
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,926
If you need anything, you just ask.

54
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,924
<i>The Senate Committee
assigned to oversee Dutch Boy</i>

55
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,606
<i>will now hear from Jacob Lawson...</i>

56
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,889
<i>Climate ISS Chief Operations
Coordinator.</i>

57
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,442
<i>May the record reflect
that he was nearly one hour late.</i>

58
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,884
<i>Yeah, sorry about that.</i>

59
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,121
<i>l literally had to
fly in from outer space.</i>

60
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,961
Oh, here we go.

61
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,250
<i>Mr. Lawson, we find ourselves
heading toward a crossroads.</i>

62
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,324
<i>As you know, as per
UN Resolution 28-14,</i>

63
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,166
<i>the United States will be
handing over control of Dutch Boy</i>

64
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,563
<i>to an International Oversight Committee
in three years.</i>

65
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,690
<i>This in spite of the fact
that we actually built the thing.</i>

66
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,049
<i>Excuse me, Senator.
I don't wanna slow things down.</i>

67
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,771
<i>You said "we" built it?</i>

68
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,610
<i>Yes, indeed, I did.</i>

69
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,041
<i>Because I know what I did. I'm the guy
who led the team that built the station.</i>

70
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,725
<i>I was up there with an international
crew of 600 people, not just Americans.</i>

71
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,010
<i>And I know all of their faces,
but I don't remember yours.</i>

72
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,045
<i>We had a plumber up there.
He looked a little like you.</i>

73
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,283
<i>--Very clever, Mr. Lawson.</i>

74
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,046
<i>Dutch Boy was an international effort</i>

75
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,766
<i>- and, yes, it may, one day, very well...</i>

76
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,041
<i>...belong to the world.</i>

77
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,483
<i>But until it does,
we have authority over its operation</i>

78
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,927
<i>and we have authority over you!</i>

79
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,401
<i>And you have been flouting
that authority.</i>

80
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,245
<i>I have report after report here.</i>

81
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,767
<i>Failure to follow procedures...</i>

82
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,968
<i>Numerous violations
of the chain of command.</i>

83
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,283
<i>Then, there was the incident where you
punched a federal inspector in the face.</i>

84
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,244
<i>Well, your federal inspector
doesn't know</i>

85
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,210
<i>that a capacitor holds a charge
even when it's disconnected.</i>

86
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,046
<i>He was grabbing for the damn thing.
I saved his life!</i>

87
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,688
<i>You can make all the excuses
you want, Mr. Lawson,</i>

88
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,366
<i>but there's one thing you cannot defend.</i>

89
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,484
<i>And that would be the day
you brought Dutch Boy online...</i>

90
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,805
<i>...and operational without our consent!</i>

91
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,326
<i>And what would that have taken, Senator?</i>

92
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,044
<i>There were a series of storms building
in Southeast Asia and the North Atlantic</i>

93
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,646
<i>that would have killed
tens of thousands of people.</i>

94
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,481
<i>Dutch Boy was ready. We went green.</i>

95
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,130
It works. You're welcome.

96
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,688
<i>Mr. Lawson, if you continue
to defy our authority...</i>

97
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,844
<i>Dutch Boy will go on without you!</i>

98
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,484
<i>Am I making myself clear?</i>

99
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,401
<i>Yes.</i>

100
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,480
<i>Good. Oh, and one more thing.</i>

101
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,890
<i>To ensure compliance, this committee
will be sending up new support staff.</i>

102
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,364
<i>Naturally, when they get there, you'll
have to send some of your people home.</i>

103
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,611
<i>We'll leave those choices up to you.</i>

104
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,969
<i>Senator, respectfully,
my crew didn't do anything wrong.</i>

105
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,282
<i>Excuse me,
I'm not asking for your input.</i>

106
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,683
<i>These people left their homes
and their families</i>

107
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,126
<i>and risked their lives
to save this planet.</i>

108
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,247
<i>This hearing is adjourned.</i>

109
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,681
<i>I'm not cutting a single one
of those people loose!</i>

110
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,841
<i>Excuse me?</i>

111
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,088
<i>People like you need people like me.
You know why?</i>

112
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,483
<i>So you can take credit
for everything we accomplish.</i>

113
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,688
<i>So you can go to your constituents
and your cronies...</i>

114
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,046
<i>This meeting is adjourned.</i>

115
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,051
...and <i>your mistresses
and puff out your chest</i>

116
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,770
<i>- and say, "Hey, look at me!"
- Sit down, please!</i>

117
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,729
<i>-Well, I'm looking, Senator.
-Excuse me.</i>

118
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,246
<i>-We're all looking.
-This meeting is adjourned.</i>

119
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,370
<i>This meeting is adjourned! Thank you.

120
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,608
Well, that was going well, huh?

121
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,001
Up to a point.

122
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,607
No, Jake, that didn't go well
at any point.

123
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,208
But, hey, what are you good at,
little brother, huh?

124
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,203
Like working the angles,
smoothing ruffled feathers?

125
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,600
You can fix it. You always do.

126
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,925
It's like a talent.

127
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,884
It is a talent.

128
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,046
Of a sort.

129
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,247
I wish I could help you.
I really do.

130
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,846
But it's not that simple,

131
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,366
not this time.

132
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,161
Why not?

133
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:56,168
Well, as of last week,
they have put me in charge of Dutch Boy.

134
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,602
Well, that's great!

135
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,081
That's great! You kidding me?

136
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,646
You're kidding me.

137
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,731
Look, what do you want me to do? Huh?

138
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,566
You leave me no choice. I told you
this had to go well, and it didn't.

139
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,841
I'm sorry, Jake.

140
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,605
You're fired.

141
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,846
Jesus. It's over 120 in this mother.

142
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,241
Fan out.

143
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,406
Hi, Agent Wilson.

144
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,483
Assistant Secretary Lawson.

145
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,049
Oh, you look nice today.

146
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,487
I'm wearing the same thing
I always wear.

147
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,001
Not exactly.

148
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,970
Have you seen I, well, got on a new tie?

149
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:30,407
I observed. We're trained to notice
any disturbing details.

150
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,928
-Sarah, come on.
-Assistant Secretary Lawson...

151
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,890
I'm not permitted to engage in
casual conversation while I'm at a post.

152
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,325
We are being watched.

153
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,483
We're always being watched.

154
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,641
Well, if we're always being watched,
what's the point of hiding anything?

155
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,281
You're interfering with my duties.
I'd rather not shoot you.

156
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,371
Well, it would be an honor
to be the first person that you kill.

157
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,930
Hang on.

158
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,567
What is it?

159
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,411
Uh, the president's called
a security briefing.

160
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,405
It was not on the schedule,
so I guess I'm now on duty.

161
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,522
I like the tie. Home by 7:00. Love you.

162
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,525
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.

163
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,647
I didn't say anything.

164
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,284
Move along, sir.

165
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,606
Yes, ma'am.

166
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,721
<i>What the hell happened here?</i>

167
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,450
One of our thermospheric satellites

168
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,409
malfunctioned over Afghanistan.

169
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,290
<i>A UN recon team found it, Mr. President.</i>

170
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,568
And the members of the Climate Council,
they're aware?

171
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,768
Yes, and they've all agreed
to keep the incident discreet.

172
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,327
But with this many people in the loop,
I'm not sure how long it's gonna keep.

173
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,129
And we're sure this was caused
by Dutch Boy?

174
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,282
Absolutely.

175
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,808
Can we assume that this is
an isolated incident? Doctor Quigley?

176
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,126
We're fairly certain, yes.

177
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,722
It's great to know
that you're "fairly certain."

178
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,206
This is a serious malfunction.

179
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,691
So your proposal is what?

180
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,008
Simple. We shut down
all Central Asian satellites

181
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,400
<i>until we know what went wrong.</i>

182
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,886
-Are you serious?
-Yes, I'm serious.

183
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,725
Know how difficult it was to get every
one of these nations online for this?

184
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,370
<i>We have worked extremely hard</i>

185
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,161
to assure these nations that this
system will protect them, and it has.

186
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,044
And let's not forget, people,
it's an election year.

187
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,361
We shut Dutch Boy down,
the press is gonna jump all over this.

188
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,521
Oh, my <i>God!</i>

189
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,364
300 people died in that village.

190
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,804
I mean, who gives a damn
about the politics of it all?

191
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,687
Look, we cost those people their lives.

192
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,691
<i>The only thing we should be concerned
about here is how to fix it</i>

193
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,845
and making sure it never happens again.

194
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,048
And how do you propose we do that?

195
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,049
We can't do anything.

196
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,930
What I mean is, the problem is
not gonna be solved in this room

197
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,242
and, well, certainly not by us.

198
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,922
No, no, we need an international team
on the station itself.

199
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,366
You know, not suits.

200
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,170
<i>Engineers, coders, builders</i>

201
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,408
doing a comprehensive systems check,

202
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,722
no matter the cost,
no matter the politics,

203
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,723
and we need 'em up there now.

204
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,444
We are set to transfer full authority
for Dutch Boy

205
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,365
<i>to the international community
in two weeks.</i>

206
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,921
I will not be the president
that hands over damaged goods.

207
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,491
Not now, not ever.

208
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,930
So we are gonna handle this problem
and its solution in-house,

209
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,971
and we are gonna send up one man.

210
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,649
One of our own, who reports only to us
and that we can control.

211
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,160
<i>Understood?</i>

212
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,971
So find me that someone.

213
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,761
Now.

214
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,491
Yes, sir.

215
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,529
Look, I know you're not gonna like it,
but as I see it,

216
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,045
there's only one person
to go after for this.

217
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,845
Your brother, Jake.

218
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:30,928
Come on, not Jake.

219
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,645
17 countries, hmm?

220
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,531
17 countries had teams working on
Dutch Boy. They all reported to him.

221
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,001
Nobody knows what's under the hood
better than him.

222
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,482
Come on. Can we weigh other options?

223
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,244
Max, how long have you known me?

224
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,124
Ever since I was transferred
to the State Department.

225
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,089
That's right. I handpicked you.

226
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,290
I believed in you. You're smart.

227
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,682
And I was right about you.

228
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,247
I'm right about Jake.

229
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,530
If this is gonna be a problem...

230
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,691
No, sir.

231
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,046
Good.

232
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:25,081
<i>Afghan satellite

<i>Airlock doors secured.</i>

00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,644
I want a full dissection

00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,807

I will take care of this.

243
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,729
Make sure they depressurize
the fuel intake.

244
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,847
Yeah, we got it, man.

245
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,371
Makmoud. Oi, Makmoud!

246
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,211
I'm about to obliterate
your top score here, pal.

247
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,322
I have to do some reprogramming.

248
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,646
Oh, come on!

249
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,122
He's got no pride of ownership,

00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,606
Hey! What you doing up there?

254
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,887
<i>What is that? A solar generator?</i>

255
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,442
Dual axis sun-tracking solar generator.
Replacing the power converter.

256
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,966
on, God!

257
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,402
You're getting more like your dad
every day.

258
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,607
Hey, where'd he find that?

259
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,924
Are you seriously asking that question?

260
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,967
Oh, of course.

261
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,049

Okay, what's going on here?

266
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,331
All right, this is freaking me out.
You're supposed to be nine years old.

Thirteen.

268

Ouch!

271
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,767
So what's going on here?
You living with him now?

272
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,045
He gets me two weekends a month.

Your dad and I were your age,

Hey, look, you take care.

What's with all the car parts?

289
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:57,044
I build electric motors

It's a little early, don't you think?

295
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,567
I got fired by my own brother.

296
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,286

<i>my house, my dog,</i>

298

301
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,722
There's something wrong with Dutch Boy.

No, there isn't.

303

Well, an entire village of

Yeah.

305
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:42,083
And then yesterday,
an airlock just opened by itself.

306
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,645
We lost one of our crew.

307
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,444
Dutch Boy is not my problem anymore.

308
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,091
That I am calling bullshit on.

309
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,730
'Cause other than your daughter

00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,407
Well, then, what are you doing
living out here?

316
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,250
Hmm?

317
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,327
Look, I know you think I'm a weasel,

318
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,404
someone who just moves pieces
around a chessboard for a living.

319
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,847
Well, guess what, yeah. Yeah, I am.

320
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:29,201
But that is how you get 17 countries
to agree to build a space station.

321
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,011
Now, you build things, right?

322
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,128
And there is something wrong
with the thing that you built,

323
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,487
<i>and people are dying.</i>

324
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,486
If you really think you're the best,
which I know that you do,

325
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,362
then how the hell
can you stand there and say no?

326
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,320
I'll be taking orders from someone,
I suppose.

327
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,967
Yeah.

328
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,370
So what? ls that a yes?

329
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,005
Long as it's not you, yeah.

330
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,888
<i>Hey, this is Max.
Leave a <i>message.</i>

331
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,251
You got any room in there for me?

332
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,165
Whoa!

333
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:02,848
Whoa!

334
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,686
Okay.

335
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,445
I think this is everything.

336
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,002
I made you a packed lunch as well.

337
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,647
Did you hear about the gas main
explosions in Hong Kong?

338
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,484
Yeah, it just hit the news.

339
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,767
It's terrible.

340
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,247
Was it anything like what happened
in Afghanistan?

341
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,448
No, nothing happened in Afghanistan.

342
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,280
Are you going back up to space?

343
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,409
-No.
-Yes, you are!

344
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,205
You're leaving today to fix Dutch Boy.

345
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,131
What did I tell you
about eavesdropping?

346
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,089
You've never told me anything
about eavesdropping.

347
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,890
You don't really do much parenting.

348
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,521
How do you know it's safe?

349
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,762
Of course it's safe.
I've been up there 100 times.

350
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,846
Don't treat me like I'm a child.
Someone died!

351
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,650
- It was an accident.
- Someone got sucked out!

352
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,609
It was an accident.

353
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:24,160
See, that's what I'm going up there
to fix, okay? You don't have to worry.

354
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,363
Hey, think of it like I'm going
on a vacation for a week or two.

355
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,082
To a place 250 miles straight up

356
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,567
and -450 degrees?

357
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,041
Some holiday.

358
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,526
Yeah, you got a point.

359
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,250
Why'd Uncle Max fire you?

360
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,401
Unbelievable!

361
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,521
Did you do something wrong?

362
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,921
No, look, your Uncle Max and me...

363
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,162
It's not just about the one job.

364
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,441
You know, sometimes,
younger brothers resent being younger.

365
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,568
So they get bossy.
They think they know everything.

366
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,882
They tell you how to act, how to talk,

367
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,767
and after a couple decades,
you just get tired of listening to it.

368
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,923
Maybe you should listen.

369
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,285
My lift is here.

370
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,441
-Gotta go.
-What?

371
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,364
Wait, I thought I was
taking you to the airport.

372
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,761
You really wanna see Mom? Great!

373
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,922
We can all fly home to Atlanta together.

374
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,686
Got it covered.

375
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,490
Quit acting like you're mad.

376
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,088
Hannah, what do you want from me?

377
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,527
I want you to come back alive.

378
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,046
And you're not exactly
the reliable type.

379
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,447
Hey-

380
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,890
I know I haven't always
kept good on my promises,

381
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,570
but I'm coming back.

382
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,324
<i>_|__</i>
-Promise.

383
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,091
I promise.

384
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,442
Come here.

385
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,168
I'll be back soon, okay?

386
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:28,082
<i>OV-104 is now at
T minus one hour and ready for boarding.</i>

387
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,042
<i>We're at T minus one minute

388
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,529
Have a safe trip, sir.

<i>Booster rocket

00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,202
Hate to interrupt, Major Tom,

00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,643
<i>but in a few seconds,
you should be able to see the net.</i>

392
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,450
<i>How's it feel to be back home?</i>

393
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,489
Look at you, girl.

394
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,889
Livin‘ and breathin‘.

395
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,406
Mr. Lawson.

396
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,846
Hey-

397
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,648
Ute Fassbinder.

398
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,041
Nice to meet you.

399
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,810
Yeah, I remember you.

400
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,645
Yeah, you were the German scientist.
You were here when I was here.

401
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,801
Thermospherics, right?

402
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,001
Yeah.

403
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,282
The containment shell needs
a fresh coat of sealant

404
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,920
where the APT ducts push
through the channel housing.

405
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,164
Not good. That's wrong.

406
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,327
And you hear that?

407
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,845
- I'm sorry.
- Shh. Listen.

408
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,726
That wobbly hum?

409
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,203
That's a bad step-down transformer.

410
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,928
All these things,
they have to be watched, cared for.

411
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,810
- Mr. Lawson.
- No, I know. It's not your fault,

412
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,361
but when I left,
everything here was perfect.

413
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:43,642
I need to speak to your Chief Scientist
about the art of giving a shit.

414
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,167
I'm the Chief Scientist.
I've been promoted a year ago.

415
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,485
Right, congratulations.

416
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,285
One of our crew died this week,
Mr. Lawson.

417
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,409
Sorry about the transformer.

418
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,041
Let me introduce you to your team.

419
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,682
Oh, of course, an American.

420
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,009
Actually, my brother and I
were born in the UK, but thank you.

421
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,851
Yeah, but you've got the old
Stars and Stripes on your arm there,

422
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,804
<i>and a cowboy look in your eye.</i>

423
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,884
<i>Oh, no offense.
This is just a serious situation,</i>

424
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,970
and the last thing we need is some
Washington stooge to come supervise us.

425
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,121
Do we, lads?

426
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,445
Well, you got one,

427
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,762
so how about we start
with names and positions?

428
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,126
Mmm-hmm.

429
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,448
Adisa, structural.

430
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:33,042
Duncan Taylor, systems and OS analyst
and loyal British subject.

431
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,808
Hernandez, robotics.

432
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,367
Dussette.

433
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,321
Satcom and security.

434
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,608
And you are?

435
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,322
This is Mr. Jake Lawson.

436
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,766
You're Jake Lawson? The Jake Lawson?

437
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,364
You look much older
than I would've thought.

438
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,567
<i>I</i> mean, you look good---

439
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,245
...but your physical appearance is not,

440
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:05,008
does not match the amount of time
that has elapsed in your life.

441
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,167
Am I getting fired?

442
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,771
Okay, we don't have
a lot of time.

443
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,686
So we have three situations to examine.

444
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:21,209
Afghanistan, the scientist that died
here, and the new incident in Hong Kong.

445
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,284
Hong Kong?
No, that was a gas main explosion.

446
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,601
<i>We all watched that on the telly.</i>

447
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,042
All right, okay.
You just keep believing that.

448
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,805
<i>I, on the other hand,</i>

449
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:33,567
have a mystery that I'd like to solve
and prevent more deaths,

450
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,524
so feel free to join me.

451
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,601
Or not.

452
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,531
<i>MAX". All right, quick question.</i>

453
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,648
<i>Okay, active shooter,</i>

454
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,326
the president and I are both
in the line of fire.

455
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,129
Who do you save first? Me--

456
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,321
The president.

457
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,769
Oh, come on. You could take
a second just to think about that.

458
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,921
Sorry, baby.

459
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,685
Job comes first, same with you.

460
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,330
No, that's not true.

461
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,449
No, I have priorities and you,

462
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,560
you are my priority.

463
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,085
Come on, let's do it.

464
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,163
I kinda want to,

465
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,049
but you just keep talking.

466
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,526
I mean, why do we always
have to be sneaking around?

467
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:19,283
Come on, let's do it. Let's get married.

468
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,926
We can't.

469
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,008
It's against the rules.

470
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,324
One day, baby.

471
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,804
Um, you're gonna get that.

472
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,524
Because your job comes first.

473
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,602
No...

474
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,521
I'm gonna get it 'cause
I don't want it to interfere with this.

475
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,966
See?

476
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,607
Now I might just not save you.

477
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,681
Yeah, hello?

478
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,211
Max, it's Cheng.

479
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,171
Cheng, God, tell me
you're not in Hong Kong.

480
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,651
<i>-Cheng?
-Last night,</i>

481
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:59,003
I was right in the middle of it.
It was horrible. That's why I'm calling.

482
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,401
<i>Phone service just came back on.</i>

483
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,045
Yeah, well, you're lucky to be alive.

484
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,886
<i>- I mean, those gas pipes?
- I'm not so sure that was the cause.</i>

485
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,725
What do you mean? I don't follow.

486
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,083
<i>It was abnormally hot
before the pipes blew.</i>

487
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,010
The satellite sensor
should've recorded it, right?

488
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:15,960
I checked over a dozen times but I can't
access Dutch Boy's Hong Kong satellite.

489
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,041
My access has been blocked.

490
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,685
<i>Check your H0|0Frame.</i>

491
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,048
I don't understand.
We both have clearance.

492
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,321
<i>CHENG". Exactly.</i>

493
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,730
The only people that have authority to
block are in the building you work in.

494
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,724
Wait. What do you mean?

495
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,362
If someone is covering up
a system defect,

496
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,802
there's potential for critical failure
on a global scale.

497
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,122
<i>If Dutch Boy has a catastrophic failure,</i>

498
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,045
it can create something far worse than
the very thing we're trying to prevent,

499
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,406
<i>what we call a geostorm.</i>

500
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,928
What? Slow down, Cheng, all right?
A what?

501
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,400
A geostorm.

502
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,683
Simultaneous catastrophic weather events
triggered all over the globe.

503
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:52,607
<i>Once they pass a minimum threshold, the
storms will start causing new storms,</i>

504
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,411
<i>like a chain reaction,
until they merge together.</i>

505
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,005
It's gotta be a glitch.

506
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,930
<i>I'll give you a call
when I know something.</i>

507
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,367
All right. Thanks.

508
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:09,370
<i>These pipes had not been
well maintained or upgraded in years.</i>

509
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,684
Cheng thinks Hong Kong
has something to do with Dutch Boy.

510
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,326
You know, he's implying
some kind of cover-up.

511
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,643
I just got a text and POTUS
called a last-minute press briefing.

512
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,364
What, you can't stay?

513
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,408
Oh, when duty calls, duty calls.

514
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,206
"Neither rain nor snow
nor gloom of night," right?

515
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,089
Honey, that's the Postal Service.

516
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,085
We're the Secret Service.
Secret Service.

517
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,129
Oh, there's a difference?
Really?

518
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,090
I didn't know that.

519
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,522
<i>Grab his laptop. Let's go.</i>

520
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,125
So the satellite that went rogue
over Afghanistan, what type was that?

521
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,205
That's my fave, actually.
I call it a "rock 'n' roller."

522
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,929
Oh, the SR-22.

523
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,006
Uses sonic waves to slow
molecular movement causing cooling,

524
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,447
but, in that case, freezing. Why?

525
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,443
<i>We don't know.
We checked the satellite's hard drives,</i>

526
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,643
but the logs were wiped clean
by the malfunction.

527
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,722
All right. Let's pull up every
"rock 'n' roller" satellite we have

528
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,850
to see if we can find
any corruption in their logs.

529
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,769
Pull up every "rock 'n' roller"
in the net.

530
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,048
There's gotta be more than
1,000 of them.

531
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,926
Ah, 1,270, to be exact.

532
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,686
And we're gonna scan
each and every one of 'em.

533
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,321
Dana. Hey.

534
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,090
Hey. What are you doing here?

535
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,525
What do you mean,
"What am I doing here"?

536
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,366
I work here. I'm your boss.

537
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,364
Yeah, but what are you doing
down from Mount Olympus

538
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,289
and visiting me in Millennial Village?

539
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,129
Well, I have a bit of a favor
to ask you.

540
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,249
You're the best at what you do.

541
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,283
But I need you to keep this between us.

542
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,086
Okay.

543
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,802
I have a problem with my HoloFrame.

544
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,610
Do I look like a Genius Bar to you?

545
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,481
I'm sorry. I'm sitting here
defending the free world

546
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,324
against state operators
and cyberterrorists,

547
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,887
but Grandpa needs help fixing his phone.

548
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,245
I have a problem trying to get through
to satellite G-22 over Hong Kong.

549
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,164
So a satellite has a bad comm.
That happens.

550
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,165
No. No, not a satellite.

551
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,925
All of them.

552
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,362
Oh.

553
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,807
I am mildly intrigued. Stay.

554
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,930
Okay.

555
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:17,851
It looks like vanilla line disruption,

556
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,970
<i>bad server relay, or trunk failure,
or something.</i>

557
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,204
Are you still dating
that Secret Service chick?

558
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,482
What? No.

559
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,847
No, I'm not dating anyone.

560
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,607
Mmm-hmm.

561
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,604
<i>Wait, look. Oh, my God.</i>

562
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:38,967
Someone wanted to block your access
without you knowing it was intentional.

563
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,726
But this...

564
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,168
This is very intentional,
and it's very clever.

565
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,651
And I know what you're gonna say.

566
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,888
You're gonna say,
"Tell no one." And I won't.

567
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,521
But I didn't sign up to work here
so I could cubicle-squat 24/7.

568
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,371
So whatever is going on,
I want in on the action.

569
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,530
Well, let's hope there isn't any action.

570
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,360
And yeah,

571
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,563
tell no one.

572
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:10,010
Miss Fassbinder, we've just been given
a priority communication request.

573
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,686
From Climate Command?

574
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,967
The White House.

575
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,527
All right. So who are the yahoos in
Washington we gotta deal with on this?

576
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,682
<i>I guess I would be the head yahoo.</i>

577
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,321
Hello, guys.

578
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:37,166
<i>Max tells me you don't have
a high opinion of politicians.</i>

579
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,890
I didn't say that.

580
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,121
<i>Well, neither do I.</i>

581
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:43,204
<i>We went through hell getting
the world on board for this program.</i>

582
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,051
<i>We've come too far for it to fail.</i>

583
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,883
<i>You and I both understand
why we cannot let that happen.</i>

584
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,286
Yes, sir.

585
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,126
So if I find anything,
I'll report to you right away.

586
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,522
<i>Actually,
you'll be reporting to Max here.</i>

587
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,286
<i>Good luck.</i>

588
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,090
<i>Have at it.</i>

589
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,845
Thank you, sir.

590
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,409
I'll leave you two alone.
And if you need me, I'm in my office.

591
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,210
Thank you.

592
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,009
I'll be reporting to you?

593
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,241
You lied to me.

594
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,606
<i>Again.</i>

595
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,287
No, I just didn't answer
your ridiculous demand.

596
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,601
How do I switch this thing off?

597
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,649
<i>There's something you need to know.</i>

598
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,850
<i>We've been having issues down here
accessing the Dutch Boy satcom.</i>

599
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,649
We have reason to believe that it...

600
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,805
Well, it may not be accidental.

601
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,005
Might not be accidental?

602
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,846
Well, I've been trying to access
the Hong Kong satellite.

603
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:41,084
I knew it. I knew it!

604
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,481
You think it's possible?

605
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,927
Yeah. It's possible.

606
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,326
But even if you could access
the Hong Kong satellite remotely,

607
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,608
you're not gonna get the logs you need.

608
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,487
No. We gotta pull that information
from the actual satellite up here.

609
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,728
Okay. I can authorize that.

610
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,443
I don't need your authorization
for anything.

611
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,722
I'm sure that's really scary for you,

612
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,681
but how about you just count on me
to do my job, and say thank you?

613
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,410
Oh, count on you.

614
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,682
<i>Remember the first time
I had to bail you out?</i>

615
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,683
Oh, God. Jesus Christ!

616
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,281
Yeah, it was just one week
after Mom and Dad died.

617
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,169
You got arrested for fighting. Hmm?

618
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:19,364
<i>That's when I realized that
despite everything I was going through,</i>

619
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,323
<i>I was gonna have
to be responsible for you.</i>

620
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,971
All right, you know what?
Fine. It is what it is.

621
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,362
<i>I guess I got no choice
but to count on you.</i>

622
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,530
But if you ever authorize anything
without my approval,

623
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,847
you'll be on the next shuttle home.

624
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,406
<i>Transmission ended.</i>

625
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:50,729
<i>Hong Kong satellite 022
inbound for examination.</i>

626
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,569
All right.

627
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,848
Let's take this thing apart
and find out what happened in Hong Kong.

628
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,360
Bring it down.

629
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,527
It should have come down by now.

630
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,488
<i>UTE". What is that?</i>

631
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,210
I have no idea.

632
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,965
- All right, shut it down.
- It's not responding.

633
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,121
<i>DUNCAN". Jesus, Hernandez!</i>

634
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,286
Get down!

635
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,371
Get out of here! Go!

636
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,724
Somebody, open this door, now!

637
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,847
Watch out!

638
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:30,961
Shit!

639
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,282
All right, let's pick up
every single piece of this thing

640
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,011
and get it down to manufacturing.

641
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,841
Do you think we can retrieve
the logs from the hard drives?

642
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,002
<i>Well, the accident created
an electrical short</i>

643
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,047
<i>and fried all the drives.</i>

644
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,884
I mean, look at it. It's toast.

645
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,566
So we've lost all the drives
with possible corruption?

646
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,401
Not all of them.

647
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,326
<i>UTE". What do you mean?</i>

648
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:28,446
I was reviewing your video
of the accident that killed Makmoud.

649
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,251
Each of the panels that blew
has a drive inside.

650
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,122
And one of them got stuck
in the communication tower.

651
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,529
It looks like
the seal locks are still intact.

652
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,283
If we're lucky, the corrupted drive
will still be inside.

653
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,649
We gotta get that panel back.

654
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,081
Yeah, hello?

655
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,842
I just got into DC. We have to meet.

656
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,240
I figured it all out.

657
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,041
Meet me at 10:00 at the place across
the square where we used to have lunch.

658
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,122
<i>Back in college.</i>

659
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,601
All right. Yeah, I'll be there.

660
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,730
<i>MAN". Ready to decompress.</i>

661
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,643
All right. Door's open, kids.

662
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,649
You're clear to exit.

663
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:32,326
<i>UTE". Step across the gravity threshold
and follow me.</i>

664
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:35,444
<i>Let's just get the panel,
see what's on those drives.</i>

665
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,051
Okay.

666
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,328
<i>UTE". There's the panel.</i>

667
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:02,525
<i>Wait. Hold up.</i>

668
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,607
<i>We designed the tower
to have emergency de-rig ports</i>

669
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,001
<i>so the bars can be moved easily.</i>

670
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,569
<i>Control, the panel is secured.</i>

671
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,687
<i>Roger</i> that.

672
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,922
Come back now, kids. Come back.

673
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,409
<i>UTE". We're on our way back.</i>

674
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,325
<i>UTE". Jake, what's happening?</i>

675
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:40,565
<i>JAKE". I don't know! I don't know!</i>

676
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,363
<i>UTE". Jake? Jake!</i>

677
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,801
<i>JAKE". I can't control the damn suit!</i>

678
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,122
- What's going on?
- His suit is malfunctioning.

679
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,522
-Jake, do you read me?
-Duncan, tell him to cut it.

680
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,250
Jake, cut off the fuel intake.

681
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,965
<i>JAKE". It's not responding!</i>

682
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:10,767
<i>Hang on, Jake.</i>

683
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,724
<i>JAKE". I can't hold it.</i>

684
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,082
<i>- Eject the pack- Eject the pack!</i>

685
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,689
Oh, Christ. We're gonna lose him.
We're gonna lose him!

686
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,206
Are you all right?

687
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:56,486
Yeah.

688
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,241
You got the drive?

689
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:02,845
<i>I grabbed it when I freed the panel.</i>

690
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,529
You smashed up a dozen comm links,
TCAS sensors...

691
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,564
I'm fine, thank you very much.

692
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,125
What happened out there?

693
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,521
Propulsion throttle locked up.

694
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:22,207
And you lost the door panel,
which means no drive codes.

695
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,124
Back to square one.

696
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,523
Great.

697
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,929
Why didn't you tell them
about the drive?

698
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,282
Because someone just tried to kill me.

699
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:35,886
I know my crew. I trust them.

700
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,810
You think you know them.

701
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,481
But someone doesn't want us
to see what's on this drive.

702
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,608
Jake,
there's no corruption here at all.

703
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,929
The doors weren't accidentally
blown off. They were programmed to.

704
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,446
-This wasn't a malfunction.
-No.

705
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:52,007
Someone intentionally killed Makmoud.

706
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:55,404
No doubt the same person that tampered
with the Hong Kong satellite.

707
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,242
The user logins have been wiped clean.

708
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:00,204
We have no digital fingerprints.

709
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,562
No. That's what they think.

710
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:07,124
Login records are synced back
to the mainframe.

711
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:08,367
Yeah, but that's the problem.

712
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,329
If they're deleted in one place,
they're deleted everywhere.

713
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,244
No, everywhere they know about.

714
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:15,689
When we built Dutch Boy,
we put in a locked off library.

715
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,082
Something that would track
and archive everything.

716
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:22,370
Our saboteur's login info
is gonna be in there.

717
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:26,562
Nope.

718
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,601
You've been locked out.

719
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,046
But by who?

720
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,806
The virtual conference room.

721
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,164
How many have access
to those transmissions?

722
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,647
Anyone with level three access
and above.

723
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,842
Dozens of people.

724
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,086
Max.

725
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,524
-Max.
-What?

726
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,521
Relax. He'll be here soon.

727
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:59,644
What, really? I seem nervous?

728
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,202
Just a little.

729
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,287
He's here.

730
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:06,966
He's here?

731
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,964
No!No!

732
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,761
Cheng! My God!

733
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:21,921
No!

734
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:25,010
This is Agent Wilson.
Yes, I need an ambulance right now.

735
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,611
- Dupont Circle.
- Max...

736
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,365
<i>Agent Wilson,
I have dispatched the ambulance.</i>

737
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:44,841
You got me. You got me.

738
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:47,003
I'm here. Look at me. Look at me.

739
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:50,130
Zeus.Zeus.

740
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,725
What?

741
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,129
<i><i>Virtual conference initiating.</i>

742
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:07,170
Max? You okay?

743
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,283
They said it was urgent.
What is it?

744
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,041
Yeah. Um...

745
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:15,483
I wanted to apologize.

746
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:16,888
Ap0logize?

747
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,204
If you had any idea
what I just walked away from...

748
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:24,411
You're gonna drag me up here
just to apologize?

749
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,525
<i>All right. Fine.</i>

750
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:28,841
Apﬂlogy accepted.

751
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:31,242
Hey, Max, we don't walk out
on each other.

752
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,805
That's the unspoken code
between brothers.

753
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,441
<i>You remember that day
Dad took us fishing?</i>

754
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:50,646
Yeah, he dropped his cell phone
in Key Biscayne.

755
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,520
Proof the Lawsons aren't fishermen.

756
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,088
<i>Four hours,</i>

757
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,288
the three of us didn't catch a thing.

758
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:06,086
I tried to sabotage Dad's reel
so we could leave.

759
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,683
That pin
at the highest part of the spool,

760
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,930
<i>pulled it so the level mechanism
would pop out.</i>

761
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:18,806
Of course, Dad was a government spy
his whole life, caught me red-handed.

762
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:25,963
"Trust me," he said.
"l get it. No one likes to fail.

763
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:31,160
<i>"But I'd rather not catch fish
with my family</i>

764
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:34,322
<i>"than catch 20 fish alone."</i>

765
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:39,046
I didn't even understand
what he meant back then.

766
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,607
But I do now.

767
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:46,527
<i>Take care, Max.</i>

768
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,330
End transmission.

769
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,802
<i>Transmission ended.</i>

770
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,162
What was all that?

771
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:02,204
That was the first decent conversation
we've had in years.

772
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,924
- Hey.
- on, my God!

773
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,445
Would you relax?

774
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:17,602
What?

775
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,167
Do you have a moment?

776
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,044
Yes! I do. I got your message.

777
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:22,248
Jesus.

778
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,250
What happened?
Did Secret Service Barbie dump you?

779
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,410
I need to show you something.

780
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:30,562
<i>Take a look at this.</i>

781
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:34,600
<i>You remember that day
Dad took us fishing?</i>

782
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,486
<i>He dropped his cell phone
in Key Biscayne.</i>

783
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:44,045
Our dad never took us fishing.

784
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:45,647
Oh.

785
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:47,642
That's sad.

786
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,041
Oh, I'm sorry.

787
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,448
I'm not good at the, like,
"Talk about your daddy issues"

788
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:54,722
kind of friend thing. I just...

789
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,009
What? No, no, no...

790
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,446
It's a code.

791
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:04,407
"He dropped his cell phone
in Key Biscayne."

792
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:06,885
His cell phone number is the key.

793
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:10,526
Take a look at the digits.

794
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:13,531
Okay, you got your first number,
that's your first word.

795
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,888
Second number, nine,
you move on nine words.

796
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:16,928
-That's your second word.
-Mmm-hmm.

797
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:17,968
Third number, nine again.

798
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,965
Another nine, you move on. Then nine,
then two, then nine, then five,

799
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:24,084
and so on and so on until you get
an entirely different message.

800
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,846
Oh. So, who came up
with this encryption, a 12-year-old?

801
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,121
No. I was 13.

802
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,525
Okay.

803
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,967
So, one-nine-nine-nine,

804
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,202
<i>two-nine-five-five,</i>

805
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:41,086
eight-seven-one and go.

806
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:47,043
<i>Proof of sabotage at
the highest level of government.</i>

807
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:48,646
<i>Trust no one.</i>

808
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,565
Well, you said
you were looking for action.

809
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:00,964
Uh, yeah, but I mean, holy shit.

810
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,803
If you don't wanna take this any
further, I totally understand.

811
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:07,242
No. I do, I do. I just...

812
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,725
I do and I don't.

813
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:13,765
Kinda like going on a rollercoaster
or eating Chipotle.

814
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:17,246
What's our next move?

815
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:21,161
Okay. I need you to find anything
you can on a file named "Project Zeus."

816
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:25,367
"Project Zeus"?

817
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:26,562
Yeah.

818
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,481
Okay. Looks like we have ourselves
a bro-spiracy theory.

819
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,284
-Just run the damn search.
-Yeah.

820
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:33,841
Um...

821
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:36,050
I am getting a hit.

822
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,167
Um...

823
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,528
But it looks like it's double encrypted.
It's a little 0CD.

824
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:41,002
Can you break it?

825
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:42,851
Yeah, I could,

826
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:45,890
but I can't do it from here.

827
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:48,804
The file's under a White House security
network, and it's just not hackable.

828
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,804
I'd have to log in,
and I don't have the credentials for it.

829
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,405
Shit. Neither do I.

830
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:55,842
I don't know anyone who does.

831
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:58,966
Yeah, you do.

832
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:10,287
Max?

833
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:24,968
Freeze.

834
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,401
Oh! Holy shit!

835
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,245
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Honey, relax!

836
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,170
Who is this girl in our house?

837
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:32,890
I can explain everything.

838
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:34,485
Mmm, that sounds really pervy.

839
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:36,091
-Shut <i>up.
-Okay, I'm sorry. I will.</i>

840
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:38,971
I broke one of your wine glasses. Um...

841
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,407
ltjust fell and I promise
I'm gonna reimburse you.

842
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,284
I have the money. I'm sorry.

843
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:44,488
Talk.

844
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:47,564
This is Dana.
She works with me in State.

845
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,084
Now, I asked her here
because I need her help,

846
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:53,125
and as it turns out,
I need your help, too.

847
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:55,442
She's hot!

848
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,643
<i>I know how much
your job means to you.</i>

849
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:02,041
I took an oath, Max.

850
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,925
We have rules.

851
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,650
Technically, you're not supposed
to be sleeping together either--

852
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,086
Dana.

853
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:09,163
You're asking me to commit a crime.

854
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:13,885
You're soliciting a Secret Service agent
to break into the White House server

855
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,844
<i>and illegally obtain files.</i>

856
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,809
And you thought I would say yes!

857
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:20,008
-I still think you're gonna say yes.
-Why?

858
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:22,321
Because I'm the one who's asking you.

859
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:24,284
And if I'm asking you,

860
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:26,488
well, then it must be important.

861
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:29,491
And you know that it's bigger
than you and me.

862
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:30,642
"You and l."

863
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:31,841
Shut up.

864
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:38,450
Sarah, please.

865
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,569
One time.

866
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:46,640
We need to play back the security
cameras without alerting anyone.

867
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:48,607
Someone killed Makmoud.

868
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,809
We find out why,
we know who's behind this.

869
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:53,731
But you can't access the cameras
without it being logged in.

870
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,844
That's why we're going to the back-up
server room.

871
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:59,568
You see? It comes in handy
that I built the place.

872
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:04,365
Yes, but I live here.

873
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:13,568
Show off.

874
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:23,008
Makmoud was prepping diagnostics
on the Afghan sat

875
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:24,771
while we launched a replacement.

876
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:30,841
Son of a bitch.

877
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:33,129
He pulled something off the sat.

878
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,046
Poor bastard figured it out,

879
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,964
and they killed him to make sure
no one else did.

880
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:40,729
<i>There are no cameras allowed
in the locker rooms.</i>

881
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:45,129
Then let's go take a look for ourselves.

882
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:56,921
181.

883
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:00,208
181.

884
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:02,608
What's the code?

885
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:05,571
Seven, six, three, six, three.

886
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,246
<i>What do you think
you're doing?</i>

887
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:23,369
You know what happened to me out there
wasn't an accident.

888
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:25,647
<i>Whoever did that</i>

889
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:27,168
killed Makmoud.

890
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:29,322
And what makes you think it is not me?

891
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:32,484
Because if it was you,
I'd be dead already.

892
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:36,446
Dussette, lower your gun.

893
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:40,802
Whatever you're looking for,

894
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,451
it is not in this locker.

895
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:45,806
I was here when Makmoud came in.

896
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:47,605
He put his stuff in an empty one.

897
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,085
Why didn't you tell me?

898
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:52,966
You watched the same
security footage as I did.

899
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:56,244
I was just waiting to see who was
gonna come and look for Makmoud's stuff.

900
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:58,002
It's in here.

901
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:02,841
<i>UTE". Two, six, six, five, three.</i>

902
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:15,122
Bingo.

903
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:19,369
This is everything he copied
off the satellite onto his HoloFrame.

904
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:22,801
<i>That's</i> a <i>virus.</i>

905
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,365
That wasn't generated by the satellite's
on board computer.

906
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:28,125
Because they were planted.

907
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:31,484
Makmoud found the virus and got killed
before he could tell anyone.

908
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:34,163
<i>Oh, I got it-
All right, here we go.</i>

909
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:36,968
Project Zeus.

910
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:41,082
There are tens of thousands of
storm simulations in here,

911
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,169
and each one is starting
in a different place.

912
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:45,129
<i>MAX". They all end the same way.</i>

913
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:46,885
A geostorm.

914
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,481
I mean, unlike anything we've ever seen.

915
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:54,202
Dana, can you show us just the
simulation that begins in Afghanistan?

916
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:55,248
Yeah, sure.

917
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:00,244
<i>Okay, now filter those</i>

918
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:03,011
so that the second malfunction's
over Hong Kong.

919
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:04,485
Where are you going with this?

920
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:08,881
What if Cheng realized that someone
was following one of his scenarios?

921
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,681
You know, making it look like
a predicted pattern of malfunction,

922
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:14,560
disguising a crime
like a series of accidents.

923
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:15,966
It might actually be
a series of accidents.

924
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:18,487
If it were,
they wouldn't have killed him.

925
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:22,040
Someone has weaponized Dutch Boy.

926
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,564
<i><i>Virtual conference initiating.</i>

927
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:27,728
<i>H9)’-</i>

928
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:29,642
New face?

929
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:31,325
Yeah. A friend.

930
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:33,728
Uh, she's keeping things off
the monitor channels,

931
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:34,882
<i>so we're good.</i>

932
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:37,327
- So you got my message?
- Yeah, <i>I</i> got your message-.

933
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:40,691
It's, uh... It's worse than we thought.

934
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:44,522
Whoever's doing this is using
Dutch Boy to target cities.

935
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:47,531
Yeah, they're disguising their moves
as malfunctions.

936
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:49,644
They already killed the man
who found out about this,

937
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,131
and I don't think they're done.

938
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:52,567
Yeah.

939
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,410
This was my life's work, Max.

940
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:58,368
You know, they said it was impossible,

941
01:00:58,600 --> 01:00:59,601
but we pulled it off.

942
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,081
And it worked

943
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:04,369
perfectly, without fail,
day after day, year after year.

944
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:06,170
So what do people do with it?

945
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:09,971
Turn it into a gun.

946
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,122
<i>I know.</i>

947
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,887
<i>I know. It's not too late.
We can fix this</i>

948
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:16,691
before it happens again,
but I can't do it on my own.

949
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,724
I need you. I need you to tell me,
how are they controlling Dutch Boy?

950
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:21,485
- I know how they're controlling it.
- How?

951
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:23,046
A virus.

952
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:24,765
<i>Well, can you stop it?</i>

953
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:25,922
There's only one way.

954
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:28,845
We can shut down Dutch Boy temporarily.

955
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:31,802
The reboot will flush out the system,

956
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:34,531
kill the virus, and revert back
to the fail-safe OS.

957
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:38,370
Okay. Let's do it.

958
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:39,846
I'm authorizing.

959
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:43,249
Yeah, I think we've established
that I don't really wait for that.

960
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:44,408
This isn't a Chromebook.

961
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:46,165
You don't just put your finger
on the power button.

962
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:47,810
You need the kill codes.

963
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:51,926
And the only one who has those
is the president.

964
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:54,327
So let's just go to the president
and tell him what we know.

965
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:56,807
No. You can't go to Palma.

966
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:00,202
<i>We need way more proof than I have.</i>

967
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:01,885
We're talking about shutting down
Dutch Boy.

968
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:04,440
I mean, even for an hour,
that puts the whole planet at risk.

969
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,609
No, I don't think you understand.

970
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,962
Someone sealed off the backdoor
into the system.

971
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:12,329
A backdoor almost no one knew existed.

972
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:14,091
But the president did.

973
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:16,800
No. Jake, come on. What?

974
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,281
Are you out of your mind?

975
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:21,126
Not saying it's him. I'm saying,
"What if?"

976
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:24,324
Who else has the resources
to pull this off?

977
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:29,731
Murder, cover-up, a virus that can only
be stopped with the codes in his pocket.

978
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:32,042
Why? Huh? Tell me, why?
Why would he do that?

979
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:35,966
We're two weeks away from transferring
Dutch Boy to the rest of the world.

980
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:38,691
Two weeks away from losing
autonomous control.

981
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:41,161
Now, he talks a good game,
but he's never gonna let it happen.

982
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:46,042
A series of disasters,
an international crew to take the fall,

983
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:47,401
and he'll have to cancel the hand off.

984
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,330
And who would blame him?

985
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:54,090
All right. You stay on top
of your satellites.

986
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:57,121
Max.

987
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:59,050
Max, don't do anything stupid.

988
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:00,088
Let's go.

989
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:02,249
<i>Okay? They already
tried to kill me once.</i>

990
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:04,845

995

<i>Mr. President, a moment
before you head to Orlando?</i>

996
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,329
My friends
from Washington, D.C.

997
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:27,645
<i>I could never get on a plane without
saying hello to you. It's impossible.</i>

998
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:33,126
What are you doing here?

999
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:37,205
-Are you insane?
-Sarah, look.

1000
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:40,927
Jake needs us to
steal the kill codes from Palma.

1001
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:42,008
Us?

1002
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:45,081
You're asking me to help you
on the word of your asshole brother,

1003
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:46,764
who you haven't even spoken to
for three years.

1004
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:47,602
Yeah.

1005
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:51,765
Think about it. Afghanistan, Hong Kong,
Cheng, the crazy sim shit,

1006
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:53,649
the death on the space station. Come on.

1007
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:57,767
Look, you gotta trust me on this,
all right? I'm not kidding around here.

1008
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:00,850
-Okay.
-Look.

1009
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:04,522
The codes are on Pa|ma's HoloFrame.

1010
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:06,681
We can't do it on the plane.

1011
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:07,568
Why not?

1012
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:09,444
Too many eyes. He's never alone.

1013
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,444
All right, then what's the play?

1014
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:16,968
Palma wants some private time to shower
and make calls before the after-parties.

1015
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:18,361
You follow. I'll get you inside.

1016
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:20,245
I can steal the codes while he's
in the shower.

1017
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:22,329
-That's the idea.
-Yes, it is.

1018
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:27,522

Oh, my God.

1022
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:39,524
We have nearly 200 satellites

Max.

1027
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:16,964
I didn't know you were coming
to the convention.

1028
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:19,766
Yeah. You know,
my dad lives in Florida,

1029
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:21,645
so I promised I'd get him
into the convention.

1030
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:23,520
We need every vote, right?

1031
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:26,645
Yeah, well, bring him to the green room.
We'll do a little photo op.

1032

Oh, that's very kind of you, sir.
Thank you.

-Wait, wait, wait...

1042

into them.

01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:26,807
Four more years! Four more years!

1100
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:29,611
You better be goddamn sure of yourself,
making accusations like that.

1101
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:32,081
With all due respect, we don't have time
to argue about this.

1102
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:34,401
Palma and I go way back.
Why would he do that? That's insane.

1103
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:35,687
Yeah, well, he's doing it.

1104
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:36,847
What's your proof?

1105
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:39,885
Yeah, I got proof.
Dozens of files, all right?

1106
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:42,004
In Project Zeus. It's all there.

1107
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:46,409
Well, we can't get the kill codes
from the president.

1108
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:47,888
Why not?

1109
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:50,527
Because the president is the kill codes.

1110
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:54,129
Biometrics. Ten fingerprints,
two retina scans.

1111
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:56,281
Well, what do we do?

1112
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:00,963
I'll have to reason with him.
We'll have to reason with him.

1113
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:03,208
Satellites are
going critical over Florida.

1114
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:04,765
Load a replacement sat, now.

1115
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:13,523
<i>Station
self-destruct sequence initiated.</i>

1116
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:15,764
<i>Phase one commencing now.</i>

1117
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:18,321
Okay. Shut that down!

1118
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:19,721
I can't. I'm locked out.

1119
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,650
We built in backdoor overrides.

1120
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:22,642
Yeah, I'm trying them.

1121
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:25,522
<i>If we lose the station, we won't be able
to control the satellites.</i>

1122
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:28,521
Self-destruct?

1123
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:31,209
Why would you build that
into the station?

1124
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:33,089
In case it fell to Earth.

1125
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:35,569
Where's Duncan?

1126
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:38,127
He's the one with enough programming
expertise to override the commands.

1127
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:40,961
Duncan.

1128
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:49,002
<i>JAKE". That's the fuel tanks.</i>

1129
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:50,287
They're the first to go.

1130
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:52,761
Then section by section
until command and retrieval.

1131
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,843
Okay, everybody, get to the shuttles!

1132
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:56,770
<i>Evacuate!</i>

1133
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:59,122
Come on, we gotta hurry! Go, go, go!

1134
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,648
Jake, what are you still doing here?

1135
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:08,482
That felt good.

1136
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:10,885
Been wanting to do that
since I first met you.

1137
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:12,246
Have you gone mad?

1138
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:14,448
Yeah, pretty much.

1139
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:16,051
The virus.

1140
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:18,600
You're the only one that could have
put it in the system.

1141
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:21,764
You're the only one who could've
sealed off the backdoor.

1142
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:25,204
The only one that could've helped
to pull this off.

1143
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:31,250
I need the overrides for the
self-destruct to the station, now!

1144
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:32,646
I mean, what for?

1145
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:34,490
I'm not gonna be here when it blows.

1146
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:36,682
But you will.

1147
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:41,126
Come on, man. Why'd you do it?

1148
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:45,331
Well, you know what us
lowly scientists get paid?

1149
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:47,847
Take that times 1,000.

1150
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:49,081
What difference is it gonna make?

1151
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:51,606
If you don't stop, there's not gonna be
a planet to spend it on.

1152
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:54,400
Please. We're gonna keep
all the best bits.

1153
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:58,685
Aren't you a little bit curious
to watch the world burn?

1154
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:02,325
No. 'Cause millions of people
are gonna die.

1155
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,286
And one of them's my daughter.

1156
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:35,722
Oh, shit.

1157
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:48,682
Holding room for the president
down on the left.

1158
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:50,081
We'll confront him there.

1159
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:52,808
Project Zeus.

1160
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:54,966
Did Cheng tell you anything else?

1161
01:13:58,320 --> 01:13:59,207
Cheng?

1162
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:10,727
<i>But this president
knows that hope is not a plan.</i>

1163
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:12,201
<i>This president knows</i>

1164
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:13,971
<i>that despite how far we've come,</i>

1165
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:16,163
<i>there is much more work ahead.</i>

1166
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:19,924
<i>Working to save our planet</i>

1167
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,004
<i>is my first priority as vice president.</i>

1168
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:27,323
<i>This is but a stepping stone
to the success</i>

1169
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:32,165
<i>and greatness that can and will be
the future of our society.</i>

1170
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:33,128
Excuse me.

1171
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:36,091
<i>That's why I'm here tonight with
the Speaker of the House,</i>

1172
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:39,842
<i>the Senate pro tempore,
and President Pa|ma's whole cabinet.</i>

1173
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:42,084
<i>We all stand united in support...</i>

1174
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:43,566
Palma doesn't leave the building.

1175
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:45,160
-Yes, sir.
-Let's go.

1176
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:50,926
Where have you been?

1177
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,570
Come here.

1178
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:54,769
It's not the president, all right?
It's Dekkom.

1179
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,889
Dekkom? How do you know?

1180
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:59,122
Because he just tried to kill me.
That's how I know.

1181
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:02,848
Look, the sim shows Orlando
is the next city to be hit.

1182
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:05,048
Here? Why would he do that?

1183
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:07,044
Because Dekkom wants Palma
trapped here, all right?

1184
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:10,324
And everyone else who's next in line
for the presidency.

1185
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:13,647
Are we still stealing the codes?

1186
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:17,604
The president is the kill codes,
all right? They're biometric.

1187
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:20,008
If Palma dies,
Dutch Boy can't be stopped.

1188
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:22,562
Sure, kidnap the president.
That sounds like the reasonable move.

1189
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:24,324
Yeah, well,
it's the only move we've got.

1190
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:27,288
Unless you wanna steal his fingers
and his eyes.

1191
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:28,447
Huh?

1192
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:35,370
We go now.

1193
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:36,966
You get us a car.

1194
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:39,121
I'll get us a president.

1195
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:40,806
All right, good.

1196
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:42,446
<i>The program did not gain</i>

1197
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:45,569
<i>the immense
international support that it...</i>

1198
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:50,050
Gunman spotted. POTUS is compromised.
Evac to secure location Alpha.

1199
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:52,568
Get him out, get him out!

1200
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:02,406
GO, go:

1201
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,609
Secret Service! Get back! Get back!

1202
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:15,041
You got a 20 on the shooters?

1203
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:17,771
Front mezzanine by exit 212!
Two men with automatics!

1204
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:19,251
- I'm on it! You get POTUS!
- You two,

1205
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:21,050
secure this entrance!
No one comes down this hallway!

1206
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:23,248
Nobody gets through! Hard room, Lammy.

1207
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:24,328
- Got it!
- You two,

1208
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:25,971
clear the emergency exit now!

1209
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:34,647
I'm sorry, Mr. President.

1210
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:36,766
You need to come with me.

1211
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:41,005
<i>This eXil‘ is Off limits!</i>

1212
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:43,046
<i>Please remain calm.</i>

1213
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:47,804
Seriously? A self-driving cab?

1214
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:50,202
Dana jacked it remotely.
It was all I could get.

1215
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:51,561
What the hell's going on here, Lawson?

1216
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:54,087
Please, sir. Look, I'll explain
everything in the car.

1217
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:56,721
Please, sir! We don't have much time!

1218
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:15,487
Keep moving! Get to the shuttles!

1219
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:17,168
Keep going!

1220
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:18,521
Quick!

1221
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:23,486
<i><i>Time to geostorm, 55 minutes.</i>

1222
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:45,684
Sir, I can barely hear you.
The storm is causing too much static.

1223
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:47,450
<i>The Secret Service
will be homing in</i>

1224
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,568
<i>on the beacon

1225
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:51,330
You have got to get to him
before they do.

1226
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:54,524
Under no circumstances can he make it
out of Orlando.

1227
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:57,487
<i>Our man on the space station
did his job.</i>

1228
01:17:57,760 --> 01:17:59,683
-Now you do yours.
-Copy that. Got it.

1229
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:07,721
<i>- Dekkom?
- It's the perfect weapon, sir.</i>

1230
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,367
All right, Dekkom is trying to change
the map of the world.

1231
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:12,124
And what? Blame it on a computer glitch?

1232
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:14,441
Yeah, well, that and a dead president.

1233
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:18,520
He'll take office after wiping out
everyone in the line of succession.

1234
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:30,441
Dear God.

1235
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:52,570
-Get to cover! Under the bridge.
-Sir.

1236
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:37,001
You are implicating
the Secretary of State in this.

1237
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:38,486
Do you realize you're committing--

1238
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:40,483
Treason. Oh, yeah.
I kidnapped the president.

1239
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:44,008
I've stolen state secrets.
Anything I'm forgetting, honey?

1240
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:45,807
Honey?

1241
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:47,367
Guilty.

1242
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:49,409
It took years
for Dekkom to plan this, sir.

1243
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:51,369
A president's schedule
always changes last minute.

1244
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:53,681
This is the one day and date
he could be sure wouldn't move.

1245
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:54,807
Having my brother and I

1246
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:57,042
lead the investigation
was a setup from the start.

1247
01:19:57,320 --> 01:19:58,287
Think about it.

1248
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:00,045
He hired us to fail.

1249
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:02,649
Get down!

1250
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:51,805
All right, it's saying
we're back in the clear,

1251
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:53,041
<i>where the four meets the 91!</i>

1252
01:20:57,320 --> 01:20:58,890
Just gotta take care

1253

1255
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:23,007
Marry her.

1256

No. We're fine here.

Honey, the Orlando storm is getting
really close to your dad's place.

1264
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:25,607
I can't get through to him.
Has he texted you?

1265
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:26,847
He's not there.

1266
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:29,767

- I'm not coming.
- What?

1273
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,562
When my brother gets those kill codes,

1274
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:04,086
someone has to be here
to execute the program.

1275
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:05,525
No. We need to go.

1276
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,011
We haven't heard from him in hours.

1277

ltrust him.

1278
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:11,166
You know the reboot
has to be done manually.

1279
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:12,646
Then I stay. I'm the commander.

1280
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:13,927
No.

1281
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:17,326
I'm the only one my brother
will trust with the codes,

1282
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:19,760
so I need your HoloFrame.

1283
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:27,007
You have to insert it manually
at the core of the mainframe.

1284
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:30,161
You can find it, yes?

1285
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,001
-Yes.
-Good.

1286
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,001

1287

1290
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:00,405
You really wanna drive back into that?

1291
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:04,885
Yeah, right after it passes,
I'll be the sole survivor,

1292
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:08,648
ready to be sworn in as
the next President of the United States.

1293
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:21,251
Here they come.

1294
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:28,882
Fire.

1295
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:58,811
You thought the president was the only
one who could be tracked?

1296
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:09,370
-How in hell did you--
-How?

1297
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:13,329
Because I'm the goddamn President
of the United States of America.

1298
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:15,210
You're done, Leonard.

1299
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:22,367
He's all yours.

1300
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:28,761
Wait, wait! Wait a minute.

1301
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:31,122
I've given you an opportunity,
Mr. President.

1302
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:32,811
You should take it.

1303
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:35,481
An opportunity? Let him go!

1304
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:36,682
It's genocide, Leonard!

1305
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:39,691
You say genocide,
I say preemptive strike.

1306
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:41,126
You've lost your mind!

1307
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:44,131
Tomorrow the sun will rise.
All our enemies will be gone.

1308
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:47,047
Wiped away as if by the hand of God.

1309
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,365
Why would you do this?

1310
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:52,404
Because no one else would.

1311
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:54,603
I'm turning the clock back to 1945,

1312
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:59,164
when America was a shining city on a
hill, not a bank disguised as a country.

1313
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:00,686
By playing God?

1314
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:03,361
What the hell is Dutch Boy
if not playing God?

1315
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:05,285
Ask Max. He knows.

1316
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:07,329
Science is all about playing God.

1317
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:09,847
Sometimes God doesn't play so nice.

1318
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:12,563
Yeah, well,
you know what my brother would say?

1319
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:13,608
What?

1320
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:21,921
Get him outta here!

1321
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:25,287
Let's go, Lawson!

1322
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:29,449
That's my fiancé.

1323
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,408
Get the president to cover! Hurry!

1324

Safe.

1329

1331
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:49,325

01:34:56,360 --> 01:34:57,407
<i>Best seat in the house.</i>

1413
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:08,808
<i>Ute,</i>

1414
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:12,965
<i>do you believe in</i> a <i>Hail</i> Mary?

1415
01:35:15,120 --> 01:35:17,441
<i>Follow me. We gotta get
to the satellite.</i>

1416
01:35:56,840 --> 01:35:58,001
<i>JAKE". I've got you.</i>

1417
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:06,444
<i>We've gotta get away as far as we can
before the final detonation.</i>

1418
01:36:07,960 --> 01:36:08,882
<i><i>Dock releasing.</i>

1419
01:36:48,920 --> 01:36:52,003
<i>And it appears
we have lost the space station.</i>

1420
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:55,449
<i>A tragic ending
for the two heroes still aboard.</i>

1421
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:12,006
<i>Hey, Max, take a look.</i>

1422
01:37:15,320 --> 01:37:17,402
I'm picking up exhaust flares,

1423
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:20,969
<i>and they're pulsing in a Mayday pattern.</i>

1424
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:31,648
See if we can turn
one of the shuttles around.

1425
01:37:41,680 --> 01:37:43,762
<i>JAKE". Hopefully, someone sees this.</i>

1426
01:37:47,680 --> 01:37:49,091
<i>Fingers crossed.</i>

1427
01:38:22,240 --> 01:38:24,322
<i>Hernandez, you son of a bitch!</i>

1428
01:38:25,080 --> 01:38:26,127
<i>Thank the Mexican.</i>

1429
01:38:44,280 --> 01:38:46,681
Yes! Come here. Yes!

1430
01:39:19,160 --> 01:39:20,650
<i>NEWSCASTER". A miracle indeed.</i>

1431
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:24,887
<i>The shuttle you see is bringing home
all the ISS crew members</i>

1432
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,525
<i>who remained on the station.</i>

1433
01:39:41,240 --> 01:39:44,722
Hi, Jake. I'm Sarah, Max's fiancée.

1434
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:46,885
Oh, welcome to the family.

1435
01:39:47,200 --> 01:39:49,328
Well done, well done, both of you.

1436
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:51,970
Sorry I doubted you, Mr. President.

1437
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:54,931
Yeah, well, you were wrong, Jake, again.

1438
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,321
Well, how many times
do I have to tell you?

1439
01:39:57,840 --> 01:39:58,841
Never listen to me.

1440
01:40:07,640 --> 01:40:09,165
God, it's good to have you back, man.

1441
01:40:09,480 --> 01:40:10,641
Good to be back.

1442
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:38,403
It's a nice place
you got here, Jake.

1443
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:40,287
Thank you.

1444
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:43,330
So when you heading back up?

1445
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:45,760
-In a week.
-Yeah?

1446
01:40:46,360 --> 01:40:47,850
Yeah, a lot of work left.

1447
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,604
But I'll be back.

1448
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:53,561
I know.

1449
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:05,529
-This sucks.
-Yeah, seriously, this is so boring.

1450
01:41:05,640 --> 01:41:07,642
You know what?
I can't do this for another second.

1451
01:41:08,280 --> 01:41:09,566
Now, Why'd you make us do this
in the first place?

1452
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:11,564
I don't know.
I was trying to relive a moment.

1453
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:13,404
A moment? What moment?

1454
01:41:13,640 --> 01:41:16,450
We never went fishing with Dad.
You made that whole story up.

1455
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:18,290
Yeah, but that was a good story,
though,huh?

1456
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:19,880
I mean, you gotta give me that.

1457
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:21,764
I mean, it had a moral and everything.

1458
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:23,763
Moral? What moral?

1459
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,445
<i>HANNAH". You can't undo the past.</i>

1460
01:41:29,720 --> 01:41:31,643
<i>All you can do is face what's ahead.</i>

1461
01:41:32,520 --> 01:41:35,729
<i>NASA maintained the satellites
while we rebuilt the space station.</i>

1462
01:41:36,520 --> 01:41:41,048
<i>We made it safer, made it stronger.
It belongs to all of us now.</i>

1463
01:41:41,640 --> 01:41:43,563
<i>One planet, one people.</i>

1464
01:41:44,600 --> 01:41:49,561
<i>And as long as we remember that
we share one future, we will survive.</i>
