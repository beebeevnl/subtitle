1
0:0:0.271 --> 0:0:2.340
I wanna make a good
impression, so what?

2
0:0:2.374 --> 0:0:4.710
Oh, yeah, Jamal,
are you free to dogsit JB

3
0:0:4.744 --> 0:0:6.079
tomorrow night
while we're there?

4
0:0:6.111 --> 0:0:8.481
Ah, sorry, bruv, I've got
to look after my nan tomorrow.

5
0:0:8.514 --> 0:0:9.716
But Liam's free, though.

6
0:0:9.749 --> 0:0:10.850
EGGSY: Oh, yeah?

7
0:0:10.882 --> 0:0:13.018
I can't, mate.
I'm allergic to dogs.

8
0:0:13.052 --> 0:0:13.953
Bullshit.

9
0:0:13.986 --> 0:0:15.287
Dogshit, actually.

10
0:0:15.321 --> 0:0:16.456
(laughing)

11
0:0:16.488 --> 0:0:18.257
That leaves you, Brandon.
What you doing tomorrow night?

12
0:0:18.290 --> 0:0:19.858
Yeah, I'll look after
your dog, mate,

13
0:0:19.891 --> 0:0:21.460
but I got one condition.

14
0:0:21.494 --> 0:0:22.595
What's that?

15
0:0:22.629 --> 0:0:24.230
You have a drink with us.
Yeah.

16
0:0:24.264 --> 0:0:25.465
Got to do it, babe.

17
0:0:25.497 --> 0:0:26.631
Got to do it.
(EXCLAIMS)

18
0:0:26.664 --> 0:0:28.200
Brandon, happy birthday!

19
0:0:28.768 --> 0:0:30.136
ALL: Happy birthday.

20
0:0:30.169 --> 0:0:31.471
JAMAL: Yeah.
EGGSY: Cheers.

21
0:0:32.203 --> 0:0:33.205
Shit.

22
0:0:36.040 --> 0:0:39.011
POPPY:
My drugs are everywhere.

23
0:0:40.913 --> 0:0:42.615
They were never my thing...

24
0:0:42.649 --> 0:0:43.883
but here I am,

25
0:0:43.915 --> 0:0:48.020
running the biggest
drug cartel in the world.

26
0:0:48.054 --> 0:0:52.525
The only downside is having to
live in the middle of nowhere.

27
0:0:54.927 --> 0:0:58.531
You know, these ruins
are technically undiscovered.

28
0:0:58.563 --> 0:1:1.834
I just added a few touches
to remind me of home.

29
0:1:3.034 --> 0:1:7.072
I grew up on all that
awesome 50s nostalgia.

30
0:1:7.106 --> 0:1:10.543
Grease. American Graffiti.
Happy Days.

31
0:1:11.810 --> 0:1:13.278
But I digress.

32
0:1:13.313 --> 0:1:15.181
The thing you need to understand

33
0:1:15.213 --> 0:1:17.282
is the hard work
and ingenuity...

34
0:1:17.315 --> 0:1:20.652
it took to achieve
a global monopoly...

35
0:1:20.685 --> 0:1:23.053
on the drug trade.

36
0:1:23.088 --> 0:1:26.224
And that's all on me.
Not to toot my own horn...

37
0:1:26.257 --> 0:1:27.759
I just think
it's really important

38
0:1:27.794 --> 0:1:29.662
for new recruits
to understand...

39
0:1:29.694 --> 0:1:32.598
the history
of The Golden Circle.

40
0:1:37.068 --> 0:1:40.839
So. Lifelong friends, huh?

41
0:1:40.872 --> 0:1:42.775
Charles, do you think
your buddy here

42
0:1:42.808 --> 0:1:44.309
is worthy of joining us?

43
0:1:44.342 --> 0:1:45.910
Ms. Poppy, I would
not have brought him

44
0:1:45.944 --> 0:1:47.545
all the way to see you
if I didn't think so.

45
0:1:47.579 --> 0:1:49.514
Excellent.
Well, you hungry?

46
0:1:49.549 --> 0:1:50.716
Starving.

47
0:1:50.750 --> 0:1:53.119
Wonderful! Right this way.

48
0:1:53.151 --> 0:1:54.953
Make yourselves at home.

49
0:1:56.322 --> 0:1:58.356
So, fellas...

50
0:1:58.390 --> 0:2:2.227
I have a couple of things
that I wanna clarify.

51
0:2:3.395 --> 0:2:5.497
You understand that
in The Golden Circle...

52
0:2:5.530 --> 0:2:9.001
my authority is never
to be questioned, right?

53
0:2:9.034 --> 0:2:10.803
And the importance
of following orders?

54
0:2:10.836 --> 0:2:12.971
Do you understand that?

55
0:2:13.005 --> 0:2:15.073
And the value of loyalty?

56
0:2:16.007 --> 0:2:18.076
It's easy to nod, isn't it?

57
0:2:20.779 --> 0:2:23.482
I don't like easy.
I like proof.

58
0:2:25.583 --> 0:2:27.119
(SIGHS)

59
0:2:28.387 --> 0:2:31.289
What's your name?
Angel, ma'am.

60
0:2:31.323 --> 0:2:32.824
Angel, baby.

61
0:2:32.858 --> 0:2:33.958
Hey.

62
0:2:33.991 --> 0:2:36.261
Your old pal, Charles,
has messed up.

63
0:2:36.294 --> 0:2:37.697
That's all I'm gonna tell you,

64
0:2:37.730 --> 0:2:38.864
'cause that's all
you need to know.

65
0:2:38.896 --> 0:2:40.400
So put him in the mincer, okay?

66
0:2:43.236 --> 0:2:45.004
(LAUGHING)

67
0:2:52.877 --> 0:2:54.513
(WHIRRING)
