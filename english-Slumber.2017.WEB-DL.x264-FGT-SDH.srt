Yes I did, and he's asleep.

335
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,910
he says that he's punching the
walls while he's sleep walking...

336
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:01,420
which is enough to give

Mitchell case?

I don't think so.
What was his first name?

340
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:17,030
Dan Mitchell. He was a farmer
over in Winnetka County.

341
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:20,000
- No.
- Popular guy by all accounts...

342
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,270
went to church every Sunday.

343

Not a bad word to be said
about him.

344
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:28,880
Anyway, this guy was a chicken
farmer with a few dozen coops.

345
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,250
His family and friends
knew him...

346
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:34,250
as a sleepwalker and a sleep
worker.

347
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,550
Every night he used to go out...

348
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,320
and do his farm chores while
he slept.

349
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,960
Fill the feeders, sweep the
floor, clean out the muck.

350
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,430
Every night like clockwork.

351

It sounds pretty useful.

352

Yeah, maybe to begin with.

353

Turns out, the whole family had
a history of parasomnia.

354
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:59,240
One night, while he was seeing
to the chickens in his sleep...

355
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:04,120
he thought there was an intruder
in his house.

356
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,080
He got into a fight with the
attacker...

357
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:08,060
trying to defend his daughter.

358
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:14,160
By the time they woke him,
it was too late.

359
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:18,030
He'd hacked his wife to death
with a shovel.

360

- That's terrible.
- [MALCOLM] Yeah.

361
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,400
And he was really asleep
when he did it?

362
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:26,210
Well, he passed all the lie
detector tests.

363

Even his daughter backed up
the story.

to come again.
