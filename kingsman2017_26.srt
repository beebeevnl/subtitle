1
0:0:9.792 --> 0:0:13.029
What have you done to me,
you fucking bitch?

2
0:0:14.930 --> 0:0:16.664
(SIGHS)
100% effective...

3
0:0:16.698 --> 0:0:18.434
and ready to ship out worldwide

4
0:0:18.466 --> 0:0:20.068
at a moment's notice.

5
0:0:20.101 --> 0:0:22.304
Get out of my room!
You have my word.

6
0:0:22.337 --> 0:0:24.006
Get out!
I will do this...

7
0:0:24.038 --> 0:0:27.608
if the following
conditions are met.

8
0:0:27.642 --> 0:0:30.313
Get out of my fucking room!

9
0:0:31.547 --> 0:0:34.383
First, you agree
to end the war on drugs,

10
0:0:34.417 --> 0:0:35.816
once and for all.

11
0:0:35.850 --> 0:0:38.554
All classes of substance
are legalized...

12
0:0:38.587 --> 0:0:40.556
paving the way
to a new marketplace

13
0:0:40.588 --> 0:0:43.658
in which sales
are regulated and taxed...

14
0:0:43.691 --> 0:0:45.092
as per alcohol.

15
0:0:45.127 --> 0:0:50.432
And second, my colleagues and
I receive full legal immunity.

16
0:0:50.465 --> 0:0:51.600
Meet my terms...

17
0:0:51.632 --> 0:0:52.767
and I look forward
to helping you

18
0:0:52.801 --> 0:0:54.903
keep our beloved
country great...

19
0:0:54.935 --> 0:0:56.270
boosting our ailing economy,

20
0:0:56.305 --> 0:0:59.441
and easing spending
on law enforcement.

21
0:0:59.475 --> 0:1:1.811
Or continue this
blinkered, outmoded...

22
0:1:1.843 --> 0:1:5.780
and, frankly, disastrous
exercise in prohibition...

23
0:1:5.814 --> 0:1:8.084
and live with blood
on your hands.

24
0:1:9.150 --> 0:1:11.686
Save lives. Legalize.

25
0:1:17.225 --> 0:1:20.028
I told you that shit
was no good for you.

26
0:1:28.904 --> 0:1:30.706
REPORTER: Who is Poppy Adams?

27
0:1:30.739 --> 0:1:32.475
After graduating
Harvard Business School...

28
0:1:32.507 --> 0:1:33.841
Adams was briefly held

29
0:1:33.876 --> 0:1:35.744
for serious mental
health issues...

30
0:1:35.776 --> 0:1:37.813
before disappearing
without a trace.

31
0:1:37.846 --> 0:1:40.515
Intelligent, ambitious,
ruthless,

32
0:1:40.548 --> 0:1:44.051
lacks empathy,
superficial charm.

33
0:1:44.086 --> 0:1:47.689
All the elements of a great CEO.

34
0:1:47.721 --> 0:1:50.158
Or a psychopath.

35
0:1:50.191 --> 0:1:51.193
Following the broadcast

36
0:1:51.226 --> 0:1:52.794
of Adams's message
to the president...

37
0:1:52.828 --> 0:1:54.997
there were scenes
of chaos today...

38
0:1:55.029 --> 0:1:57.632
at medical centers
across the country and around the world.

39
0:1:57.666 --> 0:1:58.967
DOCTOR: We have
no more beds available.

40
0:1:59.001 --> 0:2:2.070
The hospital is
at full capacity.

41
0:2:2.104 --> 0:2:3.672
The blue rash
is now being renamed.

42
0:2:3.706 --> 0:2:4.972
"The Dancing Disease"...

43
0:2:5.006 --> 0:2:8.410
as victims begin to exhibit
stage two symptoms.

44
0:2:14.249 --> 0:2:15.984
Let's prep the cryo unit.

45
0:2:16.017 --> 0:2:17.319
MERLIN:
You want to freeze him?

46
0:2:17.351 --> 0:2:18.720
GINGER: Exactly.

47
0:2:18.753 --> 0:2:19.954
REPORTER: Victims of the virus

48
0:2:19.989 --> 0:2:22.524
caused by contaminated
recreational drugs...

49
0:2:22.557 --> 0:2:26.494
flooded hospitals and clinics
in fear for their lives.

50
0:2:26.528 --> 0:2:28.030
(CLAMORING)

51
0:2:29.597 --> 0:2:31.033
REPORTER 2:
Curfews and no travel orders

52
0:2:31.065 --> 0:2:33.034
are being considered
as authorities assess

53
0:2:33.068 --> 0:2:34.770
the scale of the disaster.

54
0:2:35.169 --> 0:2:36.838
Close it.

55
0:2:38.239 --> 0:2:39.740
REPORTER 2:
But there has still been

56
0:2:39.774 --> 0:2:41.776
no official response
from the president...

57
0:2:41.810 --> 0:2:44.847
who remains locked
in emergency talks.

58
0:2:46.581 --> 0:2:49.217
Prepare a presidential decree.

59
0:2:49.251 --> 0:2:51.586
Tell intelligence and law enforcement
to stand down.

60
0:2:51.619 --> 0:2:53.721
We're gonna dance
to this lady's tune.

61
0:2:53.756 --> 0:2:54.856
FOX: Good.

62
0:2:54.890 --> 0:2:57.025
We can make this work.

63
0:2:57.059 --> 0:2:58.459
We spin it
that it's not a matter

64
0:2:58.493 --> 0:2:59.794
of negotiation with terrorists.

65
0:2:59.828 --> 0:3:1.797
No, what I'm proposing...
