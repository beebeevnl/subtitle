1
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,610
Help!

2
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,720
Hey!

3
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,210
Every 23rd year, for 23 days,

4
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:14,850
it gets to eat.

5
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,080
And the things it leaves behind,

6
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,040
like the thing it left in
Poho County that night,

7
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,620
the nightmare on four wheels,

8
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,220
was a horror all its own.

9
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:36,970
Oh.

10
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,000
Go get the sergeant.

11
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,810
Sergeant!

12
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:47,810
Sergeant!

13
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,080
We got the truck open.

14
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:12,870
God.

15
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,610
God-damn slaughterhouse
on wheels.

16
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,580
Police scanner.

17
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,420
It's been listening to us.

18
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,190
Whatever it is.

19
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:30,760
Some of this stuff,

20
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,560
I don't wanna know what it's made of.

21
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,700
Where the hell is that tow truck?

22
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,800
100.

23
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,300
Coroner's still down in the jail.

24
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,340
Should I get him up here?

25
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,940
Those are for sawing.

26
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,260
I don't wanna know for what.

27
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,770
Get that god-damn
thing in the impound!

28
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,310
Oh my god.

29
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,850
I don't believe it.

30
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,720
Jesus Christ, where
the hell have you been?

31
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,450
How many did you lose tonight?

32
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:36,990
You hold it together
and you answer me.

33
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:41,430
Three officers, an
inmate down in the jail.

34
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:43,060
And then the kid.

35
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,370
The one he flew off with.

36
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,670
Name of Jerry.

37
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,440
His name was Jerry Jenner,
his sister's a train-wreck.

38
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,150
She's inside waiting
for her folks that are

39
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,210
driving in from Stillwater.

40
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,850
Where is the last place you saw it?

41
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:41,060
Don't touch that, and stay back!

42
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:54,410
Show me.

43
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,580
We threw everything
we had at it, Danny.

44
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:08,660
All the fire and manpower
this building had to offer.

45
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,330
And it just made a whole lot of noise

46
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,590
and flew off with
exactly what it wanted.

47
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:17,430
Sheriff, don't you want
us towing that truck?

48
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,000
They just towed it out of here.

49
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,240
Oh, no, no, no!

50
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,670
Can't raise them, they're
not answering any frequency.

51
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,850
- Where are they taking it?
- To impound, where else?

52
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,800
Jesus Christ, we couldn't
leave it sitting there!

53
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,880
You saw what it did.

54
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:31,820
We gotta get an
armada round that thing.

55
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:32,850
You make it happen, now!

56
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:36,220
Anybody, everybody, get
on out there, move fast!

57
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,250
Just a god-damn minute, Danny.

58
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,490
You tell me how the hell
you know about any of this.

59
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:45,210
Because what happened
here happened before!

60
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,910
You think that thing
torched that church tonight

61
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,160
because it wanted a camp fire?

62
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:50,070
It was destroying information,

63
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:52,400
trying to get rid of what
it doesn't want us to know.

64
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,370
And that truck?

65
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,670
That truck is that
thing's rolling history.

66
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,070
Which is why we get it in
the impound and tear it apart.

67
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,340
It ain't gonna make
it to the impound!

68
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:10,620
Looks like rig up, old Chevy Cabo.

69
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,860
Cabo engine, I'd say 1940s.

70
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,700
That cow-catcher's
gotta be custom.

71
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,680
You wanna tell me what
the hell a truck like that

72
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,700
needs a cow-catcher for?

73
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,900
If you knew what was inside that thing,

74
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:29,810
that wouldn't be your only question.

75
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,380
Code three, you read me?

76
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,420
- Code three!
- Come again, sergeant?

77
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,250
Just tell
that driver to put his foot

78
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:43,260
on the gas, we're trying like hell...

79
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,840
What the hell?

80
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:07,380
- What is that?
- Jesus Christ!

81
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,580
Holy shit!

82
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,030
Fear has a scent.

83
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:59,300
You can't have seen
that thing and hate it.

84
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:04,340
Like it could sample fear
right out of the air.

85
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:07,880
Dispatch, this is Lang
with the impound vehicle.

86
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:08,980
Please respond.

87
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:13,020
That's how it picks
what parts of us to eat.

88
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,790
Captain, are you in range?

89
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:16,450
- And it eats...
- This is Dana.

90
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:18,250
We have a situation with
the impound vehicle.

91
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,590
To rebuild itself.

92
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,800
You hear that?

93
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,540
It's coming back.

94
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:57,530
What the...

95
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,780
Stop!

96
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,880
Stop!

97
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:43,650
Stop!

98
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:44,910
Frank!

99
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,580
It never hunts in the same place,

100
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,390
for more than a day.

101
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:53,260
It's done with Poho County.

102
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,060
All we can do now is head north,

103
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,100
and follow the birds.

104
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,470
It's not much, but it's all we know.

105
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:10,440
Ravens and crows, they
travel when it does.

106
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,510
Davis, I've looked that
ugly thing eye to eye.

107
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,690
23 years ago.

108
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:25,830
I know it.

109
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,190
And it knows me.

110
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,580
Why do you do this?

111
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:53,780
It hurts too much seeing you like this.

112
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,220
Mom, just listen, okay?

113
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:01,020
Time's up, it's coming
back just like I said.

114
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:02,430
Why?

115
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:03,790
Stop asking, it doesn't matter.

116
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,900
You.

117
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:07,700
Tell me why it's coming here.

118
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,570
Pieces of it left behind.

119
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:12,240
They're full of secrets about it.

120
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:15,440
That's what's buried up here?

121
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,180
- A piece of it?
- There's no more time.

122
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,740
It's coming here and you
can't be here when it does.

123
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:23,110
- How do you know it's coming?
- I'm a part of it now!

124
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,250
How many times do I
have to tell you that?

125
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,460
It knows what's buried here,

126
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,990
and it will come and take it back.

127
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:29,860
Oh, killing you wasn't enough?

128
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,060
Why didn't it take it 23 years ago?

129
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,530
It ran out of time!

130
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,600
It always runs out of time,
I can't keep telling you this.

131
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:40,630
If you won't leave to save yourself,

132
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:42,670
then do it to save Addison.

133
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,400
Addison?

134
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,940
Addison!

135
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,750
You think that we have any money?

136
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:56,930
Kenny, are you listening to yourself?

137
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,820
Are you list.

138
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,060
Just pack up and go?

139
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:05,360
Pack up everything,
just leave for where?

140
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,690
He knows it's here, Mom,
'cause I'm a part of it,

141
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,860
and it's a part of me.

142
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,730
Today, tomorrow or sometime soon,

143
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,600
it is gonna walk up this
hill and it is gonna

144
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:16,240
dig this thing up right
where I'm standing.

145
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:21,080
And when it comes, it'll kill
anyone that's still here.

146
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,220
Go away, Mom.

147
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,880
Now.

148
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,920
Good morning, handsome.

149
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,490
Hey, you hungry, buddy?

150
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:13,330
Damn.

151
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,540
Come on.

152
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,310
Gotta go talk to Grandma, and
I don't wanna do it alone.

153
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,300
Grandma?

154
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,270
Are you okay?

155
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,080
I'm taking the truck into town.

156
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,020
We need hay.

157
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,560
Who is gonna pay for it?

158
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:13,630
I was thinking maybe we
still had some credit at Hooks?

159
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,200
He called again.

160
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,630
We owe them more than we can pay.

161
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,840
- Cal did say that he...
- Grandma, no.

162
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,740
- Addie.
- I already told you.

163
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,240
I'm not selling Rocket, Grandma.

164
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,550
Selling him would be like
giving away my own child.

165
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,210
What a good mother
might have to do

166
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,820
so that child wouldn't go hungry.

167
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,360
I want you to go
away for a few days.

168
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,130
Maybe stay with Gracie.

169
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:46,000
Why?

170
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,130
Can you?

171
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,870
Is there something that
you don't want me here for?

172
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:55,970
Yes.

173
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,510
I'm expecting company.

174
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,990
You've got your team.

175
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:15,830
You've got experienced
men who know this thing.

176
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,540
Boss.

177
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,470
Michael.

178
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,550
This his old man's truck?

179
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,910
It's an old Vulcan cannon.

180
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:07,820
She's amped up to shoot 20mm
rounds, 6,000 rounds a minute.

181
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,550
You test this thing?

182
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:12,950
Mikey.

183
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,690
Is this thing tested?

184
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:18,530
This thing throws up a wall of fire.

185
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:20,390
A wall of fire that
nothing from this world

186
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,730
or the next can get through!

187
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:26,670
Not without being torn
into a million pieces.

188
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:33,910
She may not fly, but this
is our killing machine.

189
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:42,850
Davis!

190
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,390
He watched that thing fly down,

191
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,760
and punch a hole in his old man.

192
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:51,890
He stood there and
watched it pull the heart

193
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,360
right out of his daddy's chest,

194
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:56,600
and swallowed it
right before his eyes.

195
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,140
Miller was only 10 years old.

196
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:05,510
You're not losing your mind, Davis.

197
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:08,350
You just got bloodied last night.

198
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:17,420
Now do you wanna guess how
much blood I got on my hands?

199
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:20,360
You've seen that thing now.

200
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:23,800
So you got blood
on your hands, too.

201
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:28,100
And no matter what you
do, it's gonna stay there.

202
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,900
Whether you walk away,

203
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,200
or not.

204
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:39,180
Rendezvous on station one!

205
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,050
North!

206
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:48,150
Can I beg some hay off you?

207
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,320
Sure, stranger.

208
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:51,690
Our horses are up in Bolander.

209
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,860
You're not up there with
Rocket winning trophies?

210
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,700
I can't even afford the gas
to drive up there right now.

211
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,470
What's the matter?

212
00:21:58,570 --> 00:21:59,570
Your grandma?

213
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:02,310
Yeah, she was up on the
hill again this morning.

214
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,600
Screaming at the wind?

215
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:05,070
Calling it Kenny?

216
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:07,540
Didn't he die like 20 years ago?

217
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,880
Mom!

218
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,590
You know you got a
rabbit in that trap?

219
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:18,770
That's what it's there for.

220
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:22,490
So it's suffering, are you
just gonna leave it in there?

221
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:23,590
Mom!

222
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,600
Mom, he's got a rabbit in the trap.

223
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:29,330
Hey, Addie, long time no see.

224
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,300
Mom said they were
eating up her garden.

225
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,200
I didn't say you should trap them.

226
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,540
- You didn't say I shouldn't.
- How's your grandma doin'?

227
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:36,850
He doesn't care
about the garden.

228
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:40,710
He traps them because he
likes killing them, he's sick.

229
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,680
I mean, who likes to trap
and kill things for fun, huh?

230
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,610
Psychos, maybe?

231
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,240
He's too stupid to
even know he is one.

232
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:49,000
Alright, stop, and you take
care of this before you leave,

233
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,990
by which I mean let it go.

234
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,720
It's not in any pain.

235
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,620
Don't leave it in the
trap, it's cruel, honey.

236
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,260
Stop!

237
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:01,370
It's a rabbit, Mom.

238
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:03,010
Do you know how small
their brains are?

239
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,800
- 10 times bigger than yours?
- Well, then you let it out.

240
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:07,040
And I hope it bites you.

241
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:10,210
It's a wild animal, idiot,
it's kill or be killed.

242
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:13,510
Just let it go
and stop trapping them, okay?

243
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:15,880
You're all a bunch of women.

244
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,450
Kirk.

245
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,620
Get back here.

246
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:25,120
Tell them about the law of
the jungle, will ya, Addie?

247
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:28,690
Kirk, get out of the car and let it go.

248
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:36,870
- What's out in the hay barn?
- Dad took what we had.

249
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:40,310
That's okay, I'm on
my way to Hooks anyway.

250
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:41,510
Oh, are you?

251
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:43,740
Yes, and shut up.

252
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:46,680
Buddy Hooks has a huge
crush on Addie, Mom.

253
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,610
But neither one of
them are brave enough

254
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,550
to do anything about it.

255
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:53,820
You wouldn't wanna come
with me to Hooks, would you?

256
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,490
And get in the way?

257
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,090
Do you like him or not?

258
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:05,800
He does have a really cute butt.

259
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,270
And from that springs love!

260
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,120
Idiot.

261
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,810
What the hell is that?

262
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:09,270
Somebody just ditched it out here?

263
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:10,670
Hell, I would.

264
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,400
What do you think's in it?

265
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:17,340
Other than cow shit,
what do you think's in it?

266
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,880
- No way.
- Oh, hell no.

267
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:28,890
- No way what?
- Look at that license plate.

268
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:31,260
Beating you?

269
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,160
Be eating you, and no way.

270
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,490
Right.

271
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,760
No way, that story's bullshit.

272
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,030
No, no, I
heard it really happened.

273
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,430
Yeah, I did, too.

274
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,600
- Real people disappeared.
- 20 years ago.

275
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,740
23 and it's just a story.

276
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,840
What story?

277
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:50,380
The guy who drove
around and ate people.

278
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,410
In a scary-ass old truck
with that license plate.

279
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,980
Jeepers Creepers.

280
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,690
What?

281
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:04,930
Wasn't that the song the
guy sang or somethin'?

282
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,290
Look, it's homemade.

283
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,960
At least one idiot
every Halloween

284
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,170
makes a license
plate that says that.

285
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,130
You think it just drove in?

286
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,070
The tracks look fresh.

287
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,810
Do you think somebody
could be in there?

288
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:21,910
Man.

289
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,180
It's warm.

290
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,140
Of course it's warm, you dip-shit.

291
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,450
It's been sitting out in the sun.

292
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:28,950
Who'd dump it out here?

293
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,250
Who wouldn't?

294
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:37,230
Hello!

295
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,070
I can't see shit.

296
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,840
What say we beat it
in case they come back?

297
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:48,810
Anybody in there?

298
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:55,950
Hey, hello in there!

299
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,120
What the is wrong with you, man?

300
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,220
What?

301
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:01,830
- I was just knockin'!
- Well, don't.

302
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:02,850
Idiot.

303
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:11,300
Man, I say we get the hell outta here.

304
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,400
Wait.

305
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:14,270
Break the windows first?

306
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:15,830
Hell yes, we do!

307
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:19,000
We gotta kill Frankenstein's truck, right?

308
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,970
Dibs on the windshield.

309
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,140
Kiss my ass, you ugly old bitch!

310
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,590
Did you see that?

311
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,320
That thing tried to kill
me, nicked my ear.

312
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,090
Maybe it tries to kill things

313
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,460
more stupid than it.

314
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,610
What the hell?

315
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,180
Those can't be real.

316
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:05,050
Those flies are real.

317
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,790
That smell is real.

318
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,530
You gonna be driving
up to see us?

319
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,660
Go Wheaton Valley.

320
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Right?

321
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:22,700
So, 10 bales of Alfalfa?

322
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:26,770
Right.

323
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:35,480
No grandma today, huh?

324
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,950
How's she doin'?

325
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,160
Um...

326
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:48,560
You're not on the load list.

327
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:51,770
Oh-oh.

328
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,340
Do you wanna talk to my dad?

329
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,680
Do you want me to?

330
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,950
I should put her on my load list.

331
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:11,190
You know why she lives
with her grandma, right?

332
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:12,950
Addie couldn't get
along with her stepdad,

333
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,260
so instead of kicking him
out, her mom ships her ass

334
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,920
out here to live with
her crazy grandma.

335
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,730
Can you really blame me
though, I mean, look at her.

336
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,110
I'm just gonna go
to Carlan's and see if we have

337
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:25,130
some credit on there.

338
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,400
Hey, just wait a minute.

339
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,080
What happened?

340
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:38,630
Bernardy's, load it up
and get it out there now.

341
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:39,980
He' waiting for it.

342
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:43,190
What are you doing?

343
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:45,770
She loves that horse more
than anything in the world,

344
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,270
and right now it's
got nothing to eat.

345
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:48,890
'Cause they're broke!

346
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:51,010
You think we're ever gonna see
the money that they owe us?

347
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,770
The state's not even
sending them checks anymore.

348
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,830
And how do you know that?

349
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:57,300
Biggs down at the post
office, how do you think?

350
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,100
Make your point, Dad.

351
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,170
You can do better.

352
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:04,370
That's my point.

353
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,860
Got some hay for you!

354
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:20,830
Turn that thing around!

355
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,460
Let's get your horse some breakfast!

356
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:27,030
What's the problem?

357
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:30,440
I thought you said you
had a hungry horse!

358
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:33,810
Get it out!

359
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,480
We gotta call someone!

360
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,720
Just get it the hell out!

361
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:45,860
What do you want us to do?

362
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,070
Alright look, it's long
enough, I can pull it out.

363
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:48,120
Do you want me to pull it out?

364
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:49,660
Just call someone!

365
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:51,250
There's no service out here!

366
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:54,030
So shut up about the
god-damn phone, alright?

367
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:56,400
- Kirk, look at me.
- Just do something!

368
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,500
Like what?

369
00:31:57,970 --> 00:31:59,870
What the f... do you want us to do?

370
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:02,670
You want us to try and pull it out?

371
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:06,340
Alright, hold him up!

372
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:11,010
Oh, shit.

373
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,750
Okay, on three, are you ready?

374
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,220
Hold him steady, come on!

375
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:24,190
On three I'm gonna pull
like a son of a bitch.

376
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,460
You guys ready?

377
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,400
One!

378
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Two!

379
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:45,450
Oh, shit.

380
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,120
No!

381
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:49,350
What the f...?

382
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:51,290
No, help, help!

383
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:52,390
Oh, shit.

384
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,560
Help!

385
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,360
No!

386
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,460
Help, help!

387
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,130
Red!

388
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:59,230
Red!

389
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,200
Red!

390
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:02,670
Red!

391
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:09,740
Help!

392
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:13,250
Come on, come on!

393
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:14,710
No!

394
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:15,820
Help, no!

395
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:17,150
No!

396
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,780
No!

397
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:20,890
Help!

398
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:24,490
- Don't leave me.
- I'm not!

399
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:25,820
I don't know what to do.

400
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:27,090
Maybe we could cut the cable.

401
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:27,960
With what?

402
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,830
Try the phone again!

403
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:32,270
Come on!

404
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:43,940
So this is the famous Rocket, huh?

405
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,810
He's a beauty.

406
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,810
You understand what
I'm saying, don't you?

407
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:50,410
Every word you say.

408
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,620
Yeah?

409
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,550
Well in that case,

410
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:57,360
do you think Addie here
would ever be interested in

411
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,790
say, a guy like me?

412
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:18,080
In the city, my mother and I had a cat.

413
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,550
Addie.

414
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,480
I liked the cat.

415
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:26,850
It crapped in her boyfriend's shoes,

416
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:28,620
every chance it got.

417
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:32,430
What happened to the boyfriend?

418
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,530
She married him.

419
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:40,330
Then got rid of the cat.

420
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:46,940
Look, I'm not great at this.

421
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:51,710
And when I get nervous,
I start talking too much.

422
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,820
I, uh...

423
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:17,370
Is that your grandmother?

424
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:31,650
Thank you for the
hay, but please just go.

425
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:34,390
Okay.

426
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,060
You wouldn't wanna come?

427
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,980
I mean, I gotta get the rest
of this stuff up to Bernardy's.

428
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,640
Have you ever been up there?

429
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,310
It's really something.

430
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:51,780
I mean, only if you want to.

431
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,940
I'd love to.

432
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,680
Okay.

433
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:13,460
What are you doing?

434
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,100
I need to know what you found.

435
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:16,840
Mom, what are you doing?

436
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,800
And why it killed you for it!

437
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:20,920
No you don't, you don't
wanna see what it'll show you.

438
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:21,940
Go!

439
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:23,010
Away!

440
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,080
Go!

441
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,080
Hey!

442
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,290
Stop!

443
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,560
Hey, stop!

444
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:49,100
No!

445
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:55,710
Come on, Gaylen, are you out there?

446
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:58,940
I got a lot of units
headed out to station one.

447
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,150
What is that, a roll bar?

448
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,880
Did you reinforce this thing?

449
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:09,290
First time I met Gaylen was 23 years ago.

450
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,660
On the worst night of her life.

451
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:17,600
Her son Kenny and his
date, Darla Cleeway,

452
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:20,900
disappeared on their
way to the prom.

453
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,770
All they found was a wrecked
pickup and no bodies.

454
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:28,840
When Gaylen finally believed
what happened to Kenny,

455
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:31,780
she asked if she
could join the team.

456
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:35,380
That was the beginning for me.

457
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:37,480
Like last night,

458
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,690
was the beginning for you.

459
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:01,440
Where is everybody?

460
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:17,420
Buddy.

461
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,260
Buddy.

462
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,040
Hurry.

463
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,740
Go tell the sheriff to
get up here and fast,

464
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:40,080
and bring everything he's got.

465
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,610
Get out of here.

466
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:44,410
And keep your eyes on the sky.

467
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,520
Do it.

468
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:07,610
- Lock your door.
- What's going on?

469
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:08,840
I don't know.

470
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:11,540
There's men under that trailer.

471
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,950
- Roll your window up.
- What's happening?

472
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:22,820
Come on!

473
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:38,070
Stop making noise.

474
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:41,280
- Who's that with you?
- Addison Brandon.

475
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:42,640
What's going on?

476
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:45,980
- I've got guns in the barn.
- Guns?

477
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,080
For what?

478
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:50,480
Do you think you
could make a run for it?

479
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:54,490
I'd do it myself if not for
my leg and this god-damn cane.

480
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:56,620
What about those
guys under the truck?

481
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:57,930
They won't move.

482
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:01,400
They think they know this
thing, they got a name for it.

483
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,970
Mr. Bernardy, what,
who are you hiding from?

484
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:08,000
I don't know, I've seen
it and I still don't know.

485
00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:10,740
Something came
down and got Apple.

486
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:11,840
Came down?

487
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:15,410
Spooked the horses so bad,

488
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:17,750
they jumped both the fences.

489
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,220
It tried to come
down at get Matheo.

490
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,320
What did?

491
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:24,820
Matheo put up a fight.

492
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,490
What are we talking about?

493
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:27,990
It dropped him out there somewhere.

494
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:34,900
No, no, no.

495
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:22,680
Come on.

496
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:04,920
Gaylen!

497
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:07,430
Gaylen Brandon!

498
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:12,330
Gaylen!

499
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:22,740
Mrs. Brandon?

500
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:28,680
Gaylen?

501
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,290
I've been calling you.

502
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:56,080
What the hell is the matter?

503
00:47:58,850 --> 00:47:59,850
It's here.

504
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:04,290
Is that what you came here to say?

505
00:48:09,230 --> 00:48:11,060
If it's not, it will be.

506
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:23,640
What happened?

507
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:27,380
Just tell me one thing.

508
00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:36,320
Did you bring something that can kill it?

509
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:42,160
He found it 23 years ago.

510
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:43,890
Kenny.

511
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:51,240
The night before he died.

512
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:57,480
It fell from the sky.

513
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,020
He didn't tell me he took it home,

514
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:08,290
or that he hid it in the hay stool.

515
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:15,860
The horses wouldn't stay
in the barn with it.

516
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,600
Mom, get the horses.

517
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:21,800
He wouldn't
say what was happening.

518
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:22,900
Mom, just get the horses!

519
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:32,050
He must have touched that thing,

520
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:35,920
and that was why he was
so angry and frightened.

521
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,330
He wanted to kill it, whatever it was.

522
00:49:54,270 --> 00:49:56,200
Maybe he thought he did.

523
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:13,290
I trapped it.

524
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,230
It's under there.

525
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:45,460
Be careful.

526
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:50,460
If you touch that thing,
if you put your hand on it,

527
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:53,130
you see.

528
00:51:02,610 --> 00:51:04,740
You see how it came to be.

529
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:12,620
And,

530
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,160
what it is.

531
00:51:58,100 --> 00:51:59,100
Buddy.

532
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:10,710
Bud?

533
00:52:20,190 --> 00:52:22,130
Seen a suspicious person.

534
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,150
Stay down.

535
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:01,670
Quick, can you see anything?

536
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,540
Like what?

537
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,240
There's knives
and stuff on both sides.

538
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:09,510
Can you reach one that
will cut your rope?

539
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:13,110
I tried, but it's hard for me to move.

540
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:29,570
You think her dead kid came
over the hill this morning

541
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:30,980
to tell her to vacate the premises?

542
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,370
What if she's right?

543
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:34,370
What if we can learn
that thing's secrets,

544
00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:37,970
just by touching that
piece of its own flesh?

545
00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:42,910
You're gonna go over there

546
00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:44,090
and hold hands with it, aren't ya?

547
00:53:44,110 --> 00:53:45,380
Just like she did.

548
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:48,880
What do you think this
is if it isn't a war?

549
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:51,020
War that absolutely won't stop,

550
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:54,560
until that damn thing
doesn't exist anymore!

551
00:53:58,230 --> 00:54:00,560
If this thing gets away again,

552
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:07,340
I'm either gonna be dead,
or too damn old next time.

553
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:18,310
What if the secret to
what this thing is,

554
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:22,750
is the secret of how to kill it?

555
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:54,790
Hurry.

556
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:01,260
Sometimes he comes back fast,
it's usually with another body

557
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:04,230
and you don't wanna
be here for that.

558
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:11,640
Kirk?

559
00:55:12,170 --> 00:55:14,810
- No way, Addie?
- Oh my god.

560
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:20,480
My leg, I can't walk on it.

561
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:25,080
But I could drag myself,
just get me out of this.

562
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:28,350
I checked.

563
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:30,090
They're dead.

564
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:33,030
He thinks I'm dead,
too, and probably you.

565
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:34,430
Why aren't we?

566
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:37,310
I was passed out when he
wrapped me and threw me in here.

567
00:55:37,330 --> 00:55:39,470
But from what I could tell,
I think he's in too big

568
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:41,870
of a hurry to care if we are or not.

569
00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:43,280
Yeah, well let's get out of here.

570
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:44,310
No!

571
00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:48,210
Only he opens those, you
try, it'll split you in two.

572
00:55:48,310 --> 00:55:51,510
This whole truck's a death-trap.

573
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:54,550
Maybe the front.

574
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:57,450
Try the driver's door.

575
00:55:58,590 --> 00:55:59,950
What do you see?

576
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:03,120
It just looks like a door handle.

577
00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:06,860
There's a chain, should I try that?

578
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:07,960
Try what?

579
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:10,380
I don't know, maybe
it does something.

580
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,440
Like maybe the horn.

581
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:22,010
Try that door handle.

582
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:30,990
Say a little prayer that
one of these doors opens.

583
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:45,500
Get behind him.

584
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:52,270
Get behind him.

585
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:07,920
Put your hands on him.

586
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:55,940
Danny.

587
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:02,510
I know where you're going.

588
00:59:07,490 --> 00:59:08,890
You will come back.

589
00:59:13,690 --> 00:59:14,690
Danny!

590
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,530
Danny!

591
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:19,200
Look at me, boss!

592
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:22,170
Sheriff!

593
00:59:23,870 --> 00:59:24,970
- Boss!
- Danny?

594
01:00:30,410 --> 01:00:31,410
Danny?

595
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:35,010
Danny!

596
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:38,750
Danny.

597
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:43,950
Look at me.

598
01:00:59,010 --> 01:01:00,010
I'm next.

599
01:01:03,010 --> 01:01:04,010
Boss?

600
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:10,320
Are you out of
your god-damn mind?

601
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:13,020
With all due respect,
sergeant, you stand down.

602
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:15,490
You don't tell me to stand down.

603
01:01:15,590 --> 01:01:16,620
You don't know!

604
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:21,400
Not like us.

605
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:32,970
You got no takeaway in this.

606
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:40,520
Alright.

607
01:01:42,150 --> 01:01:43,150
Alright.

608
01:01:47,290 --> 01:01:49,420
No!

609
01:01:49,530 --> 01:01:50,860
Stop, stop, stop!

610
01:01:51,730 --> 01:01:52,730
Get him off!

611
01:01:56,970 --> 01:01:58,010
Anybody out there read me?

612
01:01:58,070 --> 01:01:59,600
Repeat, Team Deputy...

613
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:00,700
Get off me!

614
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:05,570
Any team members
out there at all, copy me.

615
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:06,880
Repeat, Deputy Mike McGrail...

616
01:02:08,010 --> 01:02:09,010
Hello!

617
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:13,280
I got a flipped vehicle
in a field up Turvy Road.

618
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:15,120
And I mean upside-down
and still smokin'.

619
01:02:15,220 --> 01:02:16,820
It's headed to the nine.

620
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:18,200
Who is this, is that the sheriff?

621
01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:19,300
This is team leader Miller.

622
01:02:19,930 --> 01:02:21,890
We copy and are putting
rubber to the road.

623
01:02:21,990 --> 01:02:23,630
Maybe 15 minutes away.

624
01:02:23,730 --> 01:02:25,460
No lights, no sirens.

625
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:33,900
This thing hits the nine, we're
gonna take it by surprise.

626
01:02:34,010 --> 01:02:37,070
You and Brady, you
come in from the east.

627
01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:38,980
Miller, you and Jenkins,

628
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:43,210
see if you can find a road
that gets you in front of it.

629
01:02:45,990 --> 01:02:48,220
The point is to stay alive.

630
01:02:51,690 --> 01:02:54,830
It's what your old
man would have wanted.

631
01:03:03,740 --> 01:03:06,000
You find Addie and the two of
you get the hell outta here

632
01:03:06,110 --> 01:03:09,240
and don't come back until
I tell you different.

633
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:10,810
So you're just okay now?

634
01:03:10,910 --> 01:03:12,460
I just saw you rollin'
around on the ground

635
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,280
like you were having
your brain scrambled.

636
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:15,980
I can drive, Danny.

637
01:03:16,820 --> 01:03:17,820
Danny!

638
01:03:18,620 --> 01:03:22,320
Danny, god-damn it, move
over and let me in there!

639
01:03:22,420 --> 01:03:24,890
I got no idea, sheriff
up in Kissle says

640
01:03:24,990 --> 01:03:26,390
they can't even get
a man down here.

641
01:03:28,060 --> 01:03:30,060
Bud is really scarin' me.

642
01:03:30,170 --> 01:03:31,580
He's in some kind of
shock or something,

643
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:33,870
and he's not snapping out of it.

644
01:03:33,970 --> 01:03:37,400
- I'm getting ready to run him...
- I let her go.

645
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:42,410
I let her go.

646
01:03:46,820 --> 01:03:48,820
I couldn't hold on, Dad.

647
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:51,700
I let her go and now she's out there

648
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:53,390
with that thing somewhere.

649
01:03:53,490 --> 01:03:54,490
Sit.

650
01:03:55,830 --> 01:03:58,530
- I left her out there.
- Sit down.

651
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,730
- I left her, Dad!
- Sit down and stop.

652
01:04:01,830 --> 01:04:02,830
Stop talking.

653
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:12,820
All I know is that the truck
looks like it's been rolled.

654
01:04:12,910 --> 01:04:13,910
It's missing a god...

655
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:17,280
Jesus Christ.

656
01:04:18,350 --> 01:04:19,350
Bud!

657
01:04:29,030 --> 01:04:30,930
Holy Mary Mother of God.

658
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:32,960
You son of a bitch.

659
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:40,400
Straight with me, can we kill this thing?

660
01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:44,180
Are you still a sharpshooter?

661
01:04:45,610 --> 01:04:47,480
Bet your sweet ass I am.

662
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:53,520
Get me up closer to
that son of a bitch!

663
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:55,820
Take his tire out.

664
01:05:05,230 --> 01:05:06,430
Hit him again!

665
01:05:10,670 --> 01:05:13,410
What the hell are they made of?

666
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:15,840
Again!

667
01:05:22,050 --> 01:05:23,180
Son of a bitch!

668
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:38,600
What the hell?

669
01:05:59,490 --> 01:06:00,490
Mikey?

670
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:10,700
Oh, come here, you big ugly bastard!

671
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,700
- Oh, my sweet...
- Christ.

672
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:15,770
Everything ricochets off that truck.

673
01:06:15,870 --> 01:06:18,180
Mikey, come in, Mikey, listen to me.

674
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:20,040
That truck...

675
01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:22,410
Straight at it, Jenky, go!

676
01:06:28,290 --> 01:06:29,790
Mikey, come in!

677
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:31,560
Michael!

678
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:34,160
Don't shoot at the god-damn truck!

679
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:36,260
Mikey!

680
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:37,530
Do you read me?

681
01:06:44,270 --> 01:06:45,300
Mikey, come in.

682
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:50,810
Michael, pick up!

683
01:06:50,910 --> 01:06:52,880
Mikey, do you read me?

684
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:55,310
Don't shoot at that god-damn truck!

685
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:58,950
For my old man and 1,000 others, you ugly.

686
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:25,080
Hold on!

687
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:03,120
Danny?

688
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:27,510
Danny!

689
01:08:31,250 --> 01:08:32,250
Danny!

690
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:48,500
Take this!

691
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:51,600
Son of a...

692
01:08:59,810 --> 01:09:00,810
Cover me.

693
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:05,020
Davis!

694
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:08,920
Get down!

695
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:16,260
Don't give him what he wants.

696
01:09:18,530 --> 01:09:19,870
Swallow your fear.

697
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:23,770
Don't give it to him.

698
01:09:25,110 --> 01:09:27,140
You cover me as best you can.

699
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:30,040
Then you haul your ass outta here.

700
01:09:30,150 --> 01:09:32,750
It can't get both of us if we split up.

701
01:09:32,850 --> 01:09:33,850
Split up?

702
01:09:34,850 --> 01:09:37,120
We both gotta take him, Danny.

703
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:39,350
We need the firepower!

704
01:10:42,690 --> 01:10:43,690
Hey!

705
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:45,360
Hey, you!

706
01:11:08,420 --> 01:11:11,480
Davis, get the hell
out of here, move!

707
01:14:11,010 --> 01:14:14,340
Whatever you think
you can do, you can't.

708
01:14:16,350 --> 01:14:18,650
You're not gonna stop me.

709
01:14:20,390 --> 01:14:21,390
So go away.

710
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:25,560
It took her, Mom, it's got Addison now.

711
01:14:29,830 --> 01:14:30,830
What?

712
01:15:04,430 --> 01:15:05,770
Where's Addie?

713
01:18:53,510 --> 01:18:55,110
You have reached
the tri-county Sheriff's

714
01:18:55,140 --> 01:18:59,040
department, servicing Baniff,
Trotula and Poho Counties.

715
01:18:59,150 --> 01:19:01,350
This line is for emergency calls only.

716
01:19:01,450 --> 01:19:04,020
If this is an emergency,
please hold the line.

717
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:08,450
Addie?

718
01:21:38,010 --> 01:21:42,080
Every 23rd spring
for 23 days, it gets to eat.

719
01:21:44,820 --> 01:21:46,360
That's what we know.

720
01:21:48,530 --> 01:21:52,160
And the terrible things
it leaves in its wake,

721
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:55,860
missing fathers and mothers,

722
01:21:57,700 --> 01:21:59,270
brothers, sisters,

723
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:03,510
daughters and sons.

724
01:22:06,180 --> 01:22:07,480
We know that, too.

725
01:22:12,650 --> 01:22:15,150
The creature reshapes our minds,

726
01:22:16,490 --> 01:22:19,390
and changes the course of our lives.

727
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:56,460
What are you doing here?

728
01:22:56,560 --> 01:23:00,500
They're picking me up here,
I didn't miss 'em, did I?

729
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:04,540
- They're picking you up here?
- So I could say goodbye.

730
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:07,170
They don't care,
it's on the way.

731
01:23:08,380 --> 01:23:10,610
Really, are you doing okay?

732
01:23:11,850 --> 01:23:15,150
I'm out of the house, out in the sunshine.

733
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:17,420
And back with your
old boyfriend, huh?

734
01:23:22,090 --> 01:23:24,160
They say it's gone, you know.

735
01:23:24,260 --> 01:23:26,090
You really believe it?

736
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:28,030
Gone for another 23 years?

737
01:23:28,130 --> 01:23:32,070
You think we'll still be
around here to find out?

738
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:44,780
I'm gonna worry about you.

739
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:46,430
I can't believe they're letting you go.

740
01:23:46,450 --> 01:23:47,460
The last time we made it to state.

741
01:23:47,490 --> 01:23:49,520
I don't think Armageddon
will keep us from goin'.

742
01:23:49,550 --> 01:23:50,550
Is that your dad talking?

743
01:23:51,090 --> 01:23:53,320
I got a family who live in Bolander.

744
01:23:53,420 --> 01:23:55,160
I might stay an extra day.

745
01:23:55,260 --> 01:23:56,090
I'm gonna miss you.

746
01:23:56,190 --> 01:23:59,060
Well, I'll miss you more, I'll bet.

747
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:02,330
Keep an eye on my truck for me.

748
01:24:35,940 --> 01:24:38,300
At the end of those 23 days,

749
01:24:38,410 --> 01:24:41,870
in an open field by a
broken down school bus,

750
01:24:42,210 --> 01:24:44,310
it once again ran out of time,

751
01:24:44,410 --> 01:24:47,280
at the rusty tip of a homemade harpoon.

752
01:24:47,380 --> 01:24:50,220
But most of you know this already.

753
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:53,120
I record these words as a testament.

754
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:57,620
This 23rd spring is a call to arms.

755
01:24:58,290 --> 01:25:01,330
We will not fail and we will not fear.

756
01:25:04,070 --> 01:25:06,170
My name is Trisha Jenner,

757
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:10,170
and this time when it comes,

758
01:25:10,410 --> 01:25:14,310
I will destroy the thing
that killed by brother.

759
01:25:17,710 --> 01:25:18,710
So...

760
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:22,980
Come and get me,
you son of a bitch.
