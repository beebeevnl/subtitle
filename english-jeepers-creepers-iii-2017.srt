1
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,252
Help!

2
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:15,552
Stop!

3
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:17,252
God!

4
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:22,802
Help!

5
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:16,652
<i>Every 23rd year, for 23 days,
it gets to eat.</i>

6
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,887
And the things it leaves behind,

7
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:24,218
like the thing it left
in Poho County that night,

8
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:26,830
the nightmare on four wheels,

9
00:03:27,212 --> 00:03:29,120
was a horror all its own.

10
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,211
Go get the sergeant.

11
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:47,592
Sergeant!

12
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:50,682
Sergeant!

13
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,349
We got the truck open.

14
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,370
Five...

15
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,837
Goddamn slaughterhouse on wheels.

16
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:25,717
Police scanner.

17
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,758
It's been listening to us.

18
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,185
Whatever it is.

19
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:37,771
Some of this stuff, I don't
wanna know what it's made of.

20
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:40,103
Where the hell's that tow truck?

21
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,563
En route.

22
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,943
Coroner's still down near the jail.

23
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,866
Should I get him up here?

24
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,162
Those aren't for sewing.

25
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,790
I don't wanna know for what.

26
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:16,890
Get that goddamn thing in the impound!

27
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:58,773
Oh, my God.

28
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:34,220
I don't believe it.

29
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:39,434
Jesus Christ, where the hell have you been?

30
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,186
How many you lose tonight?

31
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,144
You hold it together and you answer me.

32
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,697
Three officers, an inmate down in the jail...

33
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,360
And then the kid.

34
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:56,164
The one he flew off with. Name of Jerry.

35
00:06:57,876 --> 00:06:59,742
His name was Darry Jenner!

36
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:00,917
His sister's a train wreck.

37
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:03,920
She's inside waiting for her folks,
they're driving in from Stillwater.

38
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:06,590
Where's the last place you saw it?

39
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,218
Don't touch that, and stay back!

40
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,200
Show me.

41
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,576
We threw everything we had at it, Danny.

42
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:19,155
All the fire and manpower
this building had to offer.

43
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,710
And it just made a whole lot of noise
and flew off with exactly what it wanted.

44
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:27,167
Sheriff!

45
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:28,839
Don't you want us tailing that truck?

46
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,506
They just towed it out of here.

47
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,552
Oh, no, no, no, no!

48
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:37,431
Can't raise 'em.
They're not answering any frequency!

49
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,637
- Where are they taking it?
- To impound, where else?

50
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:42,678
Jesus Christ, we couldn't leave it
sitting there! You saw what it did!

51
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,138
We gotta get an armada around that thing.

52
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:47,058
You make it happen, now! Anybody, everybody!

53
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:49,360
Get on out there! Move fast!

54
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,483
Just a goddamn minute Danny.

55
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:54,816
You tell me how the hell
you know about any of this!

56
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,572
'Cause what happened here, happened before!

57
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:01,867
You think that thing torched that church
tonight because it wanted a campfire?

58
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,870
It was destroying information!

59
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,077
Trying to get rid of what
it doesn't want us to know!

60
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:07,252
And that truck?

61
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:09,295
That truck is that thing's rolling history.

62
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,965
Which is why we get it
in the impound and tear it apart!

63
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,544
It ain't gonna make it to the impound!

64
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,511
Looks like a Rio.

65
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:25,972
An old Chevy Cab-o.

66
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:29,650
Cab over engine, I'd say 1940s.

67
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:33,696
That cow-catcher's gotta be custom.

68
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:37,195
You wanna tell me what the hell a truck
like that needs a cow-catcher for?

69
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:44,160
If you knew what was inside that thing,
that wouldn't be your only question.

70
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,132
<i>Dana, listen up and listen good!</i>

71
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:56,131
<i>I'm sending units to you right now.</i>

72
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:57,507
<i>Code 3, you read me?</i>

73
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,714
- <i>Code 3!</i>
- Come again Sergeant?

74
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:02,175
<i>Just tell that driver
to put his foot on the gas</i>

75
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:06,888
<i>and drive like hell to....</i>

76
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,027
What the hell?

77
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,871
- What is that?
- Jesus Christ!

78
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:32,045
Holy shit!

79
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,003
<i>Fear...</i>

80
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,960
has a scent.

81
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:22,888
And I've seen that thing inhale it.

82
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:30,392
Like it could sample fear,
right out of the air.

83
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:34,267
Dispatch, this is Lang with
the impound vehicle, please respond.

84
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,694
<i>That's how it picks what parts of us to eat.</i>

85
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,237
Captain are you in range?

86
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:40,110
<i>And it eats...</i>

87
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,407
This is Dana.

88
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,279
We have a situation with the impound vehicle.

89
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,110
<i>To rebuild itself.</i>

90
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:53,785
You hear that?

91
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,834
It's coming back.

92
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:23,903
What the...

93
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,410
Stop! Stop!

94
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:14,037
Frank! Frank!

95
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,039
<i>It never hunts in the same place</i>

96
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,370
<i>for more than a day.</i>

97
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:21,419
<i>It's done with Poho County.</i>

98
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:27,346
All we can do now is head north
and follow the birds.

99
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:33,636
<i>It's not much, but it's all we know.</i>

100
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,639
<i>Ravens and crows.</i>

101
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:40,272
They travel when it does.

102
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:48,363
Davis, I've looked that
ugly thing eye-to-eye.

103
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,869
23 years ago.

104
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,449
I know it.

105
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:58,914
And it knows me.

106
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:33,217
Why do you do this?

107
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:35,925
It hurts too much.

108
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:40,604
- Seeing you like this...
- Mom, just listen, okay?

109
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:42,973
Time's up.

110
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,150
It's coming back, just like I said.

111
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,189
- Why?
- Stop asking.

112
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,270
It doesn't matter.

113
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:52,404
You tell me why it's coming here.

114
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,200
Pieces of it left behind.

115
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:55,949
They're full of secrets about it.

116
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,451
That's what's buried up here?

117
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,292
A piece of it?

118
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,834
There's no more time. It's coming here,
and you can't be here when it does.

119
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:08,290
- How do you know it's coming?
- I'm a part of it now!

120
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,467
How many times do I have to tell you that?

121
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:13,587
It knows what's buried here,
and it will come and take it back.

122
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:17,682
Oh, killing you wasn't enough?
Why didn't it take it 23 years ago?

123
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,225
It ran out of time!

124
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:20,598
It always runs out of time.

125
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,600
I can't keep telling you this.

126
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:28,109
If you won't leave to save yourself,
then do it to save Addison.

127
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:31,071
Addison?

128
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:33,733
<i>Addison?</i>

129
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:39,162
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

130
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,997
<i>Do you think we have any money?</i>

131
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:47,170
<i>Kenny...</i>

132
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,122
<i>are you listening to yourself?</i>

133
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:51,254
<i>Are you listening to yourself?</i>

134
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,506
<i>How are we supposed to do that?</i>

135
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,389
<i>Where are we supposed to go?</i>

136
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,767
<i>Ugh, just leave!</i>

137
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,516
<i>Just pack up and go!</i>

138
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,188
<i>Pack up everything...</i>

139
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:05,987
Leave it where?

140
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:09,522
It knows it's here, Mom, 'cause
I'm a part of it, and it's a part of me.

141
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:12,991
Today, tomorrow, or sometime soon
it is going to walk up this hill

142
00:17:13,072 --> 00:17:15,729
and it is going to dig this thing up
right where I'm standing.

143
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,202
And when it comes...

144
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,123
it'll kill anyone that's still here.

145
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:28,249
Go away, mom.

146
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,129
Now.

147
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:08,747
Good morning, handsome.

148
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,673
Hey, you hungry buddy?

149
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,260
Damn.

150
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:24,472
Come on.

151
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:26,603
Gotta go talk to Grandma.

152
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:27,770
I don't want to do it alone.

153
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:57,463
Grandma?

154
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,258
Are you okay?

155
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,687
I'm taking the truck into town.

156
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:15,110
We need hay.

157
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,693
Who's going to pay for it?

158
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:23,785
I was thinking maybe we still
had some credit at Hooks'?

159
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,362
He called again.

160
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:28,324
We owe them more than we can pay.

161
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:31,827
Cal did say that he...

162
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:33,628
Grandma, no.

163
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:34,500
Addy...

164
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,207
I already told you,
I'm not selling Rocket, Grandma.

165
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,253
Selling him would be like
giving away my own child.

166
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:45,390
What a good mother might have to do
so that child wouldn't go hungry.

167
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,638
I want you to go away for a few days.

168
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,817
Maybe stay with Gracie?

169
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,565
Why?

170
00:19:57,655 --> 00:19:58,691
Can you?

171
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:05,076
Is there something that you
don't want me here for?

172
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,155
Yes.

173
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:18,082
Unexpected company.

174
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,387
You've got your team.

175
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,556
You got experienced men who know this thing.

176
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,224
The team is more than law enforcement.

177
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:34,123
The team of shopkeeps, farmers, anyone
who's looked this thing eye-to-eye

178
00:20:34,204 --> 00:20:37,271
and lived to tell about it
and wants to do something about it!

179
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,612
Davis! Davis!

180
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:45,692
Hey!

181
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:49,658
You the best goddamn sharpshooter in all
of Poho county, or any other county.

182
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:52,082
You got questions about that too, now?

183
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:54,500
When I raised my gun to that thing,

184
00:20:55,581 --> 00:20:57,632
I couldn't pull the goddamn trigger

185
00:20:58,113 --> 00:21:00,390
'cause I couldn't believe
what the hell I was looking at.

186
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:04,344
This thing rewrites all the rules, Danny.

187
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,138
And going after it...

188
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:10,015
It scares the hell out of me.

189
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,139
A brave man is either scared...

190
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:16,143
or he's a goddamn liar.

191
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:36,584
Boss.

192
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:38,704
Michael.

193
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:52,471
This his old man's truck?

194
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:17,500
It's an old vulcan cannon.

195
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:22,289
She's amped up to shoot 20 millimeter
rounds, 6,000 rounds a minute.

196
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:23,373
You test this thing?

197
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:26,505
Mikey.

198
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:29,679
Is this thing tested?

199
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,722
This thing throws up a wall of fire.

200
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:36,056
A wall of fire that nothing from this world
or the next can get through!

201
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,556
Not without being torn into a million pieces.

202
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:48,945
She may not fly,
but this is our killing machine.

203
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:57,665
Davis!

204
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:03,788
He watched that thing fly down
and punch a hole in his old man.

205
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:08,444
He stood there and watched it pull
the heart right out of his daddy's chest

206
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:11,934
and swallowed it, right before his eyes.

207
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:15,392
Miller was only ten years old!

208
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,096
You're not losing your mind, Davis.

209
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,691
You just got blooded last night.

210
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:32,200
Now you want to guess
how much blood I got on my hands?

211
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:35,863
You've seen that thing, now.

212
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,290
So you got blood on your hands too.

213
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,912
And no matter what you do,
it's gonna stay there.

214
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,880
Whether you walk away or not.

215
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:55,799
Rendezvous at station one!

216
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,719
North!

217
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:19,910
Howdy!

218
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,788
Can I bag some hay off you?

219
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:29,124
Sure, stranger.

220
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:31,175
Our horses are up in Boulder.

221
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:33,503
You're not up there
with Rocket winning trophies?

222
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:36,590
Can't even afford the gas
to drive up there right now.

223
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:39,597
What's the matter, your grandma?

224
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:42,145
Yeah, she was up on
the hill again this morning.

225
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:45,099
Screaming at the wind, calling it Kenny?

226
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,229
Didn't he die like 20 years ago?

227
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,144
Mom!

228
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,157
You know you got a rabbit in that trap?

229
00:24:58,247 --> 00:24:59,488
- That's what it's there for.
- So it's suffering!

230
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,117
You just gonna leave it in there?

231
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:03,992
Mom!

232
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:10,248
- Mom, he's got a rabbit in the trap.
- Hey, Addy, long time no see.

233
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:14,210
- Mom said they were eating up her garden.
- I didn't say you should trap them.

234
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:16,800
- You didn't say I shouldn't!
- How's your grandma doing?

235
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:20,058
He doesn't care about the garden.
He traps them because he likes killing them!

236
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:21,430
He's sick!

237
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,975
I mean, who likes to trap
and kill things for fun, huh?

238
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:28,003
Psychos, maybe? He's too stupid
to even know he is one.

239
00:25:28,084 --> 00:25:30,943
Alright, stop. And you, take care
of this before you leave.

240
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,396
By which I mean, let it go.

241
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,651
It's not in any pain.

242
00:25:34,742 --> 00:25:37,242
Don't leave it in the trap.
It's cruel, honey.

243
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:42,579
Stop!

244
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:45,287
It's a rabbit, mom. Do you know
how small their brains are?

245
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,086
- Ten times bigger than yours?
- Well, then you let it out!

246
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:50,880
And I hope it bites you.
It's a wild animal, idiot.

247
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,582
It's kill or be killed.

248
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:56,044
Just let it go and stop trapping them, okay?

249
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:57,800
You're all a bunch of women.

250
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:01,133
Kirk.

251
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,558
Get back here.

252
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:06,391
Tell 'em about the law
of the jungle, will you, Addy?

253
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,433
Kirk, get out of the car and let it go.

254
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,196
What's out in the hay barn?

255
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,447
Dad took what we had.

256
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,448
That's okay.

257
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:23,200
I'm on my way to Hooks' anyway.

258
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,160
Oh, are you?

259
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,661
Yes, and shut up.

260
00:26:27,628 --> 00:26:29,836
Buddy Hooks' got a huge crush on Addy, Mom.

261
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:34,044
But neither one of them are brave
enough to do anything about it.

262
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:37,878
You wouldn't want to come
with me to Hooks', would you?

263
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:39,212
And get in the way?

264
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,559
Do you like him or not?

265
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:49,014
He does have a really cute butt.

266
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:53,275
And from that springs love!

267
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:11,453
Idiot.

268
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,660
What the hell is that?

269
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:07,141
Somebody just ditched it out here?

270
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:08,513
Hell, I would.

271
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,308
What do you think's in it?

272
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:12,388
Rust and cow shit.

273
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:13,893
What do you think's in it?

274
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:22,319
No way.

275
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,695
Oh, hell no!

276
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,155
"No way" what?

277
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:26,827
Look at that license plate.

278
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,247
"Beating you?"

279
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,996
"B-Eating You," and no fucking way!

280
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:34,418
Right.

281
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:36,416
No way, that story's bullshit.

282
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,044
No, no. I heard it really happened.

283
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,341
Yeah, I did too.

284
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:42,259
Real people disappeared.

285
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:43,553
20 years ago.

286
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,130
23, and it's just a story.

287
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:47,761
What story?

288
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,843
The guy who drove around and ate people!

289
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:53,681
In a scary-ass old truck
with that license plate.

290
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:56,649
Jeepers creepers.

291
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:00,937
What?

292
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:02,988
Wasn't that the song
the guy sang or something?

293
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:07,698
Look, it's homemade.

294
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:11,622
At least one idiot every Halloween
makes a license plate that says that.

295
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,449
You think it just drove in?

296
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:15,000
The tracks look fresh.

297
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:21,541
You think somebody could be in there?

298
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:23,968
Yeah, it's warm!

299
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:25,511
Of course it's warm, you dipshit.

300
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,338
It's been sitting out in the sun.

301
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,886
Who'd dump it out here?

302
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:31,184
Who wouldn't?

303
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,353
Hello?

304
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:44,397
Can't see shit.

305
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:46,733
I'd say we beat it in case they come back.

306
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:50,286
Anybody in there?

307
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:56,993
<i>Hey! Hello in there!</i>

308
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:01,080
What the fuck is wrong with you man?

309
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,164
What?

310
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:03,045
I was just knocking.

311
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:04,592
Well, don't! Idiot.

312
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,130
What's this thing on the front?

313
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:12,224
What thing?

314
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,974
This thing I'm peeing on.

315
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,600
It's a cow catcher.

316
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:19,523
They put it on front of trains
back in the old days.

317
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,350
Who'd put it on a truck?

318
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:25,317
This thing is made up
of so many different parts.

319
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,566
It's like a frickin' Frankenstein truck.

320
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:37,246
Man, I say we get the hell out of here.

321
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:40,500
Wait, break the windows first?

322
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:42,080
Hell yes, we do!

323
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:44,291
We gotta kill Frankenstein's truck, right?

324
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:46,793
Dibs on the windshield!

325
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,966
Kiss my ass, you ugly old bitch!

326
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,350
Oh!

327
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:00,519
You see that?

328
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:02,817
Thing tried to kill me,
nicked my fuckin' ear.

329
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:07,272
Maybe it tries to kill things
more stupid than it.

330
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:25,707
What the hell?

331
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,756
Those can't be real.

332
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,222
Those flies are real.

333
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,640
That smell is real.

334
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:43,520
Oh, jeez...

335
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:50,299
Hey, you.

336
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:55,004
You gonna be driving up to see us?

337
00:32:56,516 --> 00:33:00,180
Go Eaton Valley, right?

338
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,353
So, ten bales of Alfalfa?

339
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:06,728
Right.

340
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,532
No Grandma today, huh?

341
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:17,944
How's she doing?

342
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:28,287
You're not on the load list.

343
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,382
D'you want to talk to my dad?

344
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:42,552
Do you want me to?

345
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:46,814
I should put her on my load list.

346
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:51,648
You know why she lives
with her grandma, right?

347
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:55,805
Addy couldn't get along with her stepdad,
so instead of kicking him out,

348
00:33:55,886 --> 00:33:58,864
her mom ships her ass out here
to live with her crazy grandma.

349
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:04,160
Can you really blame me, though?
I mean look at her.

350
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,451
The heart wants what it wants, am I right?

351
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:08,662
Yeah.

352
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,667
And mine wants you to shut the fuck up.

353
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:14,258
So...

354
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:16,969
I'm just going to go to Carlin's and see
if we have some credit out there.

355
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,423
Hey, just wait a minute...

356
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,726
What happened?

357
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:29,682
Bernardi's.

358
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:32,359
Load it up and get it out there now,
he's waiting for it.

359
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:35,939
What are you doing?

360
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:38,120
She loves that horse more
than anything in the world,

361
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:40,326
and right now it's got nothing to eat.

362
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:41,994
'Cause they're broke!

363
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,572
You think we're ever going
to see the money that they owe us?

364
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:45,827
The state's not even
sending them checks anymore.

365
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,954
And how do you know that?

366
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:50,536
Biggs down at the post office.
How do you think?

367
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,916
Make your point, dad.

368
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,169
You can do better.

369
00:34:56,553 --> 00:34:57,714
That's my point.

370
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,476
Got some hay for you!

371
00:35:12,986 --> 00:35:14,477
Turn that thing around!

372
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,897
Let's get your horse some breakfast.

373
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,275
Whats the problem?

374
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,861
I thought you said you have a hungry horse.

375
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,366
<i>Get it out!</i>

376
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:38,460
<i>We gotta call someone!</i>

377
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,840
- <i>Just get it the hell out!</i>
- What do you want us to do?

378
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,216
Alright, it's long enough. I can pull it out.

379
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:43,423
Do you want me to pull it out?

380
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:44,472
Just call someone!

381
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:49,099
There's no fucking service out here so
shut up about the goddamn phone, alright?

382
00:35:49,189 --> 00:35:50,396
Kirk, look at me!

383
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:51,814
Just do something!

384
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,612
Like what?

385
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,228
What the fuck do you want us to do?

386
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:56,811
You want us to try and pull it out?

387
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,322
Alright, hold him up.

388
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:07,162
Oh, shit.

389
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:13,873
Okay on three, you ready?

390
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,252
Hold him steady, come on!

391
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:21,795
On three I'm going to pull like
a son of a bitch, you guys ready?

392
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:24,971
One!

393
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:27,466
Two!

394
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:42,781
Oh, sh...

395
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,780
Fuck!

396
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:46,906
What the fuck?

397
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:50,239
Help, help!

398
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,666
No, no, Help!

399
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,243
Help!

400
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:56,169
Red!

401
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:58,623
Red! Red!

402
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:00,465
Red!

403
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:07,548
Help!

404
00:37:12,272 --> 00:37:14,730
No! Help! No!

405
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:15,727
No!

406
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:19,102
No! Help!

407
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:22,984
- Don't leave me.
- I'm not!

408
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,815
I don't know what to do.

409
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:25,899
Maybe we could cut the cable.

410
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:27,075
With what?

411
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:28,323
Try the phone again.

412
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,200
- Oh, my God...
- Come on!

413
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:11,175
So this is the famous Rocket, huh?

414
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:14,842
He's a beauty.

415
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:17,144
You understand what I'm saying, don't you?

416
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,937
Every word you're saying.

417
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:19,729
Yeah?

418
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:23,897
Well, in that case,
do you think Addy here would ever

419
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:27,822
be interested in seeing a guy like me?

420
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,672
In the city...

421
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:48,629
my mother and I had a cat.

422
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,803
Addy...

423
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:52,300
I liked the cat.

424
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:58,557
Crapped in her boyfriend's shoes
every chance it got.

425
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:01,354
What happened to the boyfriend?

426
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:06,189
She married him.

427
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,939
They got rid of the cat.

428
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,115
Look I...

429
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:20,290
I'm not great at this,
and when I get nervous I start

430
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:22,242
talking too much.

431
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:28,043
I...

432
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:48,769
Is that your grandmother?

433
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,912
Thank you for the hay, but please just go.

434
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,544
Okay.

435
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:12,752
You wouldn't want to come?

436
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:19,516
I mean, I gotta get the rest of this stuff
up to Bernardi's. You ever been up there?

437
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:21,430
It's really something.

438
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:24,563
I mean, only if you want to.

439
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:26,140
I'd love to.

440
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:28,559
Okay.

441
00:42:02,145 --> 00:42:03,306
What are you doing?

442
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:07,265
- I need to know what you found.
- Mom, what are you doing?

443
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,145
And why it killed you for it.

444
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:10,021
No, you don't.

445
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:11,397
You don't want to see what it'll show you.

446
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:12,853
Go!

447
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,688
Away!

448
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:17,149
Go!

449
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:40,862
Hey!

450
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:41,908
Stop!

451
00:43:45,373 --> 00:43:46,409
Stop!

452
00:43:46,499 --> 00:43:47,410
Hey!

453
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,832
Stop!

454
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:03,131
<i>Come on, Gaylen, you out there?</i>

455
00:44:03,224 --> 00:44:05,682
I got a lot of units
headed out to station one.

456
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,260
What is that, a roll bar?

457
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:10,895
You reinforce this thing?

458
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:17,528
First time I met Gaylen was 23 years ago.

459
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:20,939
On the worst night of her life.

460
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:26,154
Her son Kenny and his date, Dara Cleeway,

461
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:28,079
disappeared on the way to the prom.

462
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,788
All they found was
a red pickup and no bodies.

463
00:44:33,296 --> 00:44:36,091
When Gaylen finally believed
what happened to Kenny,

464
00:44:37,672 --> 00:44:40,024
she asked if she could join the team.

465
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:44,300
That was the beginning for me.

466
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:49,388
Like last night was the beginning for you.

467
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:31,028
No!

468
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:32,158
Oh, my...

469
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:10,074
That looks like Wildfire.

470
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:12,027
That's a $200,000 horse.

471
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:13,783
Yeah, and that looks like Nightmare with her.

472
00:47:13,873 --> 00:47:14,784
What are they doing out?

473
00:47:14,874 --> 00:47:16,615
I don't know.

474
00:47:33,351 --> 00:47:34,558
Where is everybody?

475
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:51,775
<i>Buddy!</i>

476
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:55,786
<i>Buddy!</i>

477
00:48:05,925 --> 00:48:06,540
Hurry!

478
00:48:10,763 --> 00:48:12,550
Go tell the sheriff to get up here, and fast!

479
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,051
Bring everything he's got.

480
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:18,682
Get out of here,
and keep your eyes on the sky!

481
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:20,929
Do it!

482
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:42,792
Lock your door.

483
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:43,549
What's going on?

484
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:44,961
I don't know.

485
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:46,754
There's men under that trailer.

486
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:52,051
Roll your window up.

487
00:48:52,138 --> 00:48:53,424
What's happening?

488
00:48:58,394 --> 00:48:59,510
Come on!

489
00:49:13,409 --> 00:49:14,991
Stop making noise!

490
00:49:16,162 --> 00:49:17,118
<i>Who's that with you?</i>

491
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:18,661
Addison Brandon.

492
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:20,033
What's going on?

493
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,077
I got guns in the barn.

494
00:49:22,168 --> 00:49:23,284
Guns?

495
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:24,538
For what?

496
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:27,086
Do you think you could make a run for it?

497
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:32,087
I'd do it myself if it weren't for
this leg and this goddamn cane.

498
00:49:32,178 --> 00:49:34,135
What about those guys under the truck?

499
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,962
They won't move.

500
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:38,173
They think they know this thing.

501
00:49:38,267 --> 00:49:39,303
They got a name for it.

502
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:40,600
Mr. Bernardi, what...

503
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:41,893
who are you hiding from?

504
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:43,140
<i>I don't know!</i>

505
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,142
<i>I've seen it and I still don't know.</i>

506
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,017
Something came down and got Babaloo.

507
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:50,397
Came down?

508
00:49:52,281 --> 00:49:55,445
<i>Spooked the horses so bad
they jumped both the fences.</i>

509
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,739
<i>It tried to come down and get me too.</i>

510
00:49:58,829 --> 00:49:59,945
What did?

511
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:03,539
<i>Let me tell you, I put up a fight.</i>

512
00:50:03,626 --> 00:50:05,367
What are we talking about?

513
00:50:05,461 --> 00:50:06,622
<i>I dropped them out there somewhere...</i>

514
00:53:05,641 --> 00:53:08,475
<i>Gaylen!</i>

515
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,017
Gaylen Brandon!

516
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:15,223
Hello Gaylen!

517
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:25,070
Mrs. Brandon?

518
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:31,830
Gaylen?

519
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:40,548
I've been calling you.

520
00:53:57,693 --> 00:53:59,229
What the hell is the matter?

521
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:04,522
He's here.

522
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:07,821
Is that what you came here to say?

523
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:16,247
'Cause if not, he will be.

524
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:28,638
What happened?

525
00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:32,888
Just tell me one thing.

526
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,063
Did you bring something that can kill it?

527
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:47,611
He found it 23 years ago.

528
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:49,780
Kenny.

529
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,957
The night before he died.

530
00:55:01,882 --> 00:55:04,374
It fell from the sky.

531
00:55:10,641 --> 00:55:14,888
He didn't tell me he took it home
or that he hid it in the hay store.

532
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:22,559
<i>The horses wouldn't stay in the barn with it.</i>

533
00:55:22,653 --> 00:55:24,895
Mom, get the horses!

534
00:55:26,907 --> 00:55:29,115
<i>He wouldn't say what was happening.</i>

535
00:55:29,201 --> 00:55:30,658
Mom, just get the horses!

536
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:40,418
<i>He must've touched that thing,
and that was why he</i>

537
00:55:40,504 --> 00:55:43,372
<i>was so angry and frightened.</i>

538
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:59,270
He wanted to kill it, whatever it was.

539
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:04,149
Maybe he thought he did.

540
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:22,501
I trapped him.

541
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:30,630
It's under there.

542
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:55,234
Be careful!

543
00:56:56,622 --> 00:57:01,248
If you touch that thing,
if you put your hand on it...

544
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:03,876
You see.

545
00:57:13,305 --> 00:57:15,797
You see...

546
00:57:15,891 --> 00:57:18,133
how it came to be.

547
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:26,938
And what it is.

548
00:58:10,988 --> 00:58:11,978
Buddy...

549
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:23,739
Bud?

550
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:57,023
Stay down.

551
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:16,592
Quick, can you see anything?

552
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:19,379
What?

553
00:59:19,473 --> 00:59:21,180
There's knives and stuff on both sides.

554
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:23,258
Can you reach one and I cut your rope?

555
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:29,139
I tried, but it's hard for me to move.

556
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:46,869
You think her dead kid came over the hill this
morning to tell her to vacate the premises?

557
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:48,369
What if she's right?

558
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:50,827
What if she can learn
that thing's secrets just by

559
00:59:50,921 --> 00:59:53,664
touching that piece of its own flesh.

560
00:59:58,136 --> 01:00:00,294
You're going to go over there
and hold hands with it, aren't you?

561
01:00:00,388 --> 01:00:01,799
Just like she did.

562
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:05,516
What do you think this is if it isn't a war?

563
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:10,972
One that absolutely won't stop until
that damn thing doesn't exist anymore.

564
01:00:15,195 --> 01:00:17,357
This thing gets away again...

565
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:22,988
I'm either going to be dead

566
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:26,793
or too damn old next time.

567
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:36,691
What if the secret to what this thing is

568
01:00:38,072 --> 01:00:41,895
is the secret of how to kill it?

569
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:14,080
Hurry!

570
01:01:17,591 --> 01:01:19,298
Sometimes he comes back fast.

571
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:22,088
It's usually with another body
and you don't want to be here for that.

572
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:31,560
Kirk?

573
01:01:31,646 --> 01:01:33,683
- No fucking way, Addy.
- Oh, my God.

574
01:01:37,903 --> 01:01:39,986
My leg. I can't walk on it.

575
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:43,360
But I can drive myself just get...
get me out of this.

576
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:48,573
I checked.

577
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:50,738
They're dead.

578
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:53,449
He thinks I'm dead too, and probably you.

579
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:55,205
Why aren't we?

580
01:01:55,295 --> 01:01:57,833
I was passed out when he
wrapped me and threw me in here.

581
01:01:57,923 --> 01:02:02,633
But from what I could tell, I think he was in
too big of a hurry to care if we are or not.

582
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:03,800
Yeah, well, let's get out of here.

583
01:02:03,887 --> 01:02:04,627
No!

584
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:07,095
Only he opens those.

585
01:02:07,182 --> 01:02:08,969
You try, it'll split you in two.

586
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:10,766
This whole fucking truck is a death trap.

587
01:02:14,356 --> 01:02:15,813
Maybe the front.

588
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:18,228
Try the driver's door.

589
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:20,935
What do you see?

590
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:23,983
It just looks like a door handle.

591
01:02:25,617 --> 01:02:28,530
There's a chain, should I try that?

592
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:29,610
Try what?

593
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:30,911
I don't know, maybe it does something.

594
01:02:39,798 --> 01:02:41,084
I think maybe the horn.

595
01:02:42,259 --> 01:02:43,500
Try the door handle.

596
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:51,890
Say a little prayer that one
of these doors opens.

597
01:04:09,346 --> 01:04:10,462
Get behind him.

598
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:17,217
Get.

599
01:04:17,979 --> 01:04:19,595
Behind him.

600
01:04:32,077 --> 01:04:33,363
Put your hands on him.

601
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:23,791
Danny.

602
01:05:28,133 --> 01:05:29,749
I know where you're going.

603
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:36,972
You will come back.

604
01:05:41,855 --> 01:05:42,720
Danny!

605
01:05:42,814 --> 01:05:44,305
No!

606
01:05:44,399 --> 01:05:45,310
Danny!

607
01:05:46,443 --> 01:05:47,775
Look at me boss!

608
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:50,815
Sheriff!

609
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:53,901
- Boss!
- Danny!

610
01:07:02,977 --> 01:07:04,513
Danny?

611
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:07,687
Danny?

612
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:13,857
Danny, look at me.

613
01:07:32,549 --> 01:07:33,665
I'm next.

614
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:37,755
Boss?

615
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:44,050
Are you out of your goddamn mind?

616
01:07:44,143 --> 01:07:46,931
With all due respect, sergeant,
you stand down.

617
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:49,354
You don't tell me to stand down.

618
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:50,851
You don't know!

619
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:56,228
Not like us.

620
01:08:05,456 --> 01:08:07,288
You got no takeaway in this.

621
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:15,418
Alright.

622
01:08:17,302 --> 01:08:18,292
Alright.

623
01:08:22,682 --> 01:08:23,763
No!

624
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:24,636
What are you...

625
01:08:24,726 --> 01:08:27,013
Stop, stop!

626
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:28,139
Get him off!

627
01:08:32,066 --> 01:08:33,728
<i>...anybody out there read me?</i>

628
01:08:33,818 --> 01:08:35,150
<i>Repeat, this is Deputy Michael...</i>

629
01:08:35,236 --> 01:08:36,443
Get off me!

630
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:42,278
Any team members out there
at all copy me? Repeat!

631
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:44,909
<i>- Deputy Mike McGrail...</i>
- Go!

632
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:48,814
<i>I've got a flipped vehicle
in a field off Kearney Road,</i>

633
01:08:49,395 --> 01:08:51,457
<i>and I mean upside-down and still smoking.</i>

634
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:54,419
- It's headed to the Nine.
<i>- Who is this? Is that the sheriff?</i>

635
01:08:54,505 --> 01:08:57,414
This is Team Leader Miller. We copy
and are putting rubber to the road.

636
01:08:58,468 --> 01:09:00,050
Maybe 15 minutes away.

637
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:01,718
No lights, no sirens!

638
01:09:06,851 --> 01:09:10,852
If this thing hits the Nine
we're going to take it by surprise.

639
01:09:10,938 --> 01:09:13,305
You and Brady, you come in from the east.

640
01:09:14,108 --> 01:09:18,352
Miller, you and Jenkins see if you can
find a road that gets you in front of it.

641
01:09:23,493 --> 01:09:26,657
The point is to stay alive.

642
01:09:29,248 --> 01:09:30,705
It's what your old man would've wanted.

643
01:09:41,928 --> 01:09:44,409
You find Addy and the two of
you get the hell out of here

644
01:09:44,490 --> 01:09:46,051
and don't come back
until I tell you different.

645
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:49,140
So you're just okay now?

646
01:09:49,227 --> 01:09:52,682
I just saw you rolling around on the ground
like you were having a brain scramble.

647
01:09:52,772 --> 01:09:54,308
I can drive, Danny.

648
01:09:55,233 --> 01:09:56,349
Danny!

649
01:09:57,068 --> 01:10:00,186
Danny, goddammit,
move over and let me in there!

650
01:10:00,988 --> 01:10:02,650
I got no idea!

651
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:05,608
Sheriff's up in Kissell, says they
can't even get a man down here.

652
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:09,028
Bud is really scaring me.

653
01:10:09,122 --> 01:10:12,118
He's in some kind of shock or something
and he's not snapping out of it.

654
01:10:13,126 --> 01:10:15,539
- I'm getting ready to run him...
- I let her go.

655
01:10:20,758 --> 01:10:21,874
I let her go.

656
01:10:26,639 --> 01:10:28,255
I couldn't hold on, Dad.

657
01:10:30,184 --> 01:10:32,426
I let her go and now she's out there
with that thing somewhere!

658
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:34,227
Now just... sit.

659
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:37,147
I left her out there!

660
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:39,441
Sit down.

661
01:10:39,527 --> 01:10:40,813
I left her, dad!

662
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:43,520
Sit down and stop, stop talking.

663
01:10:51,289 --> 01:10:53,281
All I know is that the truck
looks like it's been rolled.

664
01:10:53,374 --> 01:10:54,205
It's missing a goddamn...

665
01:10:54,292 --> 01:10:56,079
Jesus Christ!

666
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:00,078
Bud!

667
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:16,015
It's not about what I saw.

668
01:11:19,901 --> 01:11:21,984
If I even knew what that was...

669
01:11:25,865 --> 01:11:27,822
It's just how much bigger it is.

670
01:11:33,456 --> 01:11:34,663
How much older.

671
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:42,663
It's ancient.

672
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:54,682
Talk to me Jenkins, please.

673
01:11:54,769 --> 01:11:56,010
Nothing!

674
01:11:56,103 --> 01:11:57,344
Goddamn, nothing!

675
01:12:14,247 --> 01:12:16,113
Holy Mary, mother of God.

676
01:12:16,749 --> 01:12:18,160
You son of a bitch.

677
01:12:22,463 --> 01:12:23,704
Be straight with me.

678
01:12:23,798 --> 01:12:25,255
Can we kill this thing?

679
01:12:27,468 --> 01:12:28,800
You still a sharpshooter?

680
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:33,217
You bet your sweet ass I am.

681
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:34,847
Hang on!

682
01:12:36,519 --> 01:12:38,852
Get me up closer to that son of a bitch!

683
01:12:40,481 --> 01:12:41,642
Take his tire out!

684
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:53,150
Hit him again!

685
01:12:57,582 --> 01:12:59,164
What the hell are they made of?

686
01:13:01,919 --> 01:13:03,000
Again!

687
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:10,296
Son of a bitch!

688
01:13:15,975 --> 01:13:16,806
- Hold on!
- Jesus!

689
01:13:25,318 --> 01:13:26,274
What the hell?

690
01:13:48,215 --> 01:13:49,080
Mikey?

691
01:13:57,183 --> 01:13:59,891
Oh, come here you big ugly bastard.

692
01:13:59,977 --> 01:14:01,934
- Oh, my sweet...
- Christ!

693
01:14:02,021 --> 01:14:03,933
Everything ricochets off that truck!

694
01:14:05,066 --> 01:14:06,056
Mikey come in!

695
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:07,311
Mikey, listen to me!

696
01:14:07,401 --> 01:14:09,267
That truck is not to be fired on!

697
01:14:09,362 --> 01:14:10,603
Straight at it, Jenky!

698
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:11,732
Go!

699
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:19,156
Mikey, come in!

700
01:14:20,331 --> 01:14:23,915
Michael, don't shoot at the goddamn truck!

701
01:14:24,001 --> 01:14:24,866
<i>Mikey!</i>

702
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:27,581
Do you read me!

703
01:14:27,672 --> 01:14:29,288
<i>Mike, Mike come in!</i>

704
01:14:34,512 --> 01:14:35,548
Mikey, come in!

705
01:14:39,934 --> 01:14:41,391
<i>Michael, pick up!</i>

706
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:43,264
<i>Mikey, do you read me?</i>

707
01:14:43,354 --> 01:14:45,562
Don't shoot at that goddamn truck!

708
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:49,858
For my old man and a thousand others,
you ugly motherfucker!

709
01:15:15,845 --> 01:15:16,756
Hold on!

710
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:19,842
Put your belt on!

711
01:15:55,301 --> 01:15:56,257
Danny?

712
01:16:20,618 --> 01:16:21,574
Danny!

713
01:16:24,789 --> 01:16:25,950
Gah, Danny!

714
01:16:42,223 --> 01:16:42,963
Take this!

715
01:16:45,476 --> 01:16:46,466
Son of a...

716
01:16:54,985 --> 01:16:55,850
Cover me.

717
01:16:59,323 --> 01:17:00,234
Davis!

718
01:17:03,410 --> 01:17:04,241
Get down!

719
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:10,824
Don't give him what he wants.

720
01:17:14,338 --> 01:17:15,704
Swallow your fear.

721
01:17:18,175 --> 01:17:19,291
Don't give it to him.

722
01:17:21,387 --> 01:17:25,172
You cover me as best you can,
and then you haul your ass out of here.

723
01:17:26,433 --> 01:17:29,016
It can't get both of us if we split up.

724
01:17:29,103 --> 01:17:30,310
Split up?

725
01:17:31,272 --> 01:17:33,264
We both gotta take him, Danny!

726
01:17:34,191 --> 01:17:35,432
We need the firepower!

727
01:18:41,967 --> 01:18:42,798
<i>Hey!</i>

728
01:18:43,469 --> 01:18:44,710
<i>Hey, you!</i>

729
01:19:08,369 --> 01:19:09,530
Davis!

730
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:10,736
Get the hell out of here!

731
01:19:10,829 --> 01:19:11,660
Move!

732
01:22:45,252 --> 01:22:48,996
Whatever you think you can do, you can't.

733
01:22:50,799 --> 01:22:53,507
You're not going to stop me...

734
01:22:54,887 --> 01:22:56,628
So go away.

735
01:22:56,722 --> 01:22:57,678
They took her, mom.

736
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:00,051
It's got Addison now.

737
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:05,516
What?

738
01:23:40,557 --> 01:23:41,718
Where's Addy?

739
01:27:37,919 --> 01:27:41,087
<i>You have reached the Tri-County
Sheriff's Department, servicing Bannon,</i>

740
01:27:41,173 --> 01:27:43,290
<i>Kirtulla, and Poho Counties.</i>

741
01:27:43,383 --> 01:27:45,841
<i>This line is for emergency calls only.</i>

742
01:27:45,927 --> 01:27:48,670
<i>If this is an emergency,
please hold the line.</i>

743
01:30:12,115 --> 01:30:13,322
<i>Addy?</i>

744
01:30:44,272 --> 01:30:47,936
<i>Every 23rd Spring, for 23 days,</i>

745
01:30:48,026 --> 01:30:49,358
<i>it gets to eat.</i>

746
01:30:51,112 --> 01:30:52,398
<i>That's what we know.</i>

747
01:30:55,116 --> 01:30:57,233
<i>And the terrible things
it leaves in its wake...</i>

748
01:31:00,413 --> 01:31:02,154
<i>missing fathers and mothers.</i>

749
01:31:04,668 --> 01:31:10,585
<i>Brothers, sisters, daughters and sons.</i>

750
01:31:13,301 --> 01:31:14,792
<i>We know that, too.</i>

751
01:31:20,016 --> 01:31:22,259
<i>The creature reshapes our minds</i>

752
01:31:24,140 --> 01:31:26,625
<i>and changes the course of our lives.</i>

753
01:32:03,643 --> 01:32:04,804
What are you doing here?

754
01:32:05,645 --> 01:32:06,852
They're picking me up here.

755
01:32:06,938 --> 01:32:08,179
I didn't miss 'em, did I?

756
01:32:10,191 --> 01:32:11,727
They're picking you up here?

757
01:32:11,818 --> 01:32:12,979
So I could say goodbye.

758
01:32:13,945 --> 01:32:15,652
They don't care, it's on the way.

759
01:32:17,907 --> 01:32:19,614
Really, are you doing okay?

760
01:32:21,619 --> 01:32:23,076
I'm out of the house.

761
01:32:23,163 --> 01:32:24,904
Out in the sunshine.

762
01:32:24,998 --> 01:32:26,785
And back with your old boyfriend, huh?

763
01:32:32,130 --> 01:32:34,122
They say he's gone, you know.

764
01:32:34,215 --> 01:32:35,331
Do you really believe it?

765
01:32:36,217 --> 01:32:38,174
Gone for another 23 years?

766
01:32:38,261 --> 01:32:40,298
Think we'll still be around here to find out?

767
01:32:53,359 --> 01:32:54,895
I'm going to worry about you.

768
01:32:55,820 --> 01:32:57,311
I can't believe they're letting you go.

769
01:32:57,405 --> 01:32:59,067
For the last time we made it to state,

770
01:32:59,157 --> 01:33:00,819
I don't think the armageddon
will keep us from going.

771
01:33:00,909 --> 01:33:02,070
Is that your dad talking?

772
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:04,493
Oh, I got family up in Bollander.

773
01:33:04,579 --> 01:33:06,161
I might stay an extra day.

774
01:33:06,247 --> 01:33:07,363
I'm gonna miss you.

775
01:33:07,457 --> 01:33:10,120
Well, I'll miss you more, I bet.

776
01:33:11,669 --> 01:33:12,955
Keep an eye on my truck for me.

777
01:33:48,915 --> 01:33:53,594
<i>At the end of those 23 days, in an open
field by a broken-down school bus,</i>

778
01:33:55,375 --> 01:34:00,001
it once again ran out of time at
the rusty tip of a homemade harpoon.

779
01:34:00,593 --> 01:34:02,505
But most of you know this already.

780
01:34:03,596 --> 01:34:06,964
But I record these words as a testament.

781
01:34:08,226 --> 01:34:11,765
This 23rd Spring is a call to arms.

782
01:34:11,855 --> 01:34:15,064
We will not fail, and we will not fear.

783
01:34:17,902 --> 01:34:20,917
My name is Trisha Jenner,

784
01:34:21,598 --> 01:34:24,255
and this time when it comes,

785
01:34:24,656 --> 01:34:27,936
I will destroy the thing
that killed my brother.

786
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,161
So...

787
01:34:34,711 --> 01:34:37,078
come and get me you son of a bitch.
