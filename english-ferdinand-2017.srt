Oh!

500
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,111
Oh, sorry about that.
So sorry. So sorry.

501
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,394
Here you go. Here you go.

502
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,677

You could have ki...

503
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,034

You're ginormous!

507
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,712
There's been a huge
misunderstanding.

508

I really need your help here.

509

You want my help?

for this moment

513
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,830
my whole flea-bitten,
tin-chewing life, mister!

514
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,920
You have?

515
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,797
Oh, yes, I have!

No...

521
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,360
My true destiny
is to be a coach.

522
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,520
Okay...

523
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,148
Whoo! Look at those pecs.

524
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,677
It's like two little
baby bulls inside of a bull.

525

A-plus on the flank.

That's why you're here, right?

533
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,269

to get back home.

534

and my coaching expertise...

542

You think I ate a baby?

543
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,718
Not denying it. Interesting.

544
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,275
Denying it!

Let me introduce you
to the new guy.

557
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,999
He's a monster
and I'm his coach.

558
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,349
And did I mention

559
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,035
that he is my closest
and dearest BFF...

560
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,474
What did you say
your name was?

561
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,551
Ferdinand? Is that you?

562
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,439
Hey!
That is a ridiculous name.

563
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,079
Tell him your real name,
killer.

564
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,071
Yeah, it's me, Ferdinand.

You've had a growth spurt.

Suddenly I regret every time
I called you weirdo.

Oh. Didn't see you there,
Bones.

603

see me? Oh, I get it.

tail between your legs...

610
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,193
I never thought
I'd see you back here.

611
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,719
That makes two of us.

612

Nah, I get it.

613
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,071
Now that
you're a big tough guy,

614
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,593
you think you're better
than me.

What?
Correction, Valerie.
