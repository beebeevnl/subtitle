Kim!

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,400
Take my hand!

18
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,860

Grab my hand!

Come on!

20
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,190
Reach out your hand!

00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,020
Hurry!

22
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,440

It's on fire!

23
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,320
Take my hand!

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,520
No!

25

26

We made it,
we're alive!

00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:49,900
It's okay, sweetie.

00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,770
Hey! Get over here!

31
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,070
That was close!

32
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,650
That could've ended badly!

33
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,940
Little lady,
what's your name?

34
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,610
Kim Ja-Hong!

35
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,940
That's my name, cutie.

36
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,860
How did you know my name?

37
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,770
What's yours?

38
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:19,900
Your name...

39
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,650
Kim Ja-Hong!

40
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,110
Kim Ja-Hong!

41
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,610
You there!

42
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,820
Get out of there!
It's dangerous!

43
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,650
Get a stretcher!
Hurry the hell up!

44
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,270
Ja-Hong!

45
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,650
Mr. Kim Ja-Hong!

46
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:17,860
Wow!

47
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,940
How the hell did you think
to jump from there?

48
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:26,940
You fell from such height,
and honorably saved a girl...

49
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,770
A paragon!

50
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:32,320
The last honorable death
was 422 years ago.

51
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,730
I am honored,
Mr. Kim Ja-Hong!

52
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,980
The last one was
Nongae in 1592.

53
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:38,690
He's a paragon?

54
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:46,110
You passed away on
April 28, 2017 as scheduled.

55
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,570
We are the 3 guardians
of the Afterlife

56
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:54,480
who will defend you
through 7 trials over 49 days.

57
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:58,110
I'm a security specialist,
Deputy Guardian Hewonmak.

58
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,690
I am Assistant Guardian
Deok-choon.

59
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:02,860
It's good to meet you!

60
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,230
It's an honor, sir!

61
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,110
We said 3 guardians,
so why are there only 2?

62
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,730
It's an obvious question.

63
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,150
The last guardian is...

64
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,440
at your funeral home.

65
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,690
It's protocol,
but I think he went for food.

66
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,020
He's a strange one,
don't you think?

67
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,190
Mr. Kim?
What's up?

68
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:26,440
Everything's fine,
you're a death virgin.

69
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,020
That's why it's confusing
and awkward.

70
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,110
No...

71
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,730
I can't die just yet.

72
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,320
My mother...

73
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,270
I can't leave my mother!

74
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,770
Afterlife Law, Article 3.1!

75
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,940
One cannot wander the living world,
and there's no time for farewells!

76
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,730
If you plead the Fifth,
you'll be at a disadvantage...

77
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:51,820
He's following the protocol
like a real paragon.

78
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,570
Good, keep going!

79
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:57,190
Up! Up!

80
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,610
Let me see my mother
one last time, please!

81
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,320
I have something to tell her!

82
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,230
Love for his mother...

83
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,900
Please, I'm begging you!

84
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,770
One last time!

85
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,360
Please!

86
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,570
This is bad even for me.

87
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:50,690
Casketing for Kim Ja-Hong
will begin shortly.

88
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:56,770
Once again, casketing for
Kim Ja-Hong will begin shortly.

89
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,400
Mom.

90
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,610
Mom?

91
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,730
Snap out of it, Mom.

92
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,440
He's ready, let's go.

93
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:17,150
Mom, we should go!

(GATE OF THE AFTERLIFE)

95
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,070
Salute!

96

That's King Yeomra.

97
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:54,270
The judge of the Hell of Filial Impiety,
and the king of kings.

98
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,770
And he's Guardian Gang-lim.

99
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,320
The leader and our boss.

100
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,480
He's reincarnated 47 souls
in the past century.

101
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:08,610
- Paragon Kim, it's nice to meet you.
- Make way for the paragon!

102
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,230
I'm not a paragon.

103
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,150
Over here!

104
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:16,770
Here! Here!

105
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,400
Let him through.
Make way.

106
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,400
- Mr. Kim, please hurry!
- Make way.

107

Incredible! He's the one!

109
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:46,230
Mr. Kim, you really are
an honorable paragon!

110
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,020
It's been 19 years!

111
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:52,230
Your chance for reincarnation
after 49 days is very high!

112
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:55,270
An honorable soul!
Paragon Kim Ja-Hong!

(VOLCANO OF THE DAMNED)

114
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,400
Why the hell is
the Hell of Murder our first stop?

115
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,940
The Hell of Murder! The Volcano!

116
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,860
You said he was a paragon.

117
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,110
Did you really kill someone?

118
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:25,730
What?

119
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,940
I didn't kill anyone.

120
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,690
There are a total
of 7 trials:

121
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:35,770
betrayal, violence, filial impiety,
murder, indolence, deceit, injustice.

122
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:39,570
The order of the trials is determined
by King Yeomra himself,

123
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:43,020
who judges your sins
from lightest to heaviest.

124
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:46,020
Other than Yeomra,

125
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:48,730
no one knows the order
of your trials.

126
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:52,570
Murder? I've never
harmed anyone.

127
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,230
This trial will also
look at indirect murders.

128
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:58,480
If your past actions
influenced someone's death,

129
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,480
that is enough cause
to be charged.

130
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,650
So don't post mean
comments online hastily!

131
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:04,820
It's all recorded!

132
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,400
No need to worry,
guess what she's doing.

133
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,770
Our baby has a special power.

134
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,900
She's scanning
a list of all your charges

135
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,190
in order to defend you better.

136
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,270
It may seem like a skill
but it's like karma.

137
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,690
It must be taxing on her.

138
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,520
Who did he kill?

139
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,610
No!

140
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,730

00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:25,150
Give me your hand!

143
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,900
Just a little more!

144
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,070
I got you!

145
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,110
Climb!

146
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,770
You insolent prick!

147
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,070
How dare you!

148
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,150
(GOD OF MURDER)

149
00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:00,730
This trial is about leaving
a doomed colleague behind.

150
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,520
Despite having enough time,

151
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:07,110
Kim's desire for his own safety
and his indecisiveness

152
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:10,940
ultimately caused his colleague's death.

153
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:19,900
If he'd acted in time,
the victim could've survived,

154
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:25,610
therefore, this could be
seen as an indirect murder!

155
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,690
This indirect murder was

156
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:37,900
a direct result of
his willful negligence,

157
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,980
and he must suffer
in the volcano

158
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:46,070
for 50 years...

159
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:47,730
5 years!

160
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,570
You can't demand
50 years from a paragon!

161
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,730
He's a paragon!

162
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,570
Be respectful
with your demands!

163
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,860
We demand a punishment

164
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:01,610
of 5 years that feels like 50!

165
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,270
Because he's a paragon!

166
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,820
Guardians, begin your defense!

167
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,070
I'd first like to question the defendant.

168
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,400
Do you remember your
colleague's last words?

169
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,150
Hello?!

170
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,020
- Listen.
- Help!

171
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,360
Help the injured first.

172
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,400
It'll be safer
if you control the fire.

173
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:39,480
Puncture the outer wall
and lift this with a pulley.

174
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:40,730
Got it?

175
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,730
It might cave in,
get going!

176
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,150
Get out!

177
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,820
Go on!

178
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,480
I'll be back shortly.

179
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,730
Stay right here!

180
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:53,820
That's all I can do.

181
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,360
I'll be right here.

182
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,230
Here, take this.

183
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,690
You'll need it!

184
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,150
Go! Go on!

185
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:20,690
Kim Ja-Hong,
raise your head.

186
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,320
You're not guilty yet.

187
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,980
Raise your head, Mr. Kim.

188
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:33,070
One more question.

189
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,610
During the fire that day,

190
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:40,730
you followed his order
and couldn't save him.

191
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,570
But how many others
did you save?

192
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:47,860
6...

193
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,190
7?

194
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,150
I'm not sure,
I can't remember...

195
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,480
Please pay attention
to the Mirror of Karma.

196
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,270
May I borrow this?

197
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,730
As you can see,

198
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:22,360
his memory may be foggy,
but he saved exactly 8 lives

199
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,860
from the vicious inferno.

200
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:29,570
He was on the nightly news
for his heroism.

201
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,480
Let me ask you this.

202
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,940
The defendant saved
8 total strangers,

203
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,730
but in order to do so,
he couldn't save his colleague.

204
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:41,020
How, then, are these lives
weighed differently?

205
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:44,110
I await your answer.

206
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,480
Such nonsense
on the first trial?

207
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:56,730
How do you weigh lives?
They're not even tangible.

208
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:03,770
If something invisible
has weight, they're all the same...

209
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,520
Honorable God of Murder,

210
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:25,440
please take into consideration
the prosecutor's last statement

211
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,860
as you weigh in on
Honorable Kim's charges.

212
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,150
It's too dangerous!
Get back!

213
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,400
Don't go!

214
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,480
No! No!

215
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:45,150
My daughter...

216
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:50,520
Ji-yeon, my baby!

217
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:19,570
Here is my final verdict!

218
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,070
The defendant's decision

219
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:28,110
to save many lives instead of
his colleague's is paradoxical,

220
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:33,020
but his death breathed
life to many!

221
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:37,520
His indirect murder charge
is thus rejected.

222
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:44,110
This court finds
Honorable Kim innocent,

223
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:48,480
as his murder charge
is completely without merit.

224
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,820
(RIVER OF INDOLENCE)

225
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:00,820
Mr. Kim.

226
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:06,940
The next trial determines
how well you lived your life.

227
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,110
Whether you lived it to the fullest...

228
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,230
Guardian Gang-lim!

229
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,860
It's like we hit a jackpot!

230
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,570
Finished scanning already?

231
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,360
There is no arraignment at all,

232
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,150
and he just has to step in
and say how hard he lived.

233
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:31,320
We were even assigned
the shittiest prosecutors.

234
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,730
This'll ensure Kim a smooth ride!

235
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,270
Do not underestimate
the prosecutors.

236
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,650
Starting off with a loss,
they'll be armed to the teeth.

237
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:44,400
If they indict a paragon,
they'll get promoted.

238
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,270
What's in it for you all?

239
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:53,120
Why are you trying to
save someone like me?

240
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,770
Don't be so cynical.

241
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:58,230
Reincarnation is good for you.

242
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,520
But I don't want
to be reincarnated.

243
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:02,190
Mr. Kim, that's for
the Afterlife to decide.

244
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:03,770
It's a century-old promise.

245
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,480
A promise with King Yeomra.

246
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:15,020
If we help reincarnate
49 souls over a century,

247
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:17,070
he'll reincarnate us as well.

248
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,690
As whatever we want!

249
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:21,900
I've already decided to be
the son of a Fortune 500 CEO.

250
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:24,610
Anything else is more hellish
than hell in Korea.

251
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:34,320
However, that's only possible
by defending paragons like you.

252
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:40,110
For a normal soul to pass
all trials in 49 days

253
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:42,230
is next to impossible.

254
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,420
Be our 48th reincarnation,

255
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,740
I beg of you.

256
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:51,120
What if I wasn't a paragon?

257
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:52,950
What would you do then?

258
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:59,160
Let me stress again,
that's for the Afterlife to decide.

259
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:19,030
Don't look at it!

260
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:21,570
No eye contact!

261
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:24,980
They see people's eyes
and prey on them.

262
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:28,570
They come after
souls that look at them.

263
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:30,860
They'll tear you up.

264
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:33,570
Mr. Kim.

265
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,820
Think of the Hell of Indolence
as a tourist stop,

266
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:40,110
but remember one thing.

267
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:46,650
Do not talk back to
the Goddess of Indolence.

268
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:49,230
No exceptions.

269
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,480
Your feet.

270
00:21:58,770 --> 00:21:59,770
Grab it!

271
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:02,610
There, grab it!

272
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:14,610
Article 2.3
defines Indolence as

273
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:15,940
(HELL OF INDOLENCE)

274
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:20,190
wasting away a noble life
given to the subject,

275
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,820
with endless idling
and negligence.

276
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:29,270
But as you see,
indolence and laziness

277
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,110
are inconceivable
to Kim Ja-Hong.

278
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:35,940
I present his life to you,
Honorable Goddess.

279
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,890
(GODDESS OF INDOLENCE)

280
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:42,140
Be careful!
Almost there!

281
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,770
So close!

282
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:49,770
Good! So close!
Grab it!

283
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:52,520
Eh? A bee!

284
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,810
A bee!

285
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:24,180
His passion for saving lives

286
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:28,100
wasn't limited to just humans!

287
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:38,470
Amazing! Incredible!

288
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,180
His affectionate gestures
reached out

289
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:46,810
to even the smallest
and weakest organisms.

290
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:49,140
Everything he touched

291
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:56,520
was filled with glimpses of
sacrifice and salvation.

292
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,970
Don't look at me,
look at Navi!

293
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,100
She's over there,
get her, now!

294
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:03,520
Talk to her,
convince her to come.

295
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,390
Oh gosh!

296
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:10,220
His vocational ethics
that know no boundaries

297
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:16,600
often put him into
dangerous situations...

298
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:28,020
Lamborghini!

299
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,560
You're not at fault,
Kim Ja-Hong!

300
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,600
We understand you,
Kim Ja-Hong!

301
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,270
How could anyone
fault him for anything?

302
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:37,560
Your Honorable Goddess.

303
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:41,640
Those guardians,

304
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:48,220
they're patronizing your court
by turning it into a show and tell.

305
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:49,140
Hold him in contempt...

306
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,020
Enough!

307
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,390
Forget it,
it's all settled.

308
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:58,020
Let's erect his statue here.

309
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,020
Raise it!

310
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,810
If not for someone like him,
then for whom? Right?

311
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,100
Let's erect one!

312
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,720
Of course, Your Highness.

313
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:10,430
While we're at it, make it a big one,
order an extra large statue.

314
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,560
Good, something big.

315
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,770
What compelled you

316
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:29,270
to throw yourself in the face
of danger to save others?

317
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:35,680
Or did you want to live
each day to the fullest?

318
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,140
It was all for money.

319
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,270
Say what?

320
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,930
Did I hear you say money?

321
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:51,430
Cash?

322
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,640
Money?

323
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,180
Yes, I...

324
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,270
had to make money.

325
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,310
Mr. Kim!

326
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,310
Your Highness,

327
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:08,140
we'll start the lift.

328
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:10,430
Sure, go on.

329
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,100
Okay.

330
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,680
Was money your god?

331
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,310
You served a terrible god.

332
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:27,140
I'll make you feel sorry
for choosing the money god.

333
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,810
Hewonmak!
Go save him!

334
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:15,220
He's gonna fall!

335
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,180
Merciful Goddess!

336
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,390
I beg of you to look at
the Mirror of Karma!

337
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:25,310
What do you think
you're doing?!

338
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,890
He worshipped the wrong god!

339
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:29,810
Yes, he did.

340
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,180
And for that reason,

341
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:36,100
he extinguished fire during the day
and lit one at night.

342
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,270
Get him charcoal fire!

343
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:39,930
Sure!

344
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,380
Watch out!
Fire coming through.

345
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:45,430
Due to utter poverty,

346
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:48,560
Kim delivered veggies
on his off days

347
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,820
and cleaned sauna floors
on the weekends.

348
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:53,810
And when that was over,

349
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:57,560
he was forced to work
as a temp driver.

350
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:09,100
Ja-Hong!

351
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:09,970
You bastard!

352
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,720
Drive straight!

353
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,680
Even on days off?

354
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,890
Then when did he get any rest?

355
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,770
His true day off

356
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,560
was the day after his death.

357
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:33,180
He did not rest for a moment
when he was alive.

358
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:36,770
His ailing mother
required treatment,

359
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:41,020
and his brother's law school
wasn't cheap!

360
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:46,600
Without Kim's money,
they wouldn't have survived!

361
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:50,970
Money was everything to him!

362
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:56,680
He was only able to sever
the reach of this god by dying!

363
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:59,770
I beg of you
to embrace this soul,

364
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:04,020
a soul that only looked after
his poverty-stricken family!

365
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,980
Thank you.

366
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,160
Good afternoon.

367
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:16,970
My verdict is as follows.

368
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:25,270
The defendant's reason for
not being indolent

369
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:30,350
was said to be the accumulation
of money and goods,

370
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:35,350
which were not for
his own selfish interest,

371
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:41,600
but to support his ailing mother
and his younger brother.

372
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:47,100
(BLADE FOREST)
Therefore, I find the defendant not guilty.

373
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:55,770
The Hell of Deceit judges the lies
one has said in one's life.

374
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:59,140
The branches are razor sharp,
hence the name Blade Forest.

375
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:02,180
The reflection of the moon
on the blades...

376
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:04,770
is quite beautiful, right?

377
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:07,140
But if you touch anything
out of your curiosity...

378
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,720
If you did
out of curiosity,

379
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:21,930
the blades will slice you open
and you'll feel incredible pain.

380
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:24,850
I begged you not to
talk back to the Goddess.

381
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,850
You broke my promise again.

382
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,390
I won't be making
any more of those.

383
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:31,680
It'll be orders from here on.

384
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,870
Free him!

385
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:37,850
Why are you so rebellious?

386
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,140
It'd be nice if you'd do
what you're told.

387
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:45,060
We'd get a 48th paragon,
and you'd get a reincarnation.

388
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:49,970
And you'd get a dream visitation
before reincarnation.

389
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:53,310
You could appear
in your mom's dream.

390
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:56,430
Please hold on,
it'll heal shortly.

391
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,520
What did you say?

392
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,100
Wounds heal faster in the Afterlife...

393
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:04,140
No, the dream visitation?

394
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,600
You don't know?
Appearing in dreams.

395
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,640
It's a privilege given to those
who receive reincarnation.

396
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,470
Really? I can meet my mother?

397
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,680
I thought we told you.

398
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:22,520
Before you reincarnate,
you're allowed to see anyone

399
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,520
to say farewell one last time...

400
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:28,060
People who say they met their
dead father in a dream,

401
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,100
that's what this is.

402
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:36,810
What's with him?

403
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,140
Mother!

404
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,680
Mother!

405
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,180
Yes, Ja-Hong,
it's me, your mother.

406
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,470
Mother...

407
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,270
- Should I stay in character?
- Sure, sure.

408
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,680
Mother...

409
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:57,390
Damn.

410
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:00,970
This place feels eerie,
even after a century.

411
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,850
We could just walk...

412
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:08,430
Kiddo, explain this to him
so he doesn't screw us up again.

413
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:12,970
Think of this as
a special treat for the paragon.

414
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:16,390
It's a fast transportation system
to pass through this area.

415
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:24,850
What's he up to?

416
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,600
Let's get going.

417
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,430
A hell ghoul?
What's it doing here?!

418
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,520
Dammit...

419
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,100
Even time is speeding up!

420
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,220
From the living world...

421
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:10,140
Is it a vengeful spirit?

422
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:13,850
You got any more immediate family
in the living world?

423
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:34,560
Drastic changes
in the Afterlife

424
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,600
mean that your family member
has become a vengeful spirit.

425
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,720
I don't understand...

426
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:43,350
Sir!

427
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:46,520
The head!

428
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:52,930
Get rid of it!

429
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:05,560
Captain! Pull yourself up!

430
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:26,310
Cap, you okay?

431
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:27,850
- There!
- What?

432
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:29,470
Smash it!

433
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,600
Smash the column!

434
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:34,270
Hurry! Please!

435
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:22,290
Don't you understand?

436
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:24,680
It's either your mother or brother!

437
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,970
Somebody has died
with a grudge!

438
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:30,270
And they've become a vengeful spirit!

439
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:35,560
With that roaming the living world,
the Afterlife has gone to shit!

440
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,600
Mother...

441
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:42,850
Mommy!

442
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,890
Deok-choon,
put a blindfold on him.

443
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:53,470
Mother...

444
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:55,600
Could something have
happened to her?

445
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,310
We're not sure,
but I doubt that.

446
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:00,350
Please, I need a firm answer!

447
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:01,720
Is she alright?

448
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:02,930
You want a firm answer?

449
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,180
Whether it's your trial or not,

450
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:08,430
if hell ghouls are wreaking havoc
and time has speed up,

451
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:15,310
at this rate we'll never reach
the final trial in 49 days.

452
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,560
- Deok-choon!
- Guardian Lee Deok-choon, here!

453
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:31,810
Deok-choon.

454
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:35,810
I'm gonna take a detour,
so take over for a bit.

455
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:39,390
He's a paragon, so there won't
be any victims.

456
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,470
If there's a problem,

457
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,930
stall the trial until I signal.

458
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:47,560
I'm counting on you.

459
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,470
Don't forget that
you and I are linked.

460
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,680
Don't worry, cap.

461
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:53,350
I'm here.

462
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:55,390
No, I don't want you to think.

463
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,060
Do me a favor.

464
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,560
Whenever you get an idea,

465
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:02,060
make sure to doubt it
before acting on it.

466
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:05,100
If it's good,
then verify with her.

467
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,680
Correct him instantly.

468
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,350
Easy, eh?
It should be.

469
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:14,720
So aside from protecting Kim,
I don't want you to think.

470
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,720
It's my sincere hope.

471
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,100
Okay?

472
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,270
Good.

473
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:58,140
(ITEMS OF THE DECEASED
Accepted by: Kim Su-Hong, brother)

474
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:13,430
These are Ja-hong's
personal items.

475
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:24,970
Mom!

476
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:31,520
Why are you taking that?

477
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,350
It's dead!
Throw it away!

478
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:43,930
My mother is a mute.

479
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,180
She can't talk.

480
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:51,560
I've never heard her voice
since I was born.

481
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:44,770
Just wait 2 weeks.

482
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:48,470
After my discharge,
I'll always stay with you.

483
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:56,140
Kim Ja-Hong, that bastard!

484
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:13,350
(Who are you?)

485
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,810
My deepest condolences, ma'am.

486
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,470
Mr. Kim saved my life,

487
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:38,640
and I was given a new life
because of him.

488
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:48,640
I saw the news on TV
and came right away.

489
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,890
I wanted to say farewell...

490
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:16,560
I haven't had a chance
to say goodbye.

491
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:22,220
If it's not too much trouble,

492
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:25,390
may I do so privately?

493
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,890
Thank you, ma'am.

494
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:42,510
Kim Su-Hong.

495
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,930
Where is the place
of your death?

496
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:03,270
I must be close to my death.

497
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,310
I can see the Grim Reaper.

498
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:10,100
Don't say that!

499
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:14,810
You're not gonna die,
Grandpa!

500
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:31,890
Look at the sky.

501
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,390
Is this the Afterlife
or a club?

502
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:36,140
How does time
pass so quickly?

503
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:44,810
No tickling.

504
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,770
Excuse me.

505
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:50,350
Any news of my mother?

506
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:51,600
No tickling.

507
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:55,430
Excuse me? Wake up!

508
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:59,220
Don't disturb her,
she's not taking a nap!

509
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:02,770
She's looking up
the next trial's charges!

510
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:05,270
You really don't get it.
Are you dumb?

511
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:07,640
Why did you take that off?
Put it back on!

512
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:15,060
Forget it,
it's too late.

513
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,390
Get up,
wake her up too.

514
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,430
- Open your eyes!
- Hurry, come on.

515
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:24,430
Is it over?

516
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:26,810
Yeah, over for us.

517
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,930
It's King Yeomra!

518
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:21,520
Bow, bow!

519
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:22,890
Bow your head!

520
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:30,270
He's already dead,
but does he wish to die again?

521
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:34,270
He's the first paragon
in 19 years, Your Majesty!

522
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:40,220
And why does
our honorable guest

523
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:43,270
bring forth hell ghouls
and disturb my realm?

524
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:46,060
Guardian Gang-lim has
gone down to investigate.

525
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:49,430
He's going as fast as he can,
Your Majesty.

526
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:51,680
How will he calm the spirit?

527
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:55,140
The body will be burned
and its soul eliminated,

528
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:58,270
but without disturbing
the order of the living world.

529
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:01,350
No!

530
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:04,350
No!

531
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:06,220
Hold.

532
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:07,560
No, you bastards!

533
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,060
- No!
- Stop!

534
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:11,470
- You can't do that!
- Please stop!

535
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:13,680
Stop!

536
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:17,140
Who the hell are you?
Answer me!

537
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:19,470
Don't you dare
touch my mother!

538
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,430
I'll beat the hell out of you!

539
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:22,520
- Get him off.
- I'm so sorry!

540
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,970
Who the hell are you?!

541
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:25,720
How dare you
eliminate my mother!

542
00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:27,310
Get him off of me.

543
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:30,520
Do you know her?!

544
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,220
- Don't pretend to be cool!
- I'm sorry!

545
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:35,180
My apologies,
Your Majesty!

546
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,600
Calm down!

547
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:42,470
Hold still!

548
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:43,810
Shut up!

549
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:45,470
Shut the hell up!

550
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:50,060
Please give us more time,
Honorable King!

551
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:58,180
Go tell Gang-lim,
that if he eliminates the...

552
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:00,470
Don't bullshit me!

553
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:04,060
What's with him?

554
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:07,180
Go tell Gang-lim!

555
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:10,720
If he doesn't eliminate
the vengeful spirit soon,

556
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:12,810
I'll go down to
the living world myself!

557
00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:15,100
Yes, Your Majesty!

558
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:18,720
My apologies!

559
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:20,020
What the hell are you?!

560
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:21,270
I'm so sorry!

561
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:31,560
Is it true that Sgt. Kim
deserted because of his brother?

562
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:32,100
I dunno...

563
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:32,850
Do you know anything?

564
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:35,020
- He deserted?
- It's been 3 days.

565
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:39,100
Why'd he desert
just before his discharge?

566
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:43,560
I feel so bad...

567
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:47,100
If it were me,
my guts would rot.

568
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:49,390
And full of fucking maggots.

569
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:12,720
I'll ask you again,
who was it?

570
00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:13,850
Sorry, sir!

571
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:16,350
Buddy, look at his face.

572
00:48:17,390 --> 00:48:20,770
I'll do the same to you
and go to military prison.

573
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:22,640
- I'm sorry!
- Sorry, sir!

574
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:24,640
He's on suicide watch!

575
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:30,770
Something over my heart!

576
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:32,140
Very nice!

577
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:36,600
A watch badge!

578
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,470
My lyrics are so good!

579
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,520
I wrote it for you, dude!

580
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,020
I love it, sir.

581
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:46,850
Dong-yeon,
get up, dude.

582
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:49,850
Sir, I can't walk any further.

583
00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:50,930
Of course you can.

584
00:48:52,270 --> 00:48:54,680
- Get up, come on.
- I'm so exhausted.

585
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,060
You can do this.

586
00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:05,600
It's not that,
I can't sleep at all.

587
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:08,810
So why can't you?

588
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:13,890
It feels like someone's
watching me at night,

589
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:17,430
and I get the chills...

590
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:21,100
Lieutenant! Salute!

591
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:25,350
An investigator's here
about Sgt. Kim's desertion.

592
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:27,100
Is that so?

593
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:29,140
They sent a Lt. Colonel.

594
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,680
- HQ investigator?
- Yes, sir.

595
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:40,390
(HELL OF DECEIT)

596
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:55,270
"Dad will always watch you
from somewhere nearby."

597
00:49:55,390 --> 00:50:01,600
"So study hard and become
a good person.

598
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:05,180
(GODDESS OF DECEIT)
If you're a good girl, over Christmas..."

599
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:06,390
What's that?

600
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:10,180
Kim wrote a letter
to the dead colleague's kid.

601
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:11,390
As her dad...

602
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:14,390
"We'll go to
Disney Land together.

603
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:15,930
I'm so sorry,

604
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:17,850
and I love you."

605
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:18,890
The dead man?

606
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:22,560
Isn't that the will, then?

607
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:24,720
That's forgery of
a private document!

608
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:29,350
"Don't get sick
and always be healthy."

609
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:35,850
This is just a sample
of the defendant's fake letters.

610
00:50:35,890 --> 00:50:39,390
Before this court validates
the nature of his crime,

611
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:46,140
I'd like you to pay attention
to the sheer number of letters.

612
00:50:52,270 --> 00:50:53,560
How many did he write?

613
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:54,890
98 letters!

614
00:50:55,640 --> 00:51:01,060
That's the number of letters
this "paragon"

615
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:04,310
sent under the pretense
of giving hope!

616
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:08,310
98? That many?

617
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:12,460
Why didn't he write 2 more
and make it 100?

618
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:14,190
Are you insane?!

619
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:26,140
Answer, defendant.

620
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:28,600
Your legal representative
asked you if you're insane.

621
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:34,220
My heart ached so much...

622
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:40,720
They were too young.

623
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,020
Much too young...

624
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:52,810
That was the only thing...

625
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,350
I could do for them...

626
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:36,770
- Salute!
- At ease.

627
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:42,220
I won't mince words,
let's cut to the chase.

628
00:52:42,970 --> 00:52:47,310
Sgt. Kim has deserted,
but his family doesn't know yet?

629
00:52:47,350 --> 00:52:49,560
It's only been a few weeks
since his brother died.

630
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:52,720
He could be hiding
in the barracks,

631
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:55,930
but more importantly,

632
00:52:55,970 --> 00:52:57,640
his mother could
go into shock...

633
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,240
Your compassion brings
tears to my eyes.

634
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,770
What's with the bullshit?

635
00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:10,270
Sgt. Kim was like
my own brother.

636
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:15,060
Unlike others his age,
he looked after his men,

637
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:18,640
and thanks to him
I received some commendation.

638
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:24,310
We will be contacting
his mother soon.

639
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,220
Where did you bury him?

640
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:31,930
Defendant, please answer.

641
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:35,560
Do you refuse to answer?

642
00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:39,470
Defendant!

643
00:53:39,970 --> 00:53:43,770
Her Majesty is asking you
whether you knew

644
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:47,890
about their pain and despair
upon discovering the truth!

645
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:49,770
Please answer!

646
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:55,390
She knew the letters were fake,
but she still waited every day,

647
00:53:55,430 --> 00:53:57,850
rain or shine,
day or night!

648
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,970
Is the defendant
refusing to testify?

649
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:07,350
You may think that silence
is the best defense,

650
00:54:07,390 --> 00:54:11,350
but I'll gladly cut off
your useless tongue.

651
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:23,020
Sir!

652
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,310
Cap! Cap!

653
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:27,560
Captain!

654
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:30,720
I'm a busy man.

655
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:33,390
For the last time,

656
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,350
where did you bury him?

657
00:54:39,770 --> 00:54:41,430
Please!

658
00:54:44,810 --> 00:54:50,350
I'll report you to the MP
for false information!

659
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:55,470
That's enough.

660
00:54:56,350 --> 00:54:57,470
No need for that.

661
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:01,270
Is Kim's last duty report correct?

662
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:04,850
Kim had night guard duty
with Pvt. Won Dong-yeon.

663
00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:14,220
I gave you a chance.

664
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:16,680
Watch your tongue later.

665
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,180
Assistant Guardian
Lee Deok-choon!

666
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,350
No! Not yet!

667
00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:26,930
Assistant Guardian
Lee Deok-choon!

668
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:28,390
Lee Deok-choon reporting!

669
00:55:28,850 --> 00:55:29,850
Initiate link.

670
00:55:33,810 --> 00:55:36,970
I'll now begin our final defense.

671
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:46,100
Hold on for a bit.

672
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:51,060
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

673
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:54,180
Defendant Kim Ja-Hong
is indeed a liar.

674
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:55,810
Is indeed a liar.

675
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:05,310
What you're seeing now

676
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:09,430
are not only fake letters
to Ji-yeon, who lost her dad,

677
00:56:09,470 --> 00:56:13,060
but also fake letters to his mother
for the past 15 years.

678
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:15,770
For the past 15 years.

679
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:20,520
What the heck?

680
00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:22,890
Shoo! Go away!

681
00:56:24,850 --> 00:56:27,390
Here he comes!

682
00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:30,720
Catch him!

683
00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:42,020
Mother, I injured my arm
while playing with my son.

684
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:47,470
He lied about a boar injury,
saying it was his son's playful trick.

685
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:50,310
My wife made scorched rice today.

686
00:56:50,350 --> 00:56:54,600
Fearing that his mother would
give up fighting her illness,

687
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:59,810
he breathed hope into her
by creating a wife.

688
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:02,350
Then what happened?

689
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,810
His mother overcame
her incurable illness,

690
00:57:05,850 --> 00:57:10,640
- made a full recovery!
- And now leads a fulfilling life!

691
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:15,560
Mom, try it.

692
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:17,430
Is it good?

693
00:57:17,470 --> 00:57:20,020
If she knew how he
braved death

694
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:25,720
to earn money and pay
for her hospital bills,

695
00:57:26,390 --> 00:57:29,770
I'd like to ask if her recovery
would've been possible.

696
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:31,680
But if she ever found out!

697
00:57:32,470 --> 00:57:36,930
That all those letters were lies,
imagine her despair,

698
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,970
and would that be treatable?!

699
00:57:40,310 --> 00:57:44,680
I'd like to add that
everyone grew with despair.

700
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:46,890
One last question.

701
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:51,850
Do you deny writing
all of these fake letters?

702
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:55,560
With the anticipation
and hope in those letters,

703
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:58,270
their sense of loss
would've been equally great.

704
00:57:58,430 --> 00:58:00,390
- But they!
- Those of the living!

705
00:58:00,770 --> 00:58:05,270
They grew up
as much as their loss.

706
00:58:07,310 --> 00:58:09,680
My dear Daddy!
Are you doing well?

707
00:58:10,310 --> 00:58:14,310
Your firefighter friends are
taking good care of us.

708
00:58:14,350 --> 00:58:16,810
I'm doing well in school...

709
00:58:16,850 --> 00:58:20,270
I can do laundry and
make dinner too.

710
00:58:20,310 --> 00:58:23,430
You may be away,
but you're always in my heart.

711
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:25,640
Watch over me forever.

712
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,640
Your jewel, Ji-yeon.

713
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:51,680
Prosecution,

714
00:58:52,930 --> 00:58:55,770
were there any
similar cases in the past?

715
00:58:55,810 --> 00:58:58,520
No, well...

716
00:58:58,560 --> 00:58:59,560
The Admiral!

717
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:02,970
Admiral Yi said
not to announce his death.

718
00:59:05,770 --> 00:59:08,140
To the enemy forces,
of course...

719
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:09,890
It was a strategic tactic...

720
00:59:09,930 --> 00:59:12,140
The Admiral said that
to his allies.

721
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:15,890
So that his men would keep
their morale high.

722
00:59:16,270 --> 00:59:17,350
This is why...

723
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:22,310
I ordered all paragons to
just pass through

724
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:23,930
without a trial, didn't I?

725
00:59:25,390 --> 00:59:30,430
In the case of defendant
Kim Ja-hong's fake letters,

726
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:33,180
this court will dismiss
all charges against him.

727
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:37,720
Any pieces of evidence
presented here today

728
00:59:37,770 --> 00:59:42,140
are removed, and all charges
are dropped immediately,

729
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:47,600
and he may proceed
to the next trial.

730
00:59:53,810 --> 00:59:57,430
And if you two aren't busy,
come with me.

731
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,810
Outside, now!

732
01:00:07,430 --> 01:00:10,100
I'm getting wrinkles
thanks to you...

733
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:12,970
Why are you so desperate
to see your mom?

734
01:00:13,470 --> 01:00:16,680
Let's hear why
you're a mama's boy.

735
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,100
Is there something
you want to tell her?

736
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:19,720
I've been curious too.

737
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:20,850
Read over the next charges.

738
01:00:24,930 --> 01:00:26,430
Electric rice cooker.

739
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:30,310
I bought a cooker
that makes scorched rice.

740
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:35,140
It smells so good!

741
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:38,310
I always had to
eat it as a kid.

742
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:42,520
Mother only made rice
with an old tin pot.

743
01:00:43,310 --> 01:00:45,310
But her memory's not
the same as before,

744
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:57,720
and she burned so many pots.

745
01:00:57,930 --> 01:00:58,930
Come on!

746
01:00:59,180 --> 01:00:59,720
Hot!

747
01:00:59,770 --> 01:01:01,770
So many pots were thrown away...

748
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:03,390
Mom, do you have dementia?!

749
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:07,350
Wow! Junk!

750
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:09,270
But you know what?

751
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:13,560
Electric cookers nowadays
can make scorched rice.

752
01:01:13,810 --> 01:01:15,140
It's a new model!

753
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:18,810
So I bought one as a gift
and left it in the storage.

754
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,310
I really want her
to have it.

755
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:22,680
Really?

756
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:27,680
Is the cooker the only thing
you want to give to her?

757
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:29,600
That is so stupid...

758
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:33,470
Or the letter inside?

759
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:37,180
You still had one left.

760
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:41,100
An unsent letter.

761
01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:42,560
Not a fake one,

762
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:46,520
but a real letter.

763
01:01:49,470 --> 01:01:50,470
Mr. Kim!

764
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,560
Your mother is alive and well.

765
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:03,600
Guardian Gang-lim, thank you!

766
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:06,680
Thank you so much!

767
01:02:07,430 --> 01:02:08,600
Su-Hong!

768
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,680
What about my brother?

769
01:02:12,810 --> 01:02:15,600
He's healthy and
doing well in the military.

770
01:02:16,430 --> 01:02:18,930
Thank you! Thank you!

771
01:02:18,970 --> 01:02:20,560
Thank you so much!

772
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:22,850
Sorry about that.

773
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:32,270
Listen up.

774
01:02:32,970 --> 01:02:35,310
His brother is dead and
became a vengeful spirit.

775
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:38,390
I'm looking into where
and how he died,

776
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:42,060
and I'll incinerate his body.

777
01:02:43,350 --> 01:02:47,310
So long as the spirit is out there,
Kim's trial will be in danger...

778
01:02:47,350 --> 01:02:49,100
You lied...

779
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:52,430
in front of the Hell of Deceit...

780
01:02:52,470 --> 01:02:55,520
If he knew the truth,
the trial would go to shit.

781
01:02:55,810 --> 01:02:58,930
I understand fully,
why the cap is doing this.

782
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:02,220
Remove Kim Su-Hong
from your head at once.

783
01:03:03,020 --> 01:03:04,930
It's his fate to be eliminated.

784
01:03:04,970 --> 01:03:07,100
Could you just hurry up?

785
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:09,520
It's been 3 days since you...

786
01:03:38,430 --> 01:03:41,220
It's alright, dude,
don't worry.

787
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:45,390
I'll come see you often
even after my discharge.

788
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:49,600
If the others bother you,
go tell Lt. Park.

789
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:51,770
It's not about that...

790
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:54,720
Your brother passed away.

791
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:59,220
I feel so bad
watching you bear it all.

792
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:11,600
Dong-yeon.

793
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:13,060
Private first class,
Won Dong-yeon.

794
01:04:19,850 --> 01:04:25,390
Let's not waste
new tears on the past.

795
01:04:26,470 --> 01:04:29,350
That's what my brother
said to me, dude.

796
01:04:32,770 --> 01:04:34,890
So stop crying like a bitch.

797
01:04:34,930 --> 01:04:36,770
I'm gonna forget him too.

798
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:43,890
Sergeant...

799
01:04:58,430 --> 01:05:00,270
Hold the rifle properly.

800
01:05:01,850 --> 01:05:03,060
I'm sorry!

801
01:05:19,390 --> 01:05:20,850
Dong-yeon, what's this?

802
01:05:21,850 --> 01:05:23,520
Why is it so hot?

803
01:05:29,810 --> 01:05:31,560
What do I do?

804
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:35,020
Dong-yeon...

805
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:37,310
Radio Lt. Park.

806
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:41,390
Don't let the others find out,
just him, okay?

807
01:05:42,270 --> 01:05:49,350
Just get Lt. Park...

808
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:52,390
Get Lt. Park!

809
01:05:57,270 --> 01:06:01,020
(GLACIAL CANYON)

810
01:06:05,430 --> 01:06:07,020
Good, very good!

811
01:06:08,180 --> 01:06:10,060
Look how happy you are!

812
01:06:11,350 --> 01:06:13,390
The next round is the Hell of Injustice.

813
01:06:13,430 --> 01:06:16,020
A trial for those
who were unjust.

814
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:19,310
We're exactly halfway there.

815
01:06:19,970 --> 01:06:23,720
But you said there are 7 trials,
and we've only done 3.

816
01:06:23,970 --> 01:06:28,270
Because you'll walk
right through this one.

817
01:06:29,020 --> 01:06:32,390
It's a hell that punishes
those who were unjust,

818
01:06:32,430 --> 01:06:37,600
so this one is not applicable
for a paragon like you.

819
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:50,180
My family's okay,
so why is this happening?

820
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:53,100
Indeed, very curious.

821
01:06:53,140 --> 01:06:55,180
Could we think about that
while we run?

822
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:08,180
Get in! Hurry!

823
01:07:10,810 --> 01:07:12,310
Hewonmak! Hurry!

824
01:07:13,390 --> 01:07:15,220
Hurry, get in!

825
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:24,640
Get to the front! Now!

826
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:41,220
Su-Hong! Su-Hong!

827
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:46,350
What happened?
Su-Hong! Hey!

828
01:07:47,970 --> 01:07:49,220
Su-Hong!

829
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:01,020
Wake up!

830
01:08:11,770 --> 01:08:15,060
Su-Hong, please...

831
01:08:16,310 --> 01:08:19,680
Open your eyes, asshole...

832
01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:23,930
Kim Su-Hong!

833
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:30,020
Sergeant!

834
01:08:31,350 --> 01:08:32,100
Lieutenant...

835
01:08:32,140 --> 01:08:34,970
I held him and...

836
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:37,560
The gun...

837
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,560
it fired by accident...

838
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:45,270
I held him,
and it just fired...

839
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:16,970
Let's clean up.

840
01:09:22,270 --> 01:09:24,350
You bastard!
Clean up the blood!

841
01:09:26,850 --> 01:09:27,850
No...

842
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:29,720
Let's move him first.

843
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:31,640
Listen to me, okay?

844
01:09:31,670 --> 01:09:36,080
Dong-yeon, look at me,
you didn't do it on purpose.

845
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:38,560
It's okay,
I can take care of it.

846
01:09:38,660 --> 01:09:41,820
My promotion
is next month, asshole!

847
01:09:53,270 --> 01:09:57,720
We gotta wipe the floor,
go find a mop.

848
01:09:58,100 --> 01:10:01,770
Clean it here with this,
let's hurry.

849
01:10:28,270 --> 01:10:29,350
Captain!

850
01:10:41,850 --> 01:10:44,970
(THE HELL OF INJUSTICE)

851
01:10:50,470 --> 01:10:53,100
These are cold-hearted souls.

852
01:10:53,140 --> 01:10:57,720
They're being punished for
refusing to help those in need,

853
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:00,140
so they're locked away in ice.

854
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:03,390
(GOD OF INJUSTICE)
Whether for a decade, or for a century.

855
01:11:06,310 --> 01:11:10,060
The worst crimes
in the Hell of Injustice

856
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:14,430
are those that have passed
the statute of limitations.

857
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:20,180
Where the truth was concealed
for selfish gains.

858
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:26,850
The statute of limitations
does not exist in hell.

859
01:11:27,270 --> 01:11:29,600
A crime in the living world
will never be erased.

860
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:32,390
What do we do with him?

861
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:35,520
I can't do this, sir!

862
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:39,060
A crime doesn't disappear
even if you keep quiet.

863
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:42,180
You got me into this mess!

864
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:44,850
Snap out of it!
You just killed a man!

865
01:11:44,890 --> 01:11:47,100
The longer you hide
your crimes,

866
01:11:47,140 --> 01:11:50,720
the harsher your punishment
in this hell.

867
01:11:50,890 --> 01:11:52,970
Su-Hong cared so much about you!

868
01:11:53,020 --> 01:11:55,140
He'll understand!

869
01:11:55,930 --> 01:11:58,180
Your son deserted
his post last night.

870
01:11:58,220 --> 01:11:59,850
We'll conduct a house search.

871
01:12:00,350 --> 01:12:01,720
Did he ever contact you?

872
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:56,140
What is cap still doing
in the living world?

873
01:12:56,180 --> 01:12:57,520
When I was young,

874
01:12:58,970 --> 01:13:05,310
Su-Hong pestered mother
to go on a cable car ride.

875
01:13:05,350 --> 01:13:06,810
Cable car? Jeez...

876
01:13:06,850 --> 01:13:11,600
I wanted to scold him
for being so immature.

877
01:13:12,350 --> 01:13:14,060
I envy you.

878
01:13:14,930 --> 01:13:15,930
Pardon?

879
01:13:21,310 --> 01:13:24,100
We don't have any
memories of our past.

880
01:13:24,140 --> 01:13:25,140
Hey!

881
01:13:29,970 --> 01:13:32,520
We don't know how we died.

882
01:13:34,350 --> 01:13:35,850
Not a single memory.

883
01:13:37,270 --> 01:13:42,020
That's what I envy the most
while doing this work.

884
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:46,180
All 3 of you have
no memories?

885
01:13:46,810 --> 01:13:49,140
Except Gang-lim.

886
01:13:49,770 --> 01:13:54,060
Hewonmak and a petty guardian
like myself have no memories.

887
01:13:55,020 --> 01:13:57,180
I wish I had some...

888
01:13:58,350 --> 01:14:01,390
Is this a confessional?
Stop it already.

889
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:07,930
There's an interesting truth
when you listen to the souls.

890
01:14:07,970 --> 01:14:13,060
Even the tragic memories
become beautiful ones

891
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:15,930
when they reach the Afterlife.

892
01:14:16,770 --> 01:14:18,470
Just like this place.

893
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:20,770
Isn't it beautiful?

894
01:14:24,430 --> 01:14:25,600
Lee Deok-choon!

895
01:14:28,270 --> 01:14:29,270
"Beautiful"?

896
01:14:30,020 --> 01:14:33,140
How does this place
look beautiful to you?

897
01:14:33,180 --> 01:14:34,470
This is hell!

898
01:14:35,140 --> 01:14:36,470
You like this place too?

899
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:38,770
Your brother'd love it here,
riding a cable car and all.

900
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:43,930
But he's a vengeful spirit,
he can't reach the Afterlife...

901
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:47,850
Pardon me?

902
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,350
What do you mean?

903
01:15:01,890 --> 01:15:02,890
Screw it!

904
01:15:03,060 --> 01:15:05,390
Your brother's dead!
He's the vengeful spirit!

905
01:15:05,430 --> 01:15:07,890
The Afterlife's all screwed up
because of him!

906
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:38,680
This is why the living world
should be left alone!

907
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,890
Hold on!

908
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:49,930
Hold on tight!

909
01:15:50,890 --> 01:15:52,720
Hold still!
Don't move!

910
01:15:52,770 --> 01:15:53,890
Don't move!

911
01:15:56,100 --> 01:15:57,220
Hold still!

912
01:16:17,310 --> 01:16:18,430
Grab my hand!

913
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:20,600
My mother is all alone now.

914
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:24,060
With Su-Hong gone,
I'll have to reincarnate!

915
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:26,720
I have to meet her!

916
01:16:26,770 --> 01:16:29,220
So please help me!
I'm begging you!

917
01:16:29,270 --> 01:16:30,520
Grab my hand!

918
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:33,180
How can I?
I only have 2 hands!

919
01:16:33,850 --> 01:16:35,470
Her! Help her!

920
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:37,430
Grab her!

921
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:53,390
You sure love to mess
with the living world.

922
01:16:54,180 --> 01:16:55,470
It's your hobby.

923
01:16:59,430 --> 01:17:01,590
He should be incinerated,
so why bother unearthing him?

924
01:17:02,220 --> 01:17:03,640
To give him a funeral?

925
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:06,350
Or let the world know
where he's buried?

926
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:09,640
His mother...

927
01:17:10,430 --> 01:17:12,640
She'll never know the truth.

928
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:15,100
Let's give him
a proper burial.

929
01:17:15,970 --> 01:17:17,390
A proper burial?

930
01:17:17,430 --> 01:17:19,640
We're the ones
about to get buried.

931
01:17:20,470 --> 01:17:23,680
With both brothers dead,
do you feel sorry for her?

932
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:26,430
Are we in Saving Private Ryan?

933
01:17:36,770 --> 01:17:37,770
Let's burn him.

934
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,220
Afterlife Law, Article 8.2!

935
01:17:44,350 --> 01:17:48,720
A vengeful spirit must be eliminated
and its body incinerated immediately!

936
01:17:53,930 --> 01:17:55,720
Are you breaking the law?

937
01:17:55,770 --> 01:17:57,520
You are disobeying my orders.

938
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:08,220
Go back.

939
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:09,970
I'll catch the vengeful spirit.

940
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:19,520
Alright, I'll sign you off
on a 3-day vacation.

941
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:23,020
There's some money inside,
so go rest for a few days.

942
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:25,680
I'm okay, sir.

943
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:29,560
You're okay?

944
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:33,770
Look at your face right now.

945
01:18:37,770 --> 01:18:41,520
Why are you shivering?
Still cold?

946
01:18:44,890 --> 01:18:48,970
What if you get interrogated
in this state?

947
01:18:49,930 --> 01:18:52,720
Look at your face.
Look at it!

948
01:19:00,470 --> 01:19:01,470
Dong-yeon.

949
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:05,270
Go and think about it
for a few days.

950
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:08,890
We have to be strong.

951
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:14,140
Do me this favor.

952
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:23,850
(HEAVENLY PASSAGE)
This is the Heavenly Passage.

953
01:19:23,890 --> 01:19:26,970
We'll reach The Hell of Betrayal
through here.

954
01:19:28,270 --> 01:19:32,310
Souls who betrayed faith
are locked away in a mirror

955
01:19:32,350 --> 01:19:34,890
(HELL OF BETRAYAL)
and get destroyed.

956
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:45,060
The Goddess of Betrayal is beautiful.

957
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:47,680
(GODDESS OF BETRAYAL)
And just like her beauty,

958
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:52,560
she'll only forgive beautiful betrayal.

959
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:54,020
Isn't that beautiful betrayal?

960
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:56,520
A beautiful betrayal is
selfless betrayal,

961
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:58,640
or a righteous one,

962
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:00,930
or a betrayal of the conscience.

963
01:20:01,390 --> 01:20:06,100
So a righteous man like you
gets a free pass through here.

964
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:17,680
Shed this futile grudge that is
disrupting the two worlds

965
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:21,020
and give up your revenge!

966
01:22:03,470 --> 01:22:05,140
If you comply,

967
01:22:05,770 --> 01:22:14,720
I'll defend you till the end
so that you'll be reincarnated.

968
01:22:14,810 --> 01:22:16,220
Screw reincarnation.

969
01:22:17,470 --> 01:22:19,060
And why should I do
what you ask?

970
01:22:19,850 --> 01:22:22,470
Your brother is in danger
because of you.

971
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:25,810
Brother?

972
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:29,180
I don't have one.

973
01:22:29,770 --> 01:22:32,470
Why should I care about someone
who left home 15 years ago

974
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:34,680
and came back
as a dead body?

975
01:22:37,220 --> 01:22:41,020
I understand your rage
and grudge from that day.

976
01:22:42,310 --> 01:22:43,600
So please stop.

977
01:22:43,770 --> 01:22:45,180
How would you know that?

978
01:22:46,310 --> 01:22:47,770
I didn't die that night!

979
01:22:49,020 --> 01:22:50,520
I was buried alive!

980
01:22:52,430 --> 01:22:55,850
How would you understand
the pain of being buried alive

981
01:22:55,890 --> 01:22:57,430
for a whole day?

982
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:01,390
I was suffocating,

983
01:23:02,140 --> 01:23:05,310
and in that wet shallow grave,
I begged for help!

984
01:23:05,350 --> 01:23:06,810
Begged for help...

985
01:23:08,060 --> 01:23:10,720
A desperate and painful
cry for help.

986
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:13,180
Just like my father.

987
01:23:13,850 --> 01:23:14,850
Father!

988
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:18,970
But they didn't hear you,

989
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:20,270
they thought you were dead.

990
01:23:21,890 --> 01:23:23,890
So you'll calm
my vengeful spirit?

991
01:23:38,390 --> 01:23:42,680
No, I'll decline.

992
01:23:42,790 --> 01:23:45,250
You don't know!

993
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:50,720
They buried my trust
and hope that day!

994
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:52,520
They betrayed me!

995
01:24:24,220 --> 01:24:27,930
So you'll betray me?

996
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:32,930
He was so good to me...

997
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:36,770
It's too hard...

998
01:24:36,810 --> 01:24:39,680
You got me into this damn mess.

999
01:25:04,890 --> 01:25:07,560
Cap, why are you back already?

1000
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:10,430
Go, keep going!

1001
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:15,930
He didn't visit home even once
for 15 years after high school.

1002
01:25:16,470 --> 01:25:18,560
I thought he was a good son.

1003
01:25:19,310 --> 01:25:23,220
So he just sent money home
after all that?

1004
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:24,560
Who cares!

1005
01:25:24,850 --> 01:25:27,100
Cap, you should go eliminate
the vengeful spirit.

1006
01:25:27,140 --> 01:25:29,720
At this rate,
the hell ghouls will get us,

1007
01:25:29,770 --> 01:25:31,180
or we'll be eliminated.

1008
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:33,060
What the hell!

1009
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:37,100
I'm begging you.

1010
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:41,930
Please do not eliminate
my brother.

1011
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:44,350
Why not ask us to
raise the dead instead?

1012
01:25:46,430 --> 01:25:50,430
If that's possible,
bring him back to life.

1013
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:52,560
Mr. Kim,

1014
01:25:53,220 --> 01:25:56,520
we're only capable of
bringing souls here

1015
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:58,470
and eliminating the vengeful spirit.

1016
01:26:00,430 --> 01:26:02,470
No way!

1017
01:26:03,770 --> 01:26:05,140
Save him!

1018
01:26:05,770 --> 01:26:08,220
I know you all can do it!

1019
01:26:09,180 --> 01:26:10,270
Please!

1020
01:26:12,350 --> 01:26:13,600
Save him!

1021
01:26:15,220 --> 01:26:18,020
Please help my brother...

1022
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:12,810
In despair because of me!

1023
01:27:12,850 --> 01:27:18,220
On a suicide watch list,
Private Won Dong-yeon!

1024
01:27:43,310 --> 01:27:46,560
(VACUUM SINK HOLE)

1025
01:27:50,180 --> 01:27:56,600
This is the entrance
to the Hell of Violence.

1026
01:27:57,270 --> 01:28:00,220
The depth is depended
on the defendant's crime.

1027
01:28:00,270 --> 01:28:02,430
You're a paragon,
so it won't take long.

1028
01:28:02,470 --> 01:28:05,020
I saw you saving dogs
and pigs during a flood.

1029
01:28:05,890 --> 01:28:08,560
Don't be scared,
this is far easier than that.

1030
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:11,350
She'll go over the charges
as soon as we jump

1031
01:28:11,390 --> 01:28:15,680
so let her do her thing,
and just jump!

1032
01:28:18,020 --> 01:28:19,020
Begin.

1033
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:36,640
In despair because of me...

1034
01:28:38,020 --> 01:28:44,100
On a suicide watch list,
Private Won Dong-yeon.

1035
01:28:45,850 --> 01:28:51,520
When you reach your barracks,

1036
01:28:55,770 --> 01:29:01,430
don't ask the seniors
their age.

1037
01:29:14,310 --> 01:29:16,680
Help that stupid idiot.

1038
01:29:17,310 --> 01:29:18,310
I beg of you.

1039
01:29:21,100 --> 01:29:23,560
A guardian cannot interfere
with the living world.

1040
01:29:24,430 --> 01:29:25,520
I won't flee again.

1041
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:27,520
I won't.

1042
01:29:28,060 --> 01:29:29,930
Making any physical changes
is prohibited...

1043
01:29:29,970 --> 01:29:32,890
Just save that
pathetic bastard! Please!

1044
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:43,270
I'll do what you ask.

1045
01:29:44,470 --> 01:29:45,560
I promise.

1046
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:48,720
Whatever it is.

1047
01:30:24,810 --> 01:30:25,850
A figurative question!

1048
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:27,680
What's causing this phenomenon?

1049
01:30:28,430 --> 01:30:30,970
The captain has done something
he should never do!

1050
01:30:31,020 --> 01:30:35,350
He's meddled with the living world!

1051
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:36,770
Stay back!

1052
01:30:39,020 --> 01:30:40,020
No!

1053
01:30:47,020 --> 01:30:48,720
He'll live through this.

1054
01:30:48,770 --> 01:30:50,220
Yes, thank you.

1055
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:55,220
Let's go.
The ambulance is coming.

1056
01:31:01,430 --> 01:31:03,100
Hey buddy, hold on right there.

1057
01:31:10,930 --> 01:31:13,310
I've got some last words for him.

1058
01:31:14,470 --> 01:31:16,970
I want you to pass it along.

1059
01:31:19,220 --> 01:31:22,560
So demanding for a prick
who wants a favor.

1060
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:24,430
So fucking disrespectful.

1061
01:31:25,390 --> 01:31:27,520
Respectfully, sir,
please do this for me.

1062
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:30,140
I'm willing to do
whatever you ask of me.

1063
01:31:30,850 --> 01:31:33,060
I'll be respectful.

1064
01:31:44,680 --> 01:31:46,020
- Dong-yeon.
- Dong-yeon.

1065
01:31:48,470 --> 01:31:50,770
- It's me, Sgt. Kim.
- It's me, Sgt. Kim.

1066
01:32:00,890 --> 01:32:05,390
Arriving at the base,

1067
01:32:05,430 --> 01:32:08,770
assigned to a barrack.

1068
01:32:10,430 --> 01:32:12,430
Surrounded by

1069
01:32:14,850 --> 01:32:16,930
my seniors,

1070
01:32:18,350 --> 01:32:23,390
notified of the draft...

1071
01:32:24,970 --> 01:32:29,930
Something over my heart!

1072
01:32:30,890 --> 01:32:35,680
A watch badge!

1073
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:41,720
Angry faces of
my seniors,

1074
01:32:41,770 --> 01:32:47,060
everything is scary.

1075
01:32:47,850 --> 01:32:52,520
In despair because of me!

1076
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:53,680
Sergeant?

1077
01:32:55,850 --> 01:32:57,180
Sgt. Kim...

1078
01:33:05,470 --> 01:33:06,520
Grab Deok-choon!

1079
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:08,680
Grab her!

1080
01:33:25,430 --> 01:33:26,560
No! No!

1081
01:33:28,140 --> 01:33:30,640
Kim! My hand! Grab it!

1082
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:32,390
Grab my hand! Hurry!

1083
01:33:33,180 --> 01:33:34,180
My hand!

1084
01:33:35,220 --> 01:33:36,970
So what did you do?

1085
01:33:42,020 --> 01:33:45,220
Tell me again.

1086
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:49,350
I didn't do anything wrong.

1087
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:54,060
- Right, you didn't do
- ...anything wrong.

1088
01:33:54,100 --> 01:33:56,310
Let's make a promise.

1089
01:33:57,020 --> 01:33:58,850
From here on,

1090
01:33:58,890 --> 01:34:01,520
from this moment on,

1091
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:03,060
let's

1092
01:34:03,770 --> 01:34:05,390
never

1093
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:10,140
ever waste

1094
01:34:10,180 --> 01:34:14,060
new tears on the past.

1095
01:34:14,390 --> 01:34:16,930
Promise me.

1096
01:34:31,930 --> 01:34:34,060
Assistant Guardian?

1097
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:43,640
Wow! Korean firefighters
should join the Avengers!

1098
01:34:44,470 --> 01:34:45,680
Are you okay?

1099
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:48,850
Hewonmak!

1100
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:52,350
This trial has a victim.

1101
01:34:57,270 --> 01:34:58,350
A victim?

1102
01:35:00,180 --> 01:35:03,390
(HELL OF VIOLENCE)

1103
01:35:07,810 --> 01:35:09,560
What's going on?

1104
01:35:11,020 --> 01:35:13,020
Who did he beat up?

1105
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:25,890
(GOD OF VIOLENCE)

1106
01:35:25,930 --> 01:35:27,060
Your Majesty!

1107
01:35:27,390 --> 01:35:30,970
This case is about
an indiscriminate beating

1108
01:35:31,020 --> 01:35:35,850
of the defendant's own brother
when he was in high school!

1109
01:35:36,720 --> 01:35:41,180
You may say that brothers
get into fights often,

1110
01:35:41,220 --> 01:35:44,810
but there is something
you must pay attention to!

1111
01:35:44,850 --> 01:35:47,680
His brother was suffering from
malnutrition at the time!

1112
01:35:48,520 --> 01:35:52,770
This was a time when he required
protection from his brother,

1113
01:35:52,810 --> 01:35:56,850
so the nature of Kim's crime
is extremely heinous!

1114
01:36:04,140 --> 01:36:05,810
Don't!

1115
01:36:07,350 --> 01:36:10,140
Don't hit me!

1116
01:36:10,220 --> 01:36:13,720
Don't do that...

1117
01:36:13,770 --> 01:36:17,310
No, Ja-Hong,
don't do that...

1118
01:36:42,520 --> 01:36:44,180
I knew this'd happen.

1119
01:36:44,220 --> 01:36:46,430
Irresponsible bastard...

1120
01:37:05,930 --> 01:37:06,930
Let's leave.

1121
01:37:13,270 --> 01:37:14,770
What the hell?!

1122
01:37:15,850 --> 01:37:16,890
Dammit...

1123
01:37:18,100 --> 01:37:21,220
I won't flee,
I promised you!

1124
01:37:21,270 --> 01:37:22,600
Shut up and walk.

1125
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:24,220
We must recover
your body first.

1126
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:37,020
What's interesting is that

1127
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:41,390
this case is tied
to the final trial.

1128
01:37:42,140 --> 01:37:44,520
Any record of forgiveness
given to the defendant?

1129
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:45,970
No, Your Majesty.

1130
01:37:47,100 --> 01:37:48,720
After the incident,

1131
01:37:48,770 --> 01:37:52,600
neither the perpetrator nor
the victim ever apologized,

1132
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:58,640
and it all simply ended sloppily,
ambiguously, and fizzled!

1133
01:37:58,680 --> 01:38:02,930
That's how it ended
in our records.

1134
01:38:08,390 --> 01:38:11,390
But that doesn't make any sense.

1135
01:38:11,850 --> 01:38:13,180
They had to live together.

1136
01:38:13,970 --> 01:38:14,970
No!

1137
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:19,180
After the incident,
the defendant ran away

1138
01:38:19,220 --> 01:38:22,720
and didn't come home for
15 years until his death,

1139
01:38:22,770 --> 01:38:26,100
never once stepping his foot
inside this house again.

1140
01:38:29,770 --> 01:38:30,970
Your Majesty!

1141
01:38:31,020 --> 01:38:33,640
Honorable God of Violence!
May I begin our defense?

1142
01:38:33,680 --> 01:38:35,850
I've heard enough!
What's the point?

1143
01:38:35,890 --> 01:38:38,140
No forgiveness and
there's a victim.

1144
01:38:38,180 --> 01:38:39,180
It's over!

1145
01:38:40,020 --> 01:38:41,180
Convict him at once!

1146
01:39:14,850 --> 01:39:15,850
Deok-choon.

1147
01:39:16,390 --> 01:39:19,310
I'll carry out my idea
without consulting you first.

1148
01:39:20,390 --> 01:39:21,470
Get in there.

1149
01:39:22,720 --> 01:39:23,640
Go on!

1150
01:39:23,680 --> 01:39:25,100
Cap! Cap!

1151
01:39:26,220 --> 01:39:27,220
Captain!

1152
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:29,890
Lee Deok-choon.

1153
01:39:29,930 --> 01:39:31,390
Assistant Guardian
Lee Deok-choon here!

1154
01:39:31,430 --> 01:39:32,680
Request a combined trial.

1155
01:39:35,810 --> 01:39:37,640
A combined trial?

1156
01:39:38,890 --> 01:39:41,180
It's my brother!
Hey, Ja-Hong!

1157
01:39:41,220 --> 01:39:43,970
Kim Ja-Hong!
What're you doing there?

1158
01:39:47,100 --> 01:39:48,520
Request it at once!

1159
01:39:48,770 --> 01:39:49,770
But cap...

1160
01:39:50,350 --> 01:39:51,930
Let's cut our losses here.

1161
01:39:53,100 --> 01:39:54,680
- Hold on!
- Lee Deok-choon!

1162
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:59,390
I'll now read
Kim Ja-hong's final verdict.

1163
01:40:01,020 --> 01:40:02,520
- We did it!
- Good work!

1164
01:40:03,310 --> 01:40:04,310
Deok-choon!

1165
01:40:05,430 --> 01:40:06,430
Your Majesty!

1166
01:40:06,470 --> 01:40:08,140
Your Majesty! Sir!

1167
01:40:08,770 --> 01:40:09,930
Please!

1168
01:40:10,350 --> 01:40:12,600
In regards to the defendant's
violent crimes,

1169
01:40:12,640 --> 01:40:16,390
I'd like to request a combined
trial at the next trial.

1170
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:18,810
A combined trial?

1171
01:40:20,270 --> 01:40:21,350
You hear that?

1172
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:24,930
What say you?

1173
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:30,180
I'd like to know if
the assistant guardian

1174
01:40:30,220 --> 01:40:34,220
knows what she's requesting

1175
01:40:34,640 --> 01:40:37,270
in her own words.

1176
01:40:40,430 --> 01:40:42,390
If he's found guilty
in the next trial,

1177
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:50,020
where the crime is related,
he'll receive a double punishment,

1178
01:40:53,430 --> 01:40:58,430
and his guardians will be
stripped of their privileges

1179
01:41:00,180 --> 01:41:01,680
in the Afterlife...

1180
01:41:02,930 --> 01:41:04,020
Deal!

1181
01:41:20,020 --> 01:41:21,180
Do I go to the Afterlife now?

1182
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:22,640
Take the lead.

1183
01:41:22,680 --> 01:41:23,680
To the base first.

1184
01:41:24,390 --> 01:41:25,390
Sure.

1185
01:41:54,600 --> 01:41:56,270
This is it,

1186
01:41:56,310 --> 01:41:58,720
(ETERNAL DESERT)
The Hell of Filial Impiety.

1187
01:41:59,430 --> 01:42:01,720
A combined trial, Mr. Kim!

1188
01:42:02,770 --> 01:42:06,100
Deok-choon, stay alert.

1189
01:42:14,020 --> 01:42:17,180
We must visit where you lived
3 times before moving on.

1190
01:42:17,970 --> 01:42:20,810
Don't even think about
taking off.

1191
01:42:20,850 --> 01:42:22,600
That idiot.

1192
01:42:23,680 --> 01:42:26,850
That pussy, I knew
he couldn't go through with it.

1193
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:31,430
Back at that trial,

1194
01:42:32,850 --> 01:42:34,350
do you know why
he beat me up?

1195
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:35,970
No, let's go.

1196
01:42:36,930 --> 01:42:39,100
We must go up
before the final trial.

1197
01:42:39,140 --> 01:42:40,180
That night,

1198
01:42:40,890 --> 01:42:42,850
I woke up to find

1199
01:42:44,220 --> 01:42:46,560
Ja-Hong hesitating
before Mom.

1200
01:42:50,310 --> 01:42:52,100
So I asked him
what he was doing.

1201
01:42:52,850 --> 01:42:54,060
What are you doing?

1202
01:42:58,520 --> 01:43:00,430
Ja-Hong, what's up?

1203
01:43:07,770 --> 01:43:09,560
What are you doing
with the pillow?

1204
01:43:11,180 --> 01:43:12,310
Don't do it!

1205
01:43:16,180 --> 01:43:17,270
Don't do it!

1206
01:43:21,470 --> 01:43:24,470
Stop it!
Don't hurt her!

1207
01:43:29,850 --> 01:43:32,810
That hurts!

1208
01:43:34,430 --> 01:43:38,060
Don't hurt me!

1209
01:43:40,430 --> 01:43:42,720
On the night of the incident,

1210
01:43:46,020 --> 01:43:49,100
did you try to...

1211
01:43:50,890 --> 01:43:53,220
kill your mother?

1212
01:43:55,680 --> 01:43:58,720
Is that so?
That's it?

1213
01:43:59,770 --> 01:44:02,180
That's why the last
two trials are related.

1214
01:44:02,930 --> 01:44:05,600
You attempted murder
on your mother?

1215
01:44:05,640 --> 01:44:09,430
So the Hell of Filial Impiety
is the last stop...

1216
01:44:10,850 --> 01:44:12,100
I see it now.

1217
01:44:12,140 --> 01:44:14,020
Answer me, Mr. Kim.

1218
01:44:15,310 --> 01:44:19,470
Were you trying to
kill her that night?

1219
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:25,600
No.

1220
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:30,720
Not just her.

1221
01:44:35,180 --> 01:44:39,520
I wanted all 3 of us to die.

1222
01:44:42,520 --> 01:44:46,520
We had no hope whatsoever.

1223
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:53,770
I'd kill my terminally ill mother first,

1224
01:44:55,430 --> 01:44:56,600
and then,

1225
01:44:58,680 --> 01:45:05,810
my brother and I were
going to take sleeping pills.

1226
01:45:07,930 --> 01:45:11,350
Is that when you decided?

1227
01:45:15,140 --> 01:45:19,520
The day you left home
out of guilt,

1228
01:45:21,180 --> 01:45:24,100
you decided to live

1229
01:45:25,720 --> 01:45:27,770
for your mother and brother

1230
01:45:29,270 --> 01:45:32,970
until your last breath.

1231
01:45:34,810 --> 01:45:36,060
Is that it?

1232
01:45:38,850 --> 01:45:40,850
No...

1233
01:45:48,100 --> 01:45:49,890
Don't look at her.

1234
01:45:49,930 --> 01:45:51,970
Can't you read?
Don't look at her.

1235
01:45:52,520 --> 01:45:54,220
Let's hurry up.

1236
01:45:54,270 --> 01:45:55,560
Sure thing.

1237
01:45:57,350 --> 01:45:59,350
She's back again.

1238
01:45:59,390 --> 01:46:00,680
Go stop her.

1239
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:02,560
(PLEASE FIND MY SON, KIM SU-HONG.
I MISS HIM DEARLY.)

1240
01:46:02,600 --> 01:46:04,350
Ma'am, you can't
keep coming back.

1241
01:46:04,680 --> 01:46:07,060
Sgt. Kim isn't at the base.

1242
01:46:07,100 --> 01:46:09,520
Ma'am, you can't come inside!

1243
01:46:09,560 --> 01:46:11,060
- Ma'am!
- Please don't do this!

1244
01:46:11,100 --> 01:46:13,270
You're making it
difficult for us!

1245
01:46:16,520 --> 01:46:17,520
Ma'am!

1246
01:46:19,850 --> 01:46:21,810
Huh? Mom?

1247
01:46:23,770 --> 01:46:25,180
Why is she here?

1248
01:46:25,220 --> 01:46:26,640
Ma'am! Please stop!

1249
01:46:43,810 --> 01:46:45,430
Mom, don't cry!

1250
01:46:45,640 --> 01:46:50,310
After I left, I couldn't
bear to see her again.

1251
01:46:51,310 --> 01:46:54,850
Time simply passed after that.

1252
01:46:55,560 --> 01:47:01,220
So whenever you missed her,
you wrote her letters.

1253
01:47:28,520 --> 01:47:31,180
You can't be here,
get out of here!

1254
01:47:31,270 --> 01:47:32,140
What is he doing?!

1255
01:47:32,180 --> 01:47:33,270
Kim Su-Hong!

1256
01:47:34,600 --> 01:47:35,600
It's no use.

1257
01:47:36,220 --> 01:47:38,350
- There's nothing you can do.
- Get out.

1258
01:47:50,270 --> 01:47:51,560
I can empathize.

1259
01:47:51,930 --> 01:47:56,560
A terminally ill mother,
a brother with malnutrition,

1260
01:47:56,600 --> 01:48:00,060
but no one ever offers a hand.

1261
01:48:00,430 --> 01:48:02,770
So you made a decision!

1262
01:48:05,180 --> 01:48:08,470
Kill your mother first,
your brother, then yourself!

1263
01:48:08,600 --> 01:48:09,470
Hewonmak...

1264
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:12,390
He's the furthest thing
from a paragon.

1265
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:29,720
Where did you get this?

1266
01:48:30,770 --> 01:48:31,810
What are you waiting for?!

1267
01:48:32,770 --> 01:48:34,060
Throw her out!

1268
01:48:36,310 --> 01:48:39,180
Ma'am, I told you,
you can't come in here!

1269
01:48:42,100 --> 01:48:45,270
Deok-choon, let's start over,
that'll be faster.

1270
01:48:46,140 --> 01:48:47,140
You know that.

1271
01:48:48,390 --> 01:48:49,470
Of course you do.

1272
01:48:49,930 --> 01:48:51,180
We can start over.

1273
01:48:51,970 --> 01:48:53,350
A century flies by fast.

1274
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:56,970
Time flies quickly.
Reincarnation is a pipe dream.

1275
01:48:57,020 --> 01:48:59,180
We're better off in the Afterlife.

1276
01:49:11,970 --> 01:49:14,100
Please, ma'am!

1277
01:49:17,560 --> 01:49:20,180
Don't do this, please...

1278
01:49:21,270 --> 01:49:23,020
Your son is a deserter!

1279
01:49:27,890 --> 01:49:29,850
Kim Su-Hong, let's go.

1280
01:49:30,890 --> 01:49:33,270
Your mother is living her life.

1281
01:50:00,390 --> 01:50:02,720
Kim Su-Hong!

1282
01:50:42,640 --> 01:50:43,640
Run!

1283
01:50:45,970 --> 01:50:47,220
Hewonmak!

1284
01:52:04,780 --> 01:52:06,160
Hewonmak!

1285
01:52:42,470 --> 01:52:43,930
No! Please!

1286
01:53:01,640 --> 01:53:05,390
No! No!

1287
01:53:06,180 --> 01:53:08,020
No!

1288
01:53:28,770 --> 01:53:30,180
Take a look, Kim Su-Hong!

1289
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:33,850
The last image of your brother,

1290
01:53:33,890 --> 01:53:36,220
as remembered by
you and your mother.

1291
01:54:42,770 --> 01:54:47,640
It's the Hell of Filial Impiety...

1292
01:55:15,970 --> 01:55:19,220
(ELL OF FILIAL IMPIETY)

1293
01:55:30,640 --> 01:55:32,390
Defendant Kim Ja-Hong!

1294
01:55:32,470 --> 01:55:38,310
I will now begin
the final verdict for your sins

1295
01:55:38,350 --> 01:55:40,930
against your mother!

1296
01:55:42,350 --> 01:55:45,390
Your Majesty!
Allow us to defend him!

1297
01:55:46,270 --> 01:55:49,390
The final verdict!
Defendant Kim Ja-Hong!

1298
01:55:49,430 --> 01:55:50,430
Guilty!

1299
01:55:57,020 --> 01:55:58,680
The defendant!

1300
01:55:59,390 --> 01:56:01,640
- After that night!
- Attempted to murder...

1301
01:56:09,220 --> 01:56:11,520
The defendant did not
yield to his mother,

1302
01:56:11,560 --> 01:56:13,430
- After that night,
- despite all the hardships

1303
01:56:13,470 --> 01:56:16,350
- he did not rest at all yield to his mother,
- his mother suffered...

1304
01:56:16,850 --> 01:56:17,890
to support his family!

1305
01:56:17,930 --> 01:56:19,850
How dare you!

1306
01:56:20,430 --> 01:56:22,430
This trial is wrong!

1307
01:56:23,310 --> 01:56:25,270
She was unconscious!

1308
01:56:26,850 --> 01:56:28,560
There is no victim!

1309
01:56:29,890 --> 01:56:31,640
You don't know that!

1310
01:56:32,430 --> 01:56:34,430
You don't know anything...

1311
01:56:38,020 --> 01:56:39,770
Bring up the Mirror of Karma!

1312
01:56:46,810 --> 01:56:48,020
Ja-Hong!

1313
01:56:49,470 --> 01:56:50,600
Ja-Hong!

1314
01:56:54,310 --> 01:56:55,600
Don't do it!

1315
01:56:57,970 --> 01:57:01,140
Don't do this!
What are you doing?!

1316
01:57:03,220 --> 01:57:04,430
I don't know?

1317
01:57:05,850 --> 01:57:08,430
You're the ones,
who don't know anything.

1318
01:57:09,390 --> 01:57:12,890
Only your mother,
knew the truth.

1319
01:57:17,930 --> 01:57:22,180
The defendant's mother,
wasn't unconscious!

1320
01:57:22,720 --> 01:57:24,600
She knew that only her death

1321
01:57:24,640 --> 01:57:28,180
would allow her children,
to live comfortably!

1322
01:57:28,970 --> 01:57:32,390
She knew all along!
Do you not see?

1323
01:57:45,100 --> 01:57:46,310
Your mother lived

1324
01:57:46,890 --> 01:57:51,060
her painful life with,
a spike through her heart!

1325
01:57:51,100 --> 01:57:55,100
She buried the memory,
of that night in her heart

1326
01:57:55,140 --> 01:57:59,890
and waited for her,
pompous son to return!

1327
01:58:03,930 --> 01:58:05,060
I deserve to be punished!

1328
01:58:06,100 --> 01:58:12,140
I'll accept any punishment,
please let me see her!

1329
01:58:13,640 --> 01:58:19,810
I must apologize to her!

1330
01:58:33,560 --> 01:58:36,060
You couldn't even do that alive.

1331
01:58:38,140 --> 01:58:40,810
I gave you plenty of time!

1332
01:58:42,970 --> 01:58:44,850
15 long years!

1333
01:58:49,100 --> 01:58:50,640
Read the verdict.

1334
01:59:00,430 --> 01:59:02,180
The final verdict!

1335
01:59:03,060 --> 01:59:04,310
The defendant Kim Ja-Hong!

1336
01:59:04,350 --> 01:59:06,890
It's over, we're done.

1337
01:59:07,220 --> 01:59:08,850
Good job, captain.

1338
01:59:10,140 --> 01:59:12,520
What do we do with him?
Bury him again?

1339
01:59:13,310 --> 01:59:15,100
Or eliminate him?

1340
01:59:15,140 --> 01:59:18,020
And the guardians are,
to be stripped of their powers!

1341
01:59:18,060 --> 01:59:20,720
The defendant blamed
his life problems

1342
01:59:20,770 --> 01:59:24,520
and attempted murder
on his own family.

1343
01:59:24,560 --> 01:59:26,470
And as if that's not enough...

1344
01:59:33,020 --> 01:59:35,930
As if that's...

1345
01:59:35,970 --> 01:59:37,890
not enough,
he wasted 15 years...

1346
01:59:37,930 --> 01:59:38,970
Mom...

1347
01:59:39,810 --> 01:59:40,810
Mom?

1348
01:59:43,810 --> 01:59:45,140
Continue reading!

1349
01:59:46,720 --> 01:59:48,560
Despite causing
mental anguish,

1350
01:59:48,600 --> 01:59:51,970
he fled home for 15 years,
a filial impiety sin in itself!

1351
01:59:52,020 --> 01:59:53,220
Therefore, this court finds Kim...

1352
01:59:53,270 --> 01:59:54,390
Mom...

1353
01:59:56,140 --> 01:59:58,020
Mom, wake up.

1354
02:00:01,770 --> 02:00:03,350
Come on, wake up.

1355
02:00:05,060 --> 02:00:07,520
A dream visitation!
He's in her dream!

1356
02:00:08,140 --> 02:00:09,640
It's Gang-lim's doing!

1357
02:00:09,680 --> 02:00:12,850
Gang-lim, I order you
to halt her dream!

1358
02:00:13,430 --> 02:00:17,140
Your Majesty, you must
summon him at once...

1359
02:00:17,680 --> 02:00:19,600
Mom, wake up, hurry.

1360
02:00:27,220 --> 02:00:28,270
Mom.

1361
02:00:33,810 --> 02:00:34,810
Mom!

1362
02:00:39,180 --> 02:00:40,310
It's me, Su-Hong.

1363
02:00:45,020 --> 02:00:46,350
Look at this.

1364
02:00:47,720 --> 02:00:50,890
I'm a Supreme Court Justice,
aren't you happy?

1365
02:00:52,390 --> 02:00:54,770
How do I look?
It fits so perfectly.

1366
02:00:55,350 --> 02:00:57,270
See? I did it.

1367
02:00:59,600 --> 02:01:00,600
Mom.

1368
02:01:02,640 --> 02:01:03,640
Why is it so long?

1369
02:01:04,560 --> 02:01:05,600
Look, my minions.

1370
02:01:05,640 --> 02:01:06,640
Good afternoon.

1371
02:01:16,600 --> 02:01:17,600
Mom.

1372
02:01:21,430 --> 02:01:24,350
I can't visit you anymore.

1373
02:01:25,470 --> 02:01:30,060
Because I'm assigned
to be heaven's judge.

1374
02:01:30,100 --> 02:01:32,810
I gotta punish bad guys there.

1375
02:01:33,470 --> 02:01:36,600
So don't come to the base
looking for me.

1376
02:01:37,850 --> 02:01:39,310
Understand, Mom?

1377
02:01:40,310 --> 02:01:41,390
Got it?

1378
02:01:43,850 --> 02:01:45,180
Okay, Mom?

1379
02:01:45,770 --> 02:01:46,850
Okay?

1380
02:01:49,180 --> 02:01:50,520
Do you remember...

1381
02:01:53,350 --> 02:01:55,640
A long time ago,

1382
02:02:03,310 --> 02:02:05,680
when you were
in the hospital,

1383
02:02:06,310 --> 02:02:09,810
I was sick with malnutrition.

1384
02:02:09,850 --> 02:02:12,600
You were in pain
and couldn't wake up.

1385
02:02:13,430 --> 02:02:15,850
Those were hard times, right?

1386
02:02:18,770 --> 02:02:21,020
And Ja-Hong...

1387
02:02:21,640 --> 02:02:24,140
that moron...

1388
02:02:25,520 --> 02:02:28,470
I heard you knew
he tried to kill us.

1389
02:02:28,520 --> 02:02:30,770
You knew all along,
is that true?

1390
02:02:32,520 --> 02:02:36,140
And this bastard
of a brother,

1391
02:02:37,020 --> 02:02:43,140
he couldn't come home
because he felt bad,

1392
02:02:43,850 --> 02:02:48,270
so he worked like crazy
to send us money.

1393
02:02:48,430 --> 02:02:51,680
Ja-Hong, that bastard...

1394
02:02:52,560 --> 02:02:57,520
Worked all his life...

1395
02:02:59,520 --> 02:03:04,220
For you and me...

1396
02:03:12,560 --> 02:03:14,060
Su-Hong...

1397
02:03:28,680 --> 02:03:29,970
My baby...

1398
02:03:34,140 --> 02:03:37,890
You boys didn't do
anything wrong.

1399
02:03:39,390 --> 02:03:40,560
It was all me,

1400
02:03:42,100 --> 02:03:44,810
it's all because
you had a terrible mom.

1401
02:03:45,640 --> 02:03:47,100
Do you understand?

1402
02:03:49,850 --> 02:03:52,180
I'm sorry.

1403
02:03:57,060 --> 02:03:58,270
I'm sorry.

1404
02:04:00,020 --> 02:04:01,430
I'm so sorry.

1405
02:04:02,930 --> 02:04:04,100
My baby...

1406
02:04:05,640 --> 02:04:07,220
I love you.

1407
02:04:09,020 --> 02:04:13,890
Ja-Hong...

1408
02:04:14,770 --> 02:04:16,270
Mom!

1409
02:04:16,310 --> 02:04:17,390
She can talk?

1410
02:04:17,850 --> 02:04:19,140
It's her dream.

1411
02:04:22,810 --> 02:04:24,770
Mom, Mom!

1412
02:04:25,680 --> 02:04:26,890
Mom...

1413
02:04:28,770 --> 02:04:30,520
Mom...

1414
02:04:32,970 --> 02:04:35,810
Mom...

1415
02:04:46,310 --> 02:04:47,850
I love you.

1416
02:04:50,310 --> 02:04:51,560
Mother!

1417
02:04:56,930 --> 02:04:59,560
Mother! Mother!

1418
02:05:12,220 --> 02:05:14,430
Mother...

1419
02:05:20,470 --> 02:05:23,680
All humans live with sins.

1420
02:05:26,100 --> 02:05:31,720
Only a few ever have the courage
to beg for forgiveness.

1421
02:05:33,180 --> 02:05:35,930
And only a fraction of them...

1422
02:05:39,680 --> 02:05:41,850
are truly forgiven.

1423
02:05:55,470 --> 02:05:57,600
Afterlife Law Article 1.1!

1424
02:05:58,390 --> 02:06:02,390
A sin that has been forgiven
in the living world

1425
02:06:02,430 --> 02:06:04,600
will not be judged
in the Afterlife.

1426
02:06:07,890 --> 02:06:09,680
Therefore, this court finds

1427
02:06:09,720 --> 02:06:12,680
Kim Ja-Hong innocent
of all charges,

1428
02:06:12,720 --> 02:06:16,100
and orders immediate reincarnation!

1429
02:07:04,850 --> 02:07:07,350
Thank you.

1430
02:07:49,930 --> 02:07:51,020
Bye, Mom!

1431
02:07:55,890 --> 02:07:57,890
So what do we do now?

1432
02:07:59,600 --> 02:08:01,020
Isn't it obvious?

1433
02:08:01,060 --> 02:08:02,560
Take him to the Afterlife.

1434
02:08:02,600 --> 02:08:03,600
Who?

1435
02:08:08,530 --> 02:08:10,070
Another paragon?

1436
02:08:10,100 --> 02:08:12,930
He's a vengeful spirit,
so how could he be honorable?

1437
02:08:12,970 --> 02:08:14,970
This is all wrong,
it's an error!

1438
02:08:16,060 --> 02:08:17,310
Are you sure?

1439
02:08:17,350 --> 02:08:20,680
And a vengeful spirit can't even
enter the Gate of the Afterlife!

1440
02:08:20,810 --> 02:08:21,970
Oh yeah?

1441
02:08:22,020 --> 02:08:23,640
You didn't know what happened,

1442
02:08:23,680 --> 02:08:25,720
and decided to
come for the show

1443
02:08:25,770 --> 02:08:26,850
after all was done?

1444
02:08:27,350 --> 02:08:30,100
You came down to meddle
when I didn't need you...

1445
02:08:30,140 --> 02:08:31,520
What? When did I?

1446
02:08:31,560 --> 02:08:33,390
I only came down
because you called me.

1447
02:08:33,430 --> 02:08:35,180
You told me not to act
on my instincts!

1448
02:08:35,220 --> 02:08:36,180
What?

1449
02:08:36,220 --> 02:08:38,970
"Hewonmak!" and you
summoned me.

1450
02:08:40,390 --> 02:08:42,970
You sure love to mess
with the living world.

1451
02:08:43,270 --> 02:08:46,310
Or let the world know
where he's buried?

1452
02:08:48,890 --> 02:08:51,270
Are you breaking the law?

1453
02:08:54,770 --> 02:08:56,520
Anyway, he can't
go to the Gate.

1454
02:08:58,770 --> 02:09:00,060
There's no need to go there.

1455
02:09:00,720 --> 02:09:03,520
Go to the Hell of Filial Impiety,
where Yeomra is.

1456
02:09:08,180 --> 02:09:10,810
Am I going to hell?
He didn't mention that.

1457
02:09:11,140 --> 02:09:12,930
This is so dumb...

1458
02:09:14,270 --> 02:09:17,890
A massive tornado touched down
yesterday in Kangwondo.

1459
02:09:18,390 --> 02:09:21,100
Such is not a common sight
in our country.

1460
02:09:21,470 --> 02:09:23,970
A tornado can be seen
on an island,

1461
02:09:24,020 --> 02:09:27,600
but it was the first time one
touched down on the peninsula.

1462
02:09:27,810 --> 02:09:28,810
Parcel delivery.

1463
02:09:28,850 --> 02:09:30,680
There weren't any casualties,

1464
02:09:30,720 --> 02:09:33,850
but a military base nearby
was heavily damaged.

1465
02:09:35,140 --> 02:09:36,680
Experts believe that...

1466
02:09:36,720 --> 02:09:41,310
"Cook... scorched... rice...

1467
02:09:41,350 --> 02:09:44,770
with... electric rice cooker...

1468
02:09:44,810 --> 02:09:46,850
comfortably."

1469
02:10:17,720 --> 02:10:20,680
Mother, it's your son Ja-Hong.

1470
02:10:22,100 --> 02:10:28,100
I heard that your condition
improved drastically.

1471
02:10:28,140 --> 02:10:32,770
Kim's last letter was
delivered to his mother.

1472
02:10:36,220 --> 02:10:39,430
I do not know what he wrote

1473
02:10:39,470 --> 02:10:43,390
in the letter that contained
the real truth.

1474
02:10:44,100 --> 02:10:45,850
I'm not curious either.

1475
02:10:48,720 --> 02:10:50,890
He was just another soul,

1476
02:10:50,930 --> 02:10:54,180
who tried to do
the right thing after death.

1477
02:10:54,850 --> 02:10:59,020
Mother, all the letters I sent you

1478
02:10:59,060 --> 02:11:02,680
were lies to make you
feel better.

1479
02:11:05,020 --> 02:11:08,180
I lied about having a wife
who made scorched rice,

1480
02:11:09,220 --> 02:11:14,850
or a son who looked
exactly like me.

1481
02:11:16,470 --> 02:11:22,640
I will come back home
before it's too late.

1482
02:11:35,100 --> 02:11:40,520
What I'm really curious about
is why I'm not being punished

1483
02:11:41,680 --> 02:11:44,680
for meddling with
the living world,

1484
02:11:46,140 --> 02:11:48,930
and why Yeomra tried to test me.

1485
02:11:50,430 --> 02:11:52,310
I need to ask him that.

1486
02:12:08,890 --> 02:12:10,770
We have an audience
with King Yeomra!

1487
02:12:11,680 --> 02:12:14,770
If you do not step aside,
you will perish!

1488
02:12:15,310 --> 02:12:16,970
Has he gone
absolutely mad?

1489
02:12:17,470 --> 02:12:21,270
I'm sure he has a plan.
He's very considerate.

1490
02:12:21,350 --> 02:12:23,600
Yeah, he's too considerate.

1491
02:12:23,640 --> 02:12:27,520
He's so considerate that
I can't figure him out.

1492
02:12:30,020 --> 02:12:31,970
Kim Su-Hong...

1493
02:12:32,020 --> 02:12:34,930
will be our 49th paragon.

1494
02:12:34,970 --> 02:12:37,280
The last one needed
for our reincarnation.

1495
02:12:37,310 --> 02:12:39,140
Let's go, Hewonmak!

1496
02:12:44,560 --> 02:12:45,680
I'll be back.

1497

(ALONG WITH THE GODS
The Two Worlds)

1498
02:13:07,560 --> 02:13:09,270
Hur Choon-Sam!

1499
02:13:10,970 --> 02:13:12,850
Hur Choon-Sam!

1500
02:13:15,850 --> 02:13:16,850
Hur!

1501
02:13:18,720 --> 02:13:22,930
You're the troublemaker
household god?

1502
02:13:29,350 --> 02:13:31,560
Damn, he's so cute.

1503
02:13:32,060 --> 02:13:34,770
Too bad he'll ride
the train to hell.
