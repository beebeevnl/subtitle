1
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,735
There is no sign
of the national guard.

2
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:12,237
Creatures are tearing up
the city.

3
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:16,809
- Many people eaten alive!

4
00:01:18,446 --> 00:01:19,845
They're coming!

5
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:23,415
Let's get outta here!

6
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:53,712
Open the door!
Open the door!

7
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:12,297
Mom? I know. Here, too.

8
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,600
Mom, you need to get up

9
00:02:14,602 --> 00:02:16,301
and lock the door
to your room, okay?

10
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,637
Don't let anyone in.
Not the nurses-

11
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,706
mom? Mom!

12
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,436
So now we've had time to see

13
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:53,739
what death looks like.

14
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:56,408
The question
for all of you is...

15
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,310
How did he die?

16
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,647
Now remember, the patient

17
00:03:01,649 --> 00:03:04,416
first complained
of a sore throat,

18
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:08,420
a fever, and a cough.

19
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:10,389
Considering these factors,

20
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:13,425
can you find this man's
cause of death?

21
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:25,504
So, any of you
got a theory on C.O.D.

22
00:03:25,506 --> 00:03:27,606
Based off this information?

23
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:29,274
Syphilis?

24
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:32,711
Nice try, Abby,
but I don't think

25
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,680
syphilis infects the lungs.

26
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:37,316
Peter.

27
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:39,818
Suzie?

28
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:50,562
Influenza.

29
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:54,399
Correct.
Now, what strain is it, Zoe?

30
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:57,769
It has to be h1n5.

31
00:03:57,771 --> 00:03:59,771
Close. H1n1.

32
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:01,773
Note the collapsed air sacs.

33
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:03,275
They couldn't inflate,

34
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:05,344
so they couldn't provide oxygen.

35
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:07,279
That's what killed him.

36
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:09,548
Oh, don't worry, Zoe.

37
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,817
You're not being graded today.

38
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:22,995
Hey, doc.

39
00:04:22,997 --> 00:04:24,997
Any chance you wanna come

40
00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:26,832
to the end of
the semester's fiesta?

41
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:29,568
What, and go drinking
with my students?

42
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:32,704
Think I'll pass.
Have fun.

43
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:34,039
You're coming, right?

44
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,540
No, you go ahead.

45
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:37,442
I have some tests
to finish up first.

46
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,044
Hey, don't beat yourself up.

47
00:04:39,046 --> 00:04:41,013
I know you can be obsessed
about these things.

48
00:04:41,015 --> 00:04:43,482
I know. I just...

49
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:46,485
Can't believe I didn't see it.

50
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:48,587
- Okay, call me.
- I will.

51
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:13,712
Sorry to bother you, Zoe.

52
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:15,580
Your regular just came in

53
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:18,016
to give his weekly blood sample.

54
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:20,052
Can Abby help?
He makes me uncomfortable.

55
00:05:20,054 --> 00:05:22,020
I know he's a bit strange,

56
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:23,689
but the antibodies in his blood

57
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:26,091
are a hundred times
normal level.

58
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:28,627
It's unlike anything
we've ever seen before.

59
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:30,595
Trust me, Zoe, this is a great

60
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:32,497
opportunity for you.

61
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,853
Hi, Zoe.

62
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,455
Hi, Max.

63
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:58,857
It's good to see you again.

64
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,692
Your arm.

65
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:03,929
Anything for you.

66
00:06:03,931 --> 00:06:05,530
Please roll up your sleeve.

67
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:09,501
Of course.

68
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,613
So...

69
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:25,584
Have you thought about
what I asked last time?

70
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:28,754
I told you, not interested, Max.

71
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,792
You know,
I'm never gonna give up.

72
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,895
You really should
give me a chance.

73
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:40,599
Make a fist.

74
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,405
Relax.

75
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:51,877
Like a vampire.

76
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,147
Sucking me dry.

77
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:05,891
Zoe, thank you
for being so gentle.

78
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:08,026
Your other arm.

79
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:25,744
What is that?

80
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:26,812
You like it?

81
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,482
This has to stop!

82
00:07:30,484 --> 00:07:32,217
Is there a problem in here, Zoe?

83
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:33,985
No.

84
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:36,021
I'm just giving
my weekly sample.

85
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:38,523
Get out of here,
you creepy old fuck!

86
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:44,863
Zoe.

87
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:47,732
This guy is crazy.

88
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:49,468
He won't leave me alone.

89
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,536
You can't let people
do that to you, Zoe.

90
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:53,071
Be stronger next time.

91
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:57,209
Come on.
The party's waiting.

92
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:04,816
Chug! Chug! Chug!

93
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,218
Yeah!

94
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:15,760
Doctor's orders.

95
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:17,262
Mingle. Drink.

96
00:08:17,264 --> 00:08:19,831
You know me, social gatherings.

97
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,100
We see these people
every day, Zoe.

98
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:24,536
Hey, babe, where you been?

99
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:26,938
Trying to get the shy one
out of her shell.

100
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,006
Let's grab a beer.

101
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,774
We tapped the first keg already.

102
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:30,976
But we got two more
chilling in the morgue.

103
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:32,077
Can one of you help me?

104
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:33,111
Oh, I got it.

105
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:36,147
I'll socialize after, I swear.

106
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:49,794
Peter?

107
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,005
Peter, where are you?

108
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:08,547
You're an asshole!

109
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:10,248
Come on. You know
every one of us

110
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,783
has wanted to do that.

111
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:14,586
No, just idiots like you.

112
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:16,721
Sorry.

113
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,690
I'm a dick, I know this.

114
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:22,093
Now, can we please go get drunk?

115
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:24,262
Just don't ever
do that to me again.

116
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:48,053
Max.

117
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:51,022
What are you doing down here?

118
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:54,326
Relax, Zoe.

119
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:58,163
I just wanna talk.

120
00:09:58,165 --> 00:10:00,699
There's nothing for us
to talk about.

121
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:04,636
See... we are connected.

122
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:06,304
There is no "we," Max.

123
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:07,672
We're meant...

124
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:09,908
To be together!

125
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,210
Let go of me! Peter!

126
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,215
- Give me a chance.
- No! No! Get off me!

127
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:18,683
Help me!

128
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:19,918
Shh.

129
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:27,926
Somebody help me!

130
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:29,928
I like it when you fight.

131
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:32,831
You are mine.

132
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,884
Zoe! Zoe!

133
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,724
Zoe!

134
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:02,694
- Zoe! Help!

135
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:07,298
Everybody, we have to get
the fuck out of here!

136
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,800
- What?
- Now! He's awake!

137
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:10,435
Zoe, what's going on?

138
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:13,371
Please move! Why the
hell aren't you moving?

139
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:15,907
- Come on!
- Dr. Beeman, are you okay?

140
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,781
Peter, no!
Get away from her!

141
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:23,848
Peter!

142
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:33,391
Abby, come on!
Come on!

143
00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:52,343
Zoe! Come on,
help me up there!

144
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:54,479
- Help!
- Abby, no!

145
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,951
Abby! Abby!

146
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:03,455
- Abby!

147
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:25,043
It's been five years
since the first outbreak.

148
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:27,278
When reports came out
from around the world

149
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,982
about the virus becoming
an international emergency,

150
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:32,317
it was too late.

151
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:34,819
Few of us survived.

152
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:37,789
The rest became rotters.

153
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:42,460
I was one of the lucky ones
to have made it

154
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:45,163
to one of the refugee camps
in time,

155
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:48,533
only to be assigned
to high rock bunker,

156
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:51,402
an intelligence
and recon military station

157
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:54,372
to gather data
of rotters for CDC.

158
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,475
Problem is...

159
00:12:57,477 --> 00:13:00,311
It's been a year
since we've heard from HQ.

160
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:04,415
And probably forever

161
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:06,317
since we saw a survivor.

162
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,789
So this is our home now...

163
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,423
Part military base,

164
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:15,059
part refugee camp.

165
00:13:15,061 --> 00:13:16,828
You make do with what you have,

166
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:19,531
scavenge what's left of life.

167
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:21,432
After all...

168
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:27,005
This is going to be our home
for a little while.

169
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:31,075
...please report
to station four right now.

170
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:32,977
Morning, Shannon.
How are your headaches?

171
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,313
Much better.
Thank you, Zoe.

172
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:38,583
You little devil, better
let your mom sleep tonight.

173
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:41,219
Here are a few announcements.

174
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:42,987
Today's lockdown
will occur at 1600...

175
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,489
Obeying the speed limit, Jeremy?

176
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,191
Never.

177
00:13:46,193 --> 00:13:47,592
Hey, doc,
you gonna hit the shower

178
00:13:47,594 --> 00:13:49,060
after your morning jog?

179
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:50,361
Let me know if you need a hand.

180
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:52,063
Easy up, Alphonse.
She's taken.

181
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:53,464
She knows I'm only joking, Lucy.

182
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:54,866
I'm just keeping myself fresh

183
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:56,234
till the right girl comes along.

184
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:58,169
You might be waiting a while.

185
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,839
That's cold, doc.
Real cold.

186
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:02,140
Come on, Alphonse.

187
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,877
Do you think
the lieutenant is right

188
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:08,847
and we're just wasting
our time here?

189
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:11,416
Maybe god doesn't want us
to reverse what happened.

190
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:13,551
Doesn't matter
that Miguel thinks.

191
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:15,587
We have a job to do.

192
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:17,422
Got your back.

193
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,566
Elyse, can you pass me
rotter sample number eight?

194
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:30,134
Sure thing.

195
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:36,341
Here you go.

196
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:40,979
I remember this one.

197
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:44,449
Guy had a nasty set
of bite marks on his hands.

198
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:47,018
What do you think
happened to him?

199
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,287
I'd say he had his hands down
the wrong girl's pants.

200
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,192
- Zoe?

201
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:57,929
Lily's fever shot up.

202
00:14:57,931 --> 00:15:00,331
The medicine you gave her
didn't work.

203
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,033
Meet me in the med ward.

204
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,914
Where does it hurt, sweetie?

205
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:18,917
Everywhere.

206
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:22,086
You're such a brave little girl.

207
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,689
Just close your eyes and rest.

208
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:26,991
I'll try and make you
feel better, okay?

209
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,500
As long as Jeff
can promise a heavy crop,

210
00:15:35,502 --> 00:15:37,201
we'll make it through winter.

211
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:37,201
I'll see what I can do.

212
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:39,671
Let's just hope mother
nature cooperates.

213
00:15:39,673 --> 00:15:41,506
Any other pressing issues?

214
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:44,075
Yeah, we found more rats
in the warehouse,

215
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:45,476
but Steve's taking care of it.

216
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:48,146
I've noticed a lot
of sloppiness as of late.

217
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,015
We're at war, people.

218
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:52,684
One error can ruin
all the work we've done here.

219
00:15:52,686 --> 00:15:54,585
I won't tolerate any mistakes.

220
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:56,421
Zoe, you're late.

221
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:58,556
I'm sorry for interrupting,
but it's serious.

222
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:01,993
What is it?

223
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:03,728
The antibiotics I used
on Lily aren't working.

224
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,463
She's worse.

225
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,165
I believe it's
bacterial pneumonia,

226
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,200
which is highly contagious.

227
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:10,268
I've quarantined her
for now, but still-

228
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,703
you're the town doctor.

229
00:16:11,705 --> 00:16:12,971
You're telling me there's
nothing you can do?

230
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:14,105
I don't have the antibiotics

231
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:16,474
to properly treat what Lily has.

232
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,242
We need to go on a supply run.

233
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:20,078
We've already ransacked
every place

234
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,379
within the designated range

235
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:23,047
for your bullshit
rotter research.

236
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:25,516
Then we need to go past
our usual search distance.

237
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:27,018
Be bolder.

238
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:30,321
I was a med student
at Whittendale University.

239
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,123
The medical supply
cache was secured

240
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,025
inside a locked vault.

241
00:16:34,027 --> 00:16:37,729
- I know the code.
- No. It's too far.

242
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:39,330
I know it's far,

243
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,232
but it is worth the risk.

244
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:43,067
We would have enough
medication to save Lily

245
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:44,669
and to stop her illness
from spreading.

246
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:46,337
Or we keep Lily isolated.

247
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:51,142
Keeping her isolated
will not help.

248
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:53,711
Her sickness will spread
inside this bunker.

249
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:55,313
Many of us will die.

250
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:58,149
It is a medical certainty.

251
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:06,124
Okay.

252
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:09,160
My brother, Baca, is gonna
lead your little field trip.

253
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:10,762
You leave tomorrow at dawn,
and you come right back.

254
00:17:10,764 --> 00:17:13,364
No sightseeing, no side tracks.

255
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:14,732
Are we absolutely clear?

256
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:16,200
Yes, sir.

257
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,122
It's gonna be okay.

258
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:45,730
I missed you.

259
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:21,766
No!

260
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:24,635
You are mine.

261
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:26,637
Somebody help me!

262
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,310
What's wrong?

263
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:33,544
Nothing.

264
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:36,881
What does that mean?

265
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,151
I have to go out.

266
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,555
Really? We talked about this
last time.

267
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:47,291
I just-
I have a lot on my mind.

268
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,893
What, and us?

269
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:51,529
That's not important?

270
00:18:51,531 --> 00:18:52,864
I love you, Zoe.

271
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:56,501
Look, I care about you.

272
00:18:56,503 --> 00:18:58,636
I do, but...

273
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:01,172
I need to go and check
on Lily right now.

274
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,537
Hey, Zoe.

275
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:34,572
Hey, sweetie.

276
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,376
Tomorrow morning,
I'm going outside

277
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:40,878
to try and find something
to make you better.

278
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,315
But there are rotters out there.

279
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:46,784
No, it's okay.

280
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:48,219
They don't scare me.

281
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:52,356
Do me a favor.

282
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,759
Will you hold on to this
for me while I'm gone?

283
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:56,694
It was my mom's.

284
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:02,366
It used to protect me
when I was a little girl.

285
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:04,835
Now, it'll do the same for you.

286
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:06,837
Thank you.

287
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:08,539
Good night, sweetie.

288
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:11,809
Good night.

289
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:29,293
Attention all civilians.

290
00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:32,830
Main team ready to leave
in t-minus three minutes.

291
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:34,265
Protocol...

292
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:35,800
I'll be back before you know it.

293
00:20:35,802 --> 00:20:37,401
All civilians are to clear

294
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:38,936
perimeter in their zones.

295
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:46,277
I repeat,
clear perimeter in all zones.

296
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,415
I'm sorry about last night.
I didn't...

297
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:55,019
No, I shouldn't
have reacted that way.

298
00:20:56,556 --> 00:20:59,023
Let's go get Lily her meds.

299
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:44,835
Team two, how's your status?

300
00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:46,370
East side perimeter clear.

301
00:21:46,372 --> 00:21:47,872
Nothing here.

302
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:52,376
I used to do this as a kid.

303
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:56,714
What?

304
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,384
You just never talked
about your childhood before.

305
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:06,691
Your mom? Your dad?

306
00:22:06,693 --> 00:22:08,326
There isn't much to talk about.

307
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:11,862
How about you?

308
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:15,700
My dad was an army man.

309
00:22:15,702 --> 00:22:16,734
Never smiled.

310
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:22,006
Except when he took
Miguel and I hunting.

311
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:24,842
Hard to believe
you two are brothers.

312
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,844
You're so different.

313
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,379
Miguel's always been
the way he is.

314
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,515
Always...

315
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:33,951
Wanted to be the superior one.

316
00:22:33,953 --> 00:22:36,020
Always wanted to control things.

317
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:39,924
Like my dad.

318
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:48,532
You know what I miss, man?

319
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:51,902
A nice, greasy cheeseburger
with fries.

320
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:55,373
I'd have to go with deep dish
pizza, Chicago style.

321
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:58,075
Solid.
What about you, Elyse?

322
00:22:58,077 --> 00:23:01,612
I miss Maggie's place.

323
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:03,848
It was a diner in Wichita

324
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:05,983
my mom used to take me to.

325
00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:08,686
Best damn apple pie
you ever tasted.

326
00:23:08,688 --> 00:23:12,089
Nice. Frank,
what do you miss, man?

327
00:23:12,091 --> 00:23:14,525
Ice cream sundaes?
Chicken nuggets?

328
00:23:14,527 --> 00:23:16,394
I miss people
shutting the fuck up.

329
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:29,607
Fuck! Something's wrong.

330
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:31,709
Everybody pull over.

331
00:23:31,711 --> 00:23:32,910
All right, people.
Look sharp.

332
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:33,944
Stay focused.

333
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,555
Set up a perimeter!

334
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:47,992
This is a bad spot.

335
00:23:47,994 --> 00:23:49,527
We won't see any rotters
until they're on us.

336
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:50,561
It's not like we had any say

337
00:23:50,563 --> 00:23:52,029
where we broke down, Alphonse.

338
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:53,831
You guys wanna keep it down
and watch your six.

339
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:55,132
Talk to me, Lucy.

340
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,870
- Come on!
- Fucking radiator again.

341
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:02,173
Savin said it was good to go.

342
00:24:02,175 --> 00:24:04,008
All right.
Well, how long to fix it?

343
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,843
Not sure.

344
00:24:05,845 --> 00:24:07,878
The coolant isn't getting
to the engine block.

345
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,780
The lieutenant's gonna be
pissed if we show up late!

346
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,015
Yeah, I'm aware.

347
00:24:11,017 --> 00:24:12,616
All right, well, come on, Lucy.

348
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,485
We don't have much time
until nightfall.

349
00:24:14,487 --> 00:24:16,153
I know.

350
00:24:16,155 --> 00:24:17,922
All right, you heard the man.

351
00:24:17,924 --> 00:24:19,857
First team,
secure west perimeter.

352
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:21,759
Second team, take the east.

353
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:50,588
This is taking too long.

354
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,490
We should turn around.

355
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:53,824
We can come back in a few days.

356
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:57,228
Lily can't wait a few days.

357
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:59,063
I'm sorry.
I just don't see the math

358
00:24:59,065 --> 00:25:01,899
in risking eight lives for one!

359
00:25:01,901 --> 00:25:02,967
Sick kid or not.

360
00:25:02,969 --> 00:25:04,768
Let me put it this way.

361
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:07,037
What if Lily was your kid?

362
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,506
Your sick one in the bunker?

363
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:12,776
Because if we don't
succeed, it could be.

364
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:15,212
- Fuck!

365
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:19,116
Rotters!
Everybody in position!

366
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,520
- Lucy!
- Almost there.

367
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:23,787
Give me one more minute.

368
00:25:25,658 --> 00:25:26,891
Sounds like a swarm!

369
00:25:26,893 --> 00:25:28,158
Lucy, come on, we gotta go!

370
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,627
Hurry up!

371
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:32,530
Yes! I got it!

372
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:34,098
Everyone back
to the vehicles, now!

373
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,233
Move, move, move, move!

374
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:38,569
Go, go!

375
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,841
- Come on! Come on!
- Come on, come on, go!

376
00:25:43,843 --> 00:25:46,210
- Go! Now!

377
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:10,167
Team two,
give me a status report.

378
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:11,835
All clear.

379
00:26:11,837 --> 00:26:14,572
Looks like we lost them.
Over.

380
00:26:14,574 --> 00:26:17,942
Copy. Casualty report? Over.

381
00:26:17,944 --> 00:26:19,577
No casualties.

382
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:22,146
Looks like we dodged
a big one. Over.

383
00:26:22,148 --> 00:26:24,348
And not a moment too soon.

384
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,849
We're here, guys.

385
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:39,897
Lucy, Derek, Thomas,
you stay here.

386
00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:41,632
Everyone else on me.

387
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:48,806
Alphonse, go!

388
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,747
Right, then the first left.

389
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:03,954
Straight ahead.

390
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:05,756
Take a left at the end.

391
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:45,796
Clear.

392
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:48,032
Let's move.

393
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,250
Go!

394
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:24,802
Here.
This one on the left.

395
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:39,917
Clear.

396
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:42,920
Wow.

397
00:28:42,922 --> 00:28:44,354
These are vaccines,
these are antibiotics.

398
00:28:44,356 --> 00:28:45,956
- Grab those first.

399
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:00,404
Lucy, what's your sit-rep?

400
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:03,006
All clear out here. Over.

401
00:29:03,008 --> 00:29:04,942
Copy that. Stay put.
We'll be out in five.

402
00:29:04,944 --> 00:29:05,844
Yes, sir.

403
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:11,048
All right,
we got it. Let's go.

404
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:14,218
All right, people,
we gotta move.

405
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:07,898
- Where's Zoe?
- I don't know.

406
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,234
- Shots came from the south wing.
- Shit! Go, go!

407
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:48,105
Jesus, Zoe.

408
00:31:48,107 --> 00:31:49,907
What the hell happened?
Are you okay?

409
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:51,141
I'm fine. I'm fine.

410
00:31:51,143 --> 00:31:52,676
We need to move now.

411
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:57,247
Rotters are coming! Move!

412
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:58,949
Go!

413
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,457
I don't have a clear shot!

414
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,961
God! Aah!

415
00:32:10,963 --> 00:32:13,096
Come on, frank, let's go!

416
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:16,133
- Dear god, he's infected!
- Go!

417
00:32:16,135 --> 00:32:18,302
Get outta here! Go!

418
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:22,139
We got to move.

419
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,587
Go! Now! Move, move!

420
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,291
Baca, where's frank?

421
00:32:42,593 --> 00:32:44,428
He's gone! Get in!

422
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:49,099
Let's go! Move, move, move!

423
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:32,743
Go check the Humvees.

424
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:37,514
You're way fucking late, Baca.

425
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:40,250
We ran into some car trouble.

426
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:44,121
And we lost frank, too.

427
00:33:44,123 --> 00:33:45,622
He's dead.

428
00:33:45,624 --> 00:33:47,024
This is why we don't go on

429
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:48,725
wild fucking goose chase
supply runs.

430
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:51,061
- So people don't die for nothing.
- It wasn't for nothing!

431
00:33:51,063 --> 00:33:54,664
- We got the meds, Miguel.
- It's "lieutenant."

432
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:56,600
And you should have aborted the
minute you had vehicle problems.

433
00:33:56,602 --> 00:33:58,468
We needed to get the supplies.

434
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:01,738
Where's frank?

435
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:05,142
Why don't you tell her, Zoe?

436
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:12,516
I'm so sorry, Elle.

437
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:17,054
This is all on you!

438
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:20,590
It was your idea
to go out there!

439
00:35:06,805 --> 00:35:08,738
Hey, wait up!

440
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:11,408
All residents
return to the bunker now.

441
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:14,244
All residents return
to the bunker now.

442
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:20,717
All residents return
to the bunker.

443
00:35:22,354 --> 00:35:25,489
All residents
return to bunker now.

444
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:36,500
You didn't hear
the shift buzzer?

445
00:35:36,502 --> 00:35:38,435
I wanna look for my ball.

446
00:35:38,437 --> 00:35:40,637
I'll find it. You go inside.

447
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,522
Main gate now closing.

448
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:06,663
Sorry, thought I checked it.

449
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:08,165
Sorry's not gonna cut it

450
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:10,300
when there's rotters
up your ass.

451
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:45,669
We got it.

452
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:50,507
Hey, sweetie.

453
00:36:50,509 --> 00:36:52,909
You came back.

454
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:55,545
A promise is a promise.

455
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:01,651
This may taste a little gross,

456
00:37:01,653 --> 00:37:04,487
but you're a brave one, right?

457
00:37:08,593 --> 00:37:10,227
Just a little more.

458
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,295
Good girl.

459
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:20,337
Zoe.

460
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:22,606
Thank you.

461
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:26,710
Thank you so much.

462
00:37:26,712 --> 00:37:27,978
You're welcome.

463
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:42,892
Hey.

464
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:01,037
This is high rock
emergency bunker.

465
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:02,672
If anyone can hear this message,

466
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:04,708
please respond
on this frequency.

467
00:39:07,479 --> 00:39:09,446
This is high rock
emergency bunker.

468
00:39:09,448 --> 00:39:10,747
If anyone can hear this message,

469
00:39:10,749 --> 00:39:12,782
please respond
on this frequency.

470
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,720
This is high rock
emergency bunker.

471
00:39:16,722 --> 00:39:18,455
If anyone can hear
this message-

472
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,124
you wanted to see me?

473
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:23,960
Leave the room.

474
00:39:34,806 --> 00:39:36,906
I asked you here, Zoe,
because I think you and I

475
00:39:36,908 --> 00:39:38,675
have had somewhat
of a misunderstanding.

476
00:39:38,677 --> 00:39:41,010
Misunderstanding?

477
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,752
Don't you ever talk back
to me like that again

478
00:39:48,754 --> 00:39:49,853
in front of the others.

479
00:39:49,855 --> 00:39:51,421
I'm in charge here.

480
00:39:51,423 --> 00:39:52,922
My job is to keep
the people here safe,

481
00:39:52,924 --> 00:39:54,724
and I decide how that's done.

482
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:55,859
Understood?

483
00:39:57,428 --> 00:39:59,129
Yes...

484
00:39:59,131 --> 00:40:00,663
Lieutenant.

485
00:40:00,665 --> 00:40:02,465
You're dismissed.

486
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,602
Zoe, wait up.

487
00:41:12,604 --> 00:41:15,071
What did Miguel want?

488
00:41:15,073 --> 00:41:17,040
Why don't you ask him, Baca?

489
00:41:17,042 --> 00:41:18,074
He's your brother.

490
00:41:18,076 --> 00:41:19,776
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

491
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:22,879
Miguel shouldn't have blamed you

492
00:41:22,881 --> 00:41:24,714
for frank, all right?

493
00:41:24,716 --> 00:41:26,216
That's not on you.

494
00:41:26,218 --> 00:41:28,485
Frank knew the risks
we all take going outside.

495
00:41:28,487 --> 00:41:29,819
What's important

496
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:33,256
is that you saved Lily
and everyone else here.

497
00:41:33,258 --> 00:41:34,858
We're all thankful for it.

498
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:37,994
Thank you.

499
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:49,873
I should get back to work.

500
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:02,819
Fucking rats!

501
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:38,721
Please make sure
ration cards are stamped-

502
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:40,990
I was at the game.
I'm telling you,

503
00:42:40,992 --> 00:42:42,759
your pitchers
couldn't throw a fastball

504
00:42:42,761 --> 00:42:44,327
to save their lives.

505
00:42:44,329 --> 00:42:45,929
You need a strong bullpen

506
00:42:45,931 --> 00:42:47,730
to have a good baseball team.

507
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:49,165
I don't care what you say.

508
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:51,167
The Yankees were
the best ever, man.

509
00:42:51,169 --> 00:42:52,702
If it weren't for the rotters,

510
00:42:52,704 --> 00:42:54,037
hell, we would've
won the last season.

511
00:42:54,039 --> 00:42:55,171
Yeah, keep
telling yourself that.

512
00:42:55,173 --> 00:42:57,707
My rangers
woulda swept your guys.

513
00:42:57,709 --> 00:42:59,909
High rock's finest.

514
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:01,744
- Please make sure...
- Compliments of the chef.

515
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:03,012
...ration cards are stamped
by a station officer

516
00:43:03,014 --> 00:43:05,682
before proceeding to line.

517
00:43:05,684 --> 00:43:07,016
What the fuck is
with this line, Jeff?

518
00:43:07,018 --> 00:43:08,318
People got work details.

519
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,653
Sorry, I got off
to a late start this morning.

520
00:43:10,655 --> 00:43:12,355
Steve was supposed to come in
and fix the broken stove,

521
00:43:12,357 --> 00:43:15,692
but he hasn't shown up yet.

522
00:43:15,694 --> 00:43:17,894
Wendy, go talk
to your boyfriend.

523
00:43:17,896 --> 00:43:20,663
Tell him to come up here
and fix this stove immediately.

524
00:43:20,665 --> 00:43:21,931
Yes, sir.

525
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:27,804
Move it faster.

526
00:43:32,243 --> 00:43:33,743
Stevie?

527
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:37,680
Where are you, honey?

528
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:42,285
You're needed in the mess hall.

529
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:46,255
Sweetie?

530
00:43:47,858 --> 00:43:49,626
Miguel's pissed.

531
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:25,361
Help!

532
00:44:25,363 --> 00:44:26,829
Help!

533
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:28,665
Help! Help!

534
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:34,370
Hey, Lily. Jeremy.

535
00:44:34,372 --> 00:44:35,672
Hi, Zoe.

536
00:44:35,674 --> 00:44:36,973
It's past Lily's bedtime.

537
00:44:36,975 --> 00:44:38,174
She needs rest.

538
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:41,944
You can come back
tomorrow, okay?

539
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,348
- Bye, Lily.
- Bye.

540
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:46,949
Hey, sweetie.

541
00:44:46,951 --> 00:44:48,151
Hey.

542
00:44:50,954 --> 00:44:53,790
I wanted to give you this back.

543
00:44:53,792 --> 00:44:54,991
Oh, keep it.

544
00:44:54,993 --> 00:44:57,694
Looks better on you.

545
00:45:04,234 --> 00:45:06,069
Now go to sleep.

546
00:45:06,071 --> 00:45:09,205
Not before my mom comes
to say good night.

547
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:11,474
She'll be by
after her work shift.

548
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:15,778
Good night, sweetie.

549
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:16,879
Good night.

550
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:18,214
Sweet dreams.

551
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,314
Code red. Intruder alert.

552
00:45:51,316 --> 00:45:53,883
Code red.
Intruder alert.

553
00:45:53,885 --> 00:45:55,218
Alarm in the medical wing.

554
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:58,020
I repeat,
alarm in the medical wing. Go!

555
00:45:58,022 --> 00:45:59,455
Go, go, go!

556
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:02,759
Go!

557
00:46:07,464 --> 00:46:09,465
Oh, come on! No, no, no!

558
00:46:34,992 --> 00:46:36,826
Max?

559
00:46:36,828 --> 00:46:37,994
You recognize me?

560
00:46:37,996 --> 00:46:39,462
How are you still alive?

561
00:46:49,873 --> 00:46:50,773
Zoe!

562
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:54,443
Don't kill him!
He's not a rotter!

563
00:46:54,445 --> 00:46:55,511
Zoe, get out of the fucking way!

564
00:46:55,513 --> 00:46:56,813
Trust me!

565
00:46:56,815 --> 00:46:58,247
We need to catch him alive!

566
00:46:58,249 --> 00:46:59,515
Bullshit!
He's a one of them!

567
00:46:59,517 --> 00:47:01,117
No! He's not!

568
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,920
His name is Max!
He's a patient of mine!

569
00:47:03,922 --> 00:47:07,156
Baca! He's the breakthrough
I've been searching for!

570
00:47:19,236 --> 00:47:21,304
We got you now, motherfucker!

571
00:47:25,576 --> 00:47:27,109
What the hell?

572
00:47:27,111 --> 00:47:28,945
Are you all fucking crazy?

573
00:47:28,947 --> 00:47:30,880
- Why didn't you kill it?
- Wait.

574
00:47:30,882 --> 00:47:32,348
He's alive.

575
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:34,150
I need him for my research.

576
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:36,319
Looks like a rotter to me.

577
00:47:36,321 --> 00:47:38,888
Yes.

578
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:42,024
But we all know that
rotters always bite.

579
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:44,393
He had the chance to bite me
before, and he didn't.

580
00:47:45,929 --> 00:47:46,996
Prove it.

581
00:47:52,135 --> 00:47:53,903
Zoe, you don't have to do that.

582
00:48:26,503 --> 00:48:27,403
See?

583
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:30,539
It means his brain
is still working.

584
00:48:30,541 --> 00:48:33,075
He got the bite,
but something in his body

585
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:34,410
stopped him from turning.

586
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:35,945
He could be
the breakthrough we need

587
00:48:35,947 --> 00:48:37,046
in beating the rotter virus.

588
00:48:37,048 --> 00:48:38,915
You can't cure being a rotter.

589
00:48:38,917 --> 00:48:41,183
I'm not talking about a
cure for being a rotter.

590
00:48:41,185 --> 00:48:43,953
I'm talking about a vaccine
for the rest of us.

591
00:48:43,955 --> 00:48:46,022
A bite would no longer
be a death sentence.

592
00:48:47,491 --> 00:48:48,991
Please.

593
00:48:50,327 --> 00:48:51,560
Just give me a chance.

594
00:48:51,562 --> 00:48:53,696
This is all a bunch of bullshit.

595
00:48:53,698 --> 00:48:55,531
- Shoot it.
- Miguel, wait!

596
00:48:55,533 --> 00:48:57,934
If there's a chance
Zoe can do it,

597
00:48:57,936 --> 00:48:59,268
we should let her try.

598
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:03,005
This vaccine...

599
00:49:03,007 --> 00:49:04,507
Could've saved frank.

600
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,949
Fine. Do your tests.

601
00:49:12,951 --> 00:49:15,117
I want it locked up
at all times.

602
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:16,218
If there are any issues...

603
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:19,155
Put it the fuck down.

604
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:21,257
Yes, sir.

605
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:27,663
Only 12 hours
since Max has been restrained

606
00:49:27,665 --> 00:49:29,699
and placed under observation,

607
00:49:29,701 --> 00:49:32,435
and already high rock bunker
is divided up

608
00:49:32,437 --> 00:49:34,737
on their opinions
on what we should do with him.

609
00:49:34,739 --> 00:49:38,341
Miguel is looking
for any excuse he can find

610
00:49:38,343 --> 00:49:40,343
to put him down.

611
00:49:40,345 --> 00:49:44,013
With our current specimens
of rotters' blood running low,

612
00:49:44,015 --> 00:49:46,082
I need to acquire
additional samples

613
00:49:46,084 --> 00:49:48,117
to buy myself more time

614
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:50,686
to find scientific proof
Max is different.

615
00:49:52,022 --> 00:49:53,456
Max's vitals!

616
00:49:58,028 --> 00:49:59,695
Look at this.

617
00:49:59,697 --> 00:50:01,263
It's incredible.

618
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:06,035
Certain internal
and external parts are dead,

619
00:50:06,037 --> 00:50:09,271
while other parts
are still very much alive.

620
00:50:09,273 --> 00:50:11,240
His heart, his eyes, legs,

621
00:50:11,242 --> 00:50:12,675
and his cranial area,

622
00:50:12,677 --> 00:50:15,277
all still retaining
human function.

623
00:50:15,279 --> 00:50:16,579
Any clue as to why?

624
00:50:16,581 --> 00:50:17,713
No, not yet.

625
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:23,519
But I need to take
his blood sample.

626
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:27,456
We're breaking
protocol here, Zoe.

627
00:50:27,458 --> 00:50:29,692
He makes one wrong move,
I'm shooting him.

628
00:50:32,062 --> 00:50:33,162
Just relax, Max.

629
00:50:36,633 --> 00:50:38,134
You want me, right?

630
00:50:40,637 --> 00:50:42,104
Here I am.

631
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:47,343
Your Zoe.

632
00:50:48,779 --> 00:50:50,079
That's right.

633
00:50:52,482 --> 00:50:54,150
I know you came...

634
00:50:54,152 --> 00:50:55,684
All this way just for me.

635
00:51:09,299 --> 00:51:11,400
You like feeling my touch?

636
00:51:15,772 --> 00:51:17,506
Hey!

637
00:51:17,508 --> 00:51:20,076
I'm gonna blow your head off,
you piece of shit!

638
00:51:20,078 --> 00:51:22,445
No, don't, Elyse.

639
00:51:22,447 --> 00:51:23,646
I'm fine.

640
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:29,718
Zoe.

641
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:05,721
Hey.

642
00:52:11,261 --> 00:52:13,662
So what have you found?

643
00:52:13,664 --> 00:52:15,264
Based on
the blood sample I took,

644
00:52:15,266 --> 00:52:17,433
his hormone levels
are off the chart.

645
00:52:17,435 --> 00:52:20,369
I have never seen
anything like it.

646
00:52:20,371 --> 00:52:22,605
So you think that's
what stopped the virus?

647
00:52:22,607 --> 00:52:25,141
Well, possibly.

648
00:52:25,143 --> 00:52:26,475
But there are nine
hormonal glands,

649
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:27,843
and I don't know
which one it is.

650
00:52:27,845 --> 00:52:29,278
If I can find the source,

651
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,546
I might be able to extract it

652
00:52:30,548 --> 00:52:32,882
to produce a testable vaccine.

653
00:52:32,884 --> 00:52:35,818
Okay. All right,
so what do you need?

654
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:39,288
I need live virus samples
from living rotters.

655
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:42,458
Look, maybe we can round
some up from outside

656
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:43,759
to bring in for tests.

657
00:52:43,761 --> 00:52:46,162
No! Absolutely not.

658
00:52:46,164 --> 00:52:47,229
I mean, you know
how much I've risked

659
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:49,398
letting that thing stay here?

660
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,733
Look, I need the live samples

661
00:52:50,735 --> 00:52:52,401
to compare to Max's.

662
00:52:52,403 --> 00:52:54,837
It is the only way to know
which hormone it is.

663
00:52:54,839 --> 00:52:58,174
Please, Baca,
there must be a safer way.

664
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:06,782
The perimeter gate.

665
00:53:06,784 --> 00:53:09,718
We can use the doors
to file them in one by one

666
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:11,253
in a contained setting.

667
00:53:11,255 --> 00:53:12,855
Okay. When can we do it?

668
00:53:14,925 --> 00:53:16,525
Tonight.

669
00:53:19,896 --> 00:53:21,597
Main gate is now opening.

670
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:23,766
Nine-a,
prepare to initiate.

671
00:53:23,768 --> 00:53:25,568
Please stand clear.

672
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:28,537
All personnel
remain in your sector.

673
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:30,206
All right, team.

674
00:53:30,208 --> 00:53:32,241
We do this fast,
we do this efficiently.

675
00:53:32,243 --> 00:53:33,742
Nobody play hero here.

676
00:53:33,744 --> 00:53:35,644
We let in one rotter at a time.

677
00:53:35,646 --> 00:53:37,780
Bravo on the gate.
Alpha on the rotters.

678
00:53:37,782 --> 00:53:41,250
I don't want Zoe in there until
we have that rotter secured.

679
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:02,805
Let's go fishing.

680
00:54:02,807 --> 00:54:03,839
Let's do this.

681
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:14,283
Let them in one at a time.

682
00:54:14,285 --> 00:54:16,352
Weapons hot!

683
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:20,623
Ready!

684
00:54:21,725 --> 00:54:22,791
Go!

685
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,432
Derek, you're up!

686
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:31,800
Hold him still!

687
00:54:31,802 --> 00:54:33,435
All secured.

688
00:54:33,437 --> 00:54:34,337
Zoe!

689
00:54:37,374 --> 00:54:38,841
We got multiple bogies incoming!

690
00:54:38,843 --> 00:54:40,743
We need to hurry!

691
00:54:46,916 --> 00:54:47,983
Got it.

692
00:54:49,352 --> 00:54:50,653
Clear!

693
00:54:50,655 --> 00:54:52,621
Okay, we got the test sample!

694
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:53,889
Just one more!

695
00:54:56,993 --> 00:54:58,927
Go! Move!

696
00:54:58,929 --> 00:54:59,995
Move your fucking asses!

697
00:54:59,997 --> 00:55:01,063
Go, go, go!

698
00:55:02,667 --> 00:55:04,433
They're breaching!
Step away!

699
00:55:04,435 --> 00:55:06,802
What the hell is taking so long?

700
00:55:06,804 --> 00:55:08,537
- I got him.
- They're ready to breach!

701
00:55:08,539 --> 00:55:11,473
Fall back! Fall back!

702
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:13,842
Baca, the fence is buckling!

703
00:55:13,844 --> 00:55:15,611
We can't hold it!

704
00:55:15,613 --> 00:55:16,679
Run!

705
00:55:25,689 --> 00:55:26,789
Go, go, go, go!

706
00:55:27,791 --> 00:55:28,957
Go!

707
00:55:41,971 --> 00:55:43,505
Zoe.

708
00:55:53,851 --> 00:55:55,751
You think I'm scared of you?

709
00:55:55,753 --> 00:55:57,419
I've killed hundreds of you
fucking rotters.

710
00:55:57,421 --> 00:55:58,987
I can't wait
to put a bullet in you, too.

711
00:56:07,597 --> 00:56:08,697
She's your girlfriend.

712
00:56:12,736 --> 00:56:14,470
That conniving bitch.

713
00:56:17,941 --> 00:56:19,108
Commander, come quick!

714
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:20,709
Something's happening outside!

715
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:28,984
Initiating shutdown procedure.

716
00:56:28,986 --> 00:56:31,019
All personnel please fall back.

717
00:56:31,021 --> 00:56:34,056
- Get the gates!
- Move your fucking asses!

718
00:56:34,058 --> 00:56:36,392
Go faster!
They're right behind us!

719
00:56:37,794 --> 00:56:39,161
Go! Go! Go! Come on.

720
00:56:48,104 --> 00:56:50,539
How in the fuck did the rotters
get inside the perimeter fence?

721
00:56:53,810 --> 00:56:55,611
We were getting blood samples.

722
00:56:55,613 --> 00:56:56,645
You just let them in?

723
00:56:59,816 --> 00:57:01,617
What the fuck!

724
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:10,058
What the hell are you doing?

725
00:57:11,528 --> 00:57:13,729
My job. Protecting you people.

726
00:57:13,731 --> 00:57:16,799
Lieutenant, please.

727
00:57:16,801 --> 00:57:18,434
Zoe can help.

728
00:57:18,436 --> 00:57:20,068
It's too late.
There's nothing she can do.

729
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:21,203
It's not a head bite!
The infection takes time

730
00:57:21,205 --> 00:57:22,805
with a bite like hers!

731
00:57:22,807 --> 00:57:24,940
The vaccine can work
if it hasn't spread yet!

732
00:57:26,843 --> 00:57:29,011
Do you have the vaccine
right now?

733
00:57:32,916 --> 00:57:33,982
I didn't think so.

734
00:57:39,155 --> 00:57:41,156
Are you fucking insane?

735
00:57:41,158 --> 00:57:43,058
One bite, one bullet.

736
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:44,493
Just because you have a gun,

737
00:57:44,495 --> 00:57:45,694
it does not mean
you get to decide

738
00:57:45,696 --> 00:57:47,729
who lives and who fucking dies!

739
00:57:47,731 --> 00:57:49,064
Are you sure about that?

740
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,734
I thought I told you
to not talk back to me.

741
00:57:52,736 --> 00:57:54,803
Miguel.

742
00:57:54,805 --> 00:57:56,138
Put the gun down.

743
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:09,518
12 hours. Then I kill it.

744
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,854
Vaccine or no vaccine.

745
00:58:17,227 --> 00:58:19,761
Miguel! Wait up!

746
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:27,736
What the fuck was
that back there?

747
00:58:27,738 --> 00:58:29,805
Pointing a gun on Zoe like that?

748
00:58:29,807 --> 00:58:30,973
Are you out
of your fucking mind?

749
00:58:30,975 --> 00:58:32,641
No, I'm a commanding officer

750
00:58:32,643 --> 00:58:33,876
whose own fucking brother
went behind his back

751
00:58:33,878 --> 00:58:35,043
and put this whole place
in danger!

752
00:58:35,045 --> 00:58:36,745
Zoe needed those samples
for all of us,

753
00:58:36,747 --> 00:58:37,946
and you know that!

754
00:58:37,948 --> 00:58:39,581
So you follow her orders now?

755
00:58:39,583 --> 00:58:41,183
Let me remind you
who's in charge!

756
00:58:41,185 --> 00:58:43,752
Not her, not you,
not anybody else.

757
00:58:43,754 --> 00:58:45,521
Miguel, you're cracking!

758
00:58:45,523 --> 00:58:47,689
I get it, but that
back there was bullshit!

759
00:58:47,691 --> 00:58:49,658
No, I'm the only one
thinking rationally.

760
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:52,094
Everyone's chasing her empty
promises about this vaccine.

761
00:58:52,096 --> 00:58:53,896
I'm your brother, Baca.

762
00:58:53,898 --> 00:58:55,564
Your own flesh and blood.

763
00:58:55,566 --> 00:58:58,100
Believe me when I tell you
she's fooling you.

764
00:58:58,102 --> 00:59:00,769
Don't you see what she's doing?

765
00:59:00,771 --> 00:59:02,905
Why do you think she keeps
this thing alive?

766
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,974
What are you trying to say?

767
00:59:05,976 --> 00:59:08,176
That rotter has her name
engraved on his arm.

768
00:59:08,178 --> 00:59:09,811
Wake up, Baca!

769
01:00:12,175 --> 01:00:13,775
I'm sorry about Elyse.

770
01:00:15,845 --> 01:00:17,179
I know you two were close.

771
01:00:19,048 --> 01:00:20,315
Thanks, Baca.

772
01:00:29,025 --> 01:00:32,027
Zoe, I need you to tell me that
you can really do this vaccine.

773
01:00:36,199 --> 01:00:38,166
You losing faith in me?

774
01:00:38,168 --> 01:00:41,103
Of course not.

775
01:00:41,105 --> 01:00:42,371
It's just...

776
01:00:44,907 --> 01:00:46,141
I mean, you don't get it.

777
01:00:47,944 --> 01:00:50,112
Thomas, Elyse...

778
01:00:50,114 --> 01:00:54,016
I ordered them
out there for you,

779
01:00:54,018 --> 01:00:55,117
for your vaccine.

780
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:56,652
And they died.

781
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:00,656
You're blaming me?

782
01:01:00,658 --> 01:01:02,124
Do you really think
I would risk their lives

783
01:01:02,126 --> 01:01:02,124
if I didn't think
it was worth it?

784
01:01:02,126 --> 01:01:05,427
Honestly, I don't know what
to believe with you right now.

785
01:01:05,429 --> 01:01:06,995
What the fuck does that mean?

786
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:09,665
What the fuck
is that thing to you?

787
01:01:09,667 --> 01:01:13,669
That thing has your name
carved into his forearm.

788
01:01:19,442 --> 01:01:22,778
You're hiding something
from me, Zoe.

789
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:24,346
So I need you to tell me.

790
01:01:27,316 --> 01:01:29,051
Who was that thing to you?

791
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:34,956
He was a fucking psycho...

792
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:37,359
Who tried to rape me.

793
01:01:38,961 --> 01:01:40,862
Tried to take
what he wanted from me.

794
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:44,833
That's who he was.

795
01:01:47,403 --> 01:01:49,471
There.

796
01:01:49,473 --> 01:01:50,906
You happy now?

797
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:54,276
Do you feel better?

798
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:57,279
Why didn't you just tell me?

799
01:01:57,281 --> 01:01:58,346
Because...

800
01:01:59,982 --> 01:02:01,283
Every time...

801
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:04,286
I talk,

802
01:02:04,288 --> 01:02:06,321
think...

803
01:02:06,323 --> 01:02:07,355
Or look at him...

804
01:02:09,292 --> 01:02:13,061
I have to relive the worst
fucking day of my life.

805
01:02:15,832 --> 01:02:17,299
Right now,
I just need you to trust me

806
01:02:17,301 --> 01:02:19,000
and believe in me, Baca.

807
01:02:22,839 --> 01:02:24,473
And if you can't...

808
01:02:28,478 --> 01:02:30,245
I'll go it alone.

809
01:03:24,267 --> 01:03:26,835
Uh...

810
01:03:26,837 --> 01:03:30,372
Let's drink tonight for those
who are no longer here.

811
01:03:30,374 --> 01:03:32,174
To frank.

812
01:03:32,176 --> 01:03:34,309
Loving husband.

813
01:03:34,311 --> 01:03:36,411
Well, you know,
here's to Thomas,

814
01:03:36,413 --> 01:03:39,915
a guy that made each one of us
a better person.

815
01:03:39,917 --> 01:03:41,383
And to Elyse.

816
01:03:41,385 --> 01:03:42,517
I'll miss her dearly.

817
01:03:46,389 --> 01:03:48,089
To friends.

818
01:03:48,091 --> 01:03:49,257
- To friends.
- Friends

819
01:04:04,574 --> 01:04:06,875
hey, doc.

820
01:04:06,877 --> 01:04:08,610
Figured you could use this.

821
01:04:08,612 --> 01:04:10,545
I know you been going
at it a while.

822
01:04:10,547 --> 01:04:12,113
Thanks, Alphonse.

823
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:23,992
Man, you're ugly.

824
01:04:25,128 --> 01:04:27,229
Don't get too close.

825
01:04:29,165 --> 01:04:31,132
The lieutenant is right,

826
01:04:31,134 --> 01:04:33,235
we should just kill
this slippery fuck.

827
01:04:33,237 --> 01:04:34,302
Stand down, Lucy.

828
01:04:36,405 --> 01:04:37,472
Max!

829
01:04:41,444 --> 01:04:43,411
Did he bite you?

830
01:04:43,413 --> 01:04:44,613
I don't think so.

831
01:04:49,585 --> 01:04:51,653
No, you're good.
He didn't get you.

832
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:55,957
Lucy, you need to get some
ice on that head wound.

833
01:04:55,959 --> 01:04:57,292
Al, take her down
to the med ward.

834
01:04:57,294 --> 01:04:58,426
Come with me.

835
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:13,508
One day...

836
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:17,612
And you're back trying
to fuck up my life again.

837
01:05:22,652 --> 01:05:25,487
Zoe.

838
01:05:35,698 --> 01:05:36,998
What?

839
01:05:51,681 --> 01:05:53,081
You're nothing...

840
01:05:55,017 --> 01:05:56,084
But filth.

841
01:05:57,687 --> 01:06:02,691
You are mine.

842
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:48,503
Zoe!

843
01:06:48,505 --> 01:06:49,671
Shut up!

844
01:06:55,278 --> 01:06:58,013
I have had enough of this!

845
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:02,584
I know what you're trying to do,
and it is not going to work.

846
01:07:02,586 --> 01:07:05,053
I only have a few hours
to stop this virus,

847
01:07:05,055 --> 01:07:08,156
and nothing you say or do
is going to fucking stop me!

848
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:23,071
Commencement of testing
for patient 15009,

849
01:07:23,073 --> 01:07:24,472
Max.

850
01:07:24,474 --> 01:07:26,808
Beginning with current
hypothesis of samples.

851
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:29,411
Homo sapiens blood
and anomaly cells...

852
01:07:29,413 --> 01:07:32,247
Otherwise known
as rotter's blood.

853
01:07:32,249 --> 01:07:34,416
Current tests show
that homo sapiens blood,

854
01:07:34,418 --> 01:07:35,784
despite the different amounts,

855
01:07:35,786 --> 01:07:38,820
all react consistently
with our tests.

856
01:07:38,822 --> 01:07:40,789
The virus shows no signs
of letting up.

857
01:07:40,791 --> 01:07:45,260
It has, and always will,
infect us at alarming rates.

858
01:07:45,262 --> 01:07:47,796
Patient 15009's blood, however,

859
01:07:47,798 --> 01:07:49,564
shows signs of dormant activity

860
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:51,433
within all human blood cells.

861
01:07:51,435 --> 01:07:54,602
They appear to coexist
without any signs of threat

862
01:07:54,604 --> 01:07:57,605
or exigency
to our living blood samples.

863
01:07:57,607 --> 01:08:00,842
Despite the fact the idea
of his blood in anybody,

864
01:08:00,844 --> 01:08:03,111
let alone mine, is nauseating,

865
01:08:03,113 --> 01:08:06,381
this is critical
for my hypothesis for the cure.

866
01:08:06,383 --> 01:08:08,850
So here comes
the moment of truth.

867
01:08:08,852 --> 01:08:12,120
Testing patient 15009's blood

868
01:08:12,122 --> 01:08:14,489
against the anomaly
rotter cells.

869
01:08:14,491 --> 01:08:17,692
If this works,
patient 15009's blood

870
01:08:17,694 --> 01:08:20,328
can be effectively engaged
in our bloodstream

871
01:08:20,330 --> 01:08:24,399
to kill off any rotter cells
before it spreads.

872
01:08:24,401 --> 01:08:26,601
Patient 15009's blood

873
01:08:26,603 --> 01:08:28,837
is the answer to destroying
the rotter cells

874
01:08:28,839 --> 01:08:31,206
in infected bodies.

875
01:08:31,208 --> 01:08:33,274
If we aren't too late.

876
01:08:35,878 --> 01:08:36,878
Baca?

877
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:38,213
Come down here right now.

878
01:08:45,522 --> 01:08:48,523
You are mine.

879
01:08:58,167 --> 01:08:59,400
Oh, hey.

880
01:08:59,402 --> 01:09:00,568
Zoe, Zoe, what's the matter?

881
01:09:00,570 --> 01:09:02,337
It's Max, he's free.

882
01:09:02,339 --> 01:09:03,705
- Where is he?
- In the med lab.

883
01:09:03,707 --> 01:09:05,573
- Let's go!
- No head shots!

884
01:09:05,575 --> 01:09:06,875
I need him alive!

885
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:15,350
- Fuck!
- Shit!

886
01:09:15,352 --> 01:09:16,651
Sound the alarm.
We need everyone

887
01:09:16,653 --> 01:09:18,520
to get back
to the township, now!

888
01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:22,257
- Emergency.

889
01:09:22,259 --> 01:09:23,491
All military personnel

890
01:09:23,493 --> 01:09:25,293
please report to your squadron.

891
01:09:25,295 --> 01:09:26,895
Civilians are advised

892
01:09:26,897 --> 01:09:29,597
to remain secured
in the township.

893
01:09:29,599 --> 01:09:32,367
Emergency.
All civilians are advised

894
01:09:32,369 --> 01:09:34,936
to remain secured
in the township.

895
01:09:34,938 --> 01:09:36,871
All residents to the township.

896
01:09:36,873 --> 01:09:40,842
I repeat. Everyone report
to the township immediately.

897
01:09:40,844 --> 01:09:42,343
- This is not a drill.

898
01:09:42,345 --> 01:09:44,879
I repeat, this is not a drill.

899
01:10:01,330 --> 01:10:03,231
Lily!

900
01:10:03,233 --> 01:10:04,532
Get everyone to the township!

901
01:10:04,534 --> 01:10:05,600
I'll meet you there!

902
01:10:05,602 --> 01:10:06,668
Be careful!

903
01:10:06,670 --> 01:10:08,570
I'll be okay!

904
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:27,755
Mom?

905
01:10:29,725 --> 01:10:31,359
Mom?

906
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:41,936
Oh, my god, Lily!
What are you doing out here?

907
01:10:41,938 --> 01:10:43,438
She's coming!

908
01:10:56,385 --> 01:10:57,518
Mommy, no!

909
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:58,786
Please don't!

910
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:04,892
What's wrong?
What's going on?

911
01:11:04,894 --> 01:11:06,294
Is something happening?

912
01:11:06,296 --> 01:11:07,929
- What do we do?
- Is it the rotters?

913
01:11:07,931 --> 01:11:09,397
- Why are the alarm-
- quiet! Calm down, all right?

914
01:11:09,399 --> 01:11:10,999
Baca, is something happening?

915
01:11:11,001 --> 01:11:12,367
What the hell happened?

916
01:11:14,603 --> 01:11:16,838
It's the rotter.

917
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:18,373
He's loose inside the complex.

918
01:11:24,847 --> 01:11:26,581
Don't worry. Everyone
go back to your bed.

919
01:11:26,583 --> 01:11:28,316
Everything's under control.

920
01:11:28,318 --> 01:11:29,984
Lieutenant,
something is not right.

921
01:11:29,986 --> 01:11:31,719
- We need to know.
- Please, everything's okay.

922
01:11:31,721 --> 01:11:33,021
Just go back to your homes.

923
01:11:41,363 --> 01:11:43,531
You happy now, Baca?

924
01:11:43,533 --> 01:11:45,767
I told you not to trust Zoe.

925
01:11:45,769 --> 01:11:47,935
- Find that rotter, kill it.
- No, we need to take it alive.

926
01:11:47,937 --> 01:11:49,370
There's a chance we can
still get that vaccine.

927
01:11:49,372 --> 01:11:50,805
Everyone that fails
to comply to my orders

928
01:11:50,807 --> 01:11:52,473
will be executed on the spot.

929
01:11:52,475 --> 01:11:54,742
We got a problem
in the motor pool.

930
01:11:54,744 --> 01:11:55,877
Guards aren't responding.

931
01:11:55,879 --> 01:11:57,412
Okay, we gotta get
to the motor pool.

932
01:11:57,414 --> 01:11:58,813
Lucy, Alphonse, stay here,
protect the people.

933
01:11:58,815 --> 01:12:00,548
- Everyone else on me!
- Copy that!

934
01:12:07,856 --> 01:12:10,325
Lily.

935
01:13:10,619 --> 01:13:11,819
Let her go.

936
01:13:13,155 --> 01:13:15,857
Zoe.

937
01:13:17,092 --> 01:13:18,693
Let her go, Max.

938
01:13:21,431 --> 01:13:22,697
I...

939
01:13:24,833 --> 01:13:27,568
Came for you.

940
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:29,971
You...

941
01:13:29,973 --> 01:13:33,174
Need me.

942
01:13:34,443 --> 01:13:35,777
You want me alive...

943
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:40,715
Let her go.

944
01:13:40,717 --> 01:13:42,049
No!

945
01:13:45,187 --> 01:13:46,954
Okay, okay.

946
01:13:48,657 --> 01:13:50,925
Now.

947
01:14:07,010 --> 01:14:08,843
Main gate is now opening.

948
01:14:11,613 --> 01:14:12,747
Aah!

949
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:19,821
Let's go now!

950
01:14:27,896 --> 01:14:29,530
No! No!

951
01:14:36,872 --> 01:14:37,972
Lily!

952
01:14:40,676 --> 01:14:42,009
Zoe!

953
01:14:57,192 --> 01:14:58,626
Zoe!

954
01:15:07,769 --> 01:15:09,003
Move! Move! Move! Move!

955
01:15:16,211 --> 01:15:18,012
Aah!

956
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:25,720
Lieutenant,

957
01:15:25,722 --> 01:15:27,655
what's the report
on the motor pool?

958
01:15:32,562 --> 01:15:35,596
Lieutenant, do you read me?

959
01:15:35,598 --> 01:15:37,532
- Fuck!

960
01:15:50,579 --> 01:15:51,646
Shannon!

961
01:16:29,152 --> 01:16:30,718
Cover me!
I'm going to close the door!

962
01:16:40,996 --> 01:16:42,964
Miguel, open that fucking door!

963
01:16:42,966 --> 01:16:44,632
Lily and Zoe are still outside!

964
01:16:44,634 --> 01:16:46,267
I don't give a fuck!

965
01:16:46,269 --> 01:16:47,768
The rotters got in
because of that bitch Zoe.

966
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:48,903
That door stays closed.

967
01:16:48,905 --> 01:16:49,904
I am not leaving them outside!

968
01:16:49,906 --> 01:16:51,272
Stand down, Baca.

969
01:16:51,274 --> 01:16:53,207
So what,

970
01:16:53,209 --> 01:16:55,176
you're gonna shoot
your own brother now?

971
01:16:55,178 --> 01:16:56,711
I will if I have to.

972
01:16:59,881 --> 01:17:01,115
Don't make me do it.

973
01:17:08,390 --> 01:17:09,957
Miguel!

974
01:17:41,290 --> 01:17:43,924
Main gate is now opening.

975
01:17:43,926 --> 01:17:45,726
Please stand clear.

976
01:17:45,728 --> 01:17:47,395
Main gate is now opening.

977
01:17:47,397 --> 01:17:48,896
Please stand clear.

978
01:17:58,707 --> 01:17:59,740
Lily!

979
01:18:02,778 --> 01:18:04,011
Sweetie, are you okay?

980
01:18:04,013 --> 01:18:05,279
Yeah.

981
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:08,382
Here, come on.

982
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:11,919
In here, sweetie.

983
01:19:26,962 --> 01:19:29,797
Zoe.

984
01:19:44,513 --> 01:19:47,114
You are...

985
01:19:47,116 --> 01:19:49,416
Mine!

986
01:19:49,418 --> 01:19:52,319
No. You're mine,
motherfucker!

987
01:19:55,557 --> 01:19:56,791
Come on, lil.

988
01:20:22,951 --> 01:20:24,218
Baca, don't!

989
01:20:37,399 --> 01:20:38,899
It's too late.

990
01:20:40,068 --> 01:20:43,003
I can feel it in my body.

991
01:20:45,207 --> 01:20:47,942
It's turning me.

992
01:20:47,944 --> 01:20:50,511
You haven't fully turned yet.

993
01:20:50,513 --> 01:20:53,414
The vaccine can still work.

994
01:20:53,416 --> 01:20:54,515
No.

995
01:20:57,152 --> 01:20:59,420
I don't wanna be
one of those things, Zoe.

996
01:20:59,422 --> 01:21:01,288
Baca, please.

997
01:21:03,925 --> 01:21:06,460
- I'm sorry.
- I can stop the virus.

998
01:21:10,098 --> 01:21:11,365
Believe me.

999
01:21:13,235 --> 01:21:15,402
I can stop the virus.

1000
01:21:16,571 --> 01:21:18,339
You just have to trust me.

1001
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:23,577
I love you, Baca.

1002
01:21:38,293 --> 01:21:41,161
I've used up what I could
from patient-

1003
01:21:41,163 --> 01:21:43,964
from Max's blood on Baca.

1004
01:21:43,966 --> 01:21:45,532
I could only dispense so much

1005
01:21:45,534 --> 01:21:47,268
as I need the remaining samples

1006
01:21:47,270 --> 01:21:49,370
to create
a mass production schedule

1007
01:21:49,372 --> 01:21:52,172
for the antivirus.

1008
01:21:52,174 --> 01:21:54,041
I dislike the idea that Baca

1009
01:21:54,043 --> 01:21:56,076
is technically and conveniently

1010
01:21:56,078 --> 01:21:58,679
my first human test subject.

1011
01:21:58,681 --> 01:22:01,315
This will speed things up
in getting the antivirus

1012
01:22:01,317 --> 01:22:03,918
into mass production
for everybody.

1013
01:22:18,333 --> 01:22:20,034
To everybody out there,

1014
01:22:20,036 --> 01:22:22,036
to anyone who is listening,

1015
01:22:22,038 --> 01:22:25,372
I'm broadcasting this from
high rock emergency bunker.

1016
01:22:25,374 --> 01:22:27,107
Our doors are open.

1017
01:22:27,109 --> 01:22:29,410
We have an inoculation
against the rotter bite,

1018
01:22:29,412 --> 01:22:33,347
a vaccine that will keep anyone
who takes it from turning.

1019
01:22:35,016 --> 01:22:38,185
From now on,
when you greet the day,

1020
01:22:38,187 --> 01:22:41,021
know this world is not
as dangerous as it used to be.

1021
01:22:42,457 --> 01:22:44,325
Things are changing.

1022
01:22:44,327 --> 01:22:47,494
And while we can't put
the world back,

1023
01:22:47,496 --> 01:22:50,030
there's still beauty in it.

1024
01:22:51,633 --> 01:22:54,301
There's still hope
that we can be safe

1025
01:22:56,271 --> 01:23:00,307
and that it's okay for us
to let our guard down now,

1026
01:23:00,309 --> 01:23:01,642
to be happy...

1027
01:23:03,478 --> 01:23:04,645
And to love.
