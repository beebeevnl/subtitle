1
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
After everything we’ve seen,

2
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,000
there isn’t much that rattles either of us anymore.

3
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,100
But this one..

4
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,700
this one still haunts me.

5
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,800
Two months prior 
to our involvement,

6
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,900
the Lutz family had fled 
their home in the middle of the night

7
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,400
claiming that the house was haunted.

8
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,400
The Church had reached 
out to us for help.

9
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,800
They wanted to see if we could
confirm the activity

10
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,800
that had been reported by the Lutz.

11
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,100
Okay, are you ready?

12
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,400
Then let's get started.

13
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,200
I’d like you to sit quietly 
and close your eyes.

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,800
Envision yourself in a halo of 
glowing white light.

15
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,100
It will protect you.

16
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,200
The year before the Lutz
moved in,

17
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,100
a young man named Ronnie DeFeo,

18
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,300
had brutally murdered his
entire family in this house.

19
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,500
We hoped to discover 
if the killings

20
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,300
had been motivated purely by anger

21
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,600
or if, 

22
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,100
as Ronnie DeFeo testified in court, 

23
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,500
he had been under the influence 
of something demonic.

24
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,200
What did you do?

25
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,300
What did you do?

26
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,400
(whispering) Shoot, shoot, shoot..

27
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,100
Honey, are you okay?
What are you seeing?

28
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,700
Lorraine!

29
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,500
Lorraine, what is happening?

30
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,200
- I have to see.
- We’re through.

31
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,400
We’re through.
It's time to come back.

32
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,400
What is happening?

33
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,200
He wants to show me.

34
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,400
Lorraine! Lorraine!

35
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,400
Honey? Honey?

36
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,900
Honey?

37
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,100
It’s okay.

38
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,300
It’s okay.

39
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,000
This is as close to hell as 
I’ll ever want to get.

40
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,300
Kit and I are going to sneak 
outside with his friend Michael.

41
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,500
He wants to meet you, by the way.

42
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:10,600
No way. If my momma ever 
found out, I’d be dead!

43
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,600
So then don’t get caught, you priest.

44
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,900
Hey, hold this.

45
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,900
Gonna give you back the spirit board
that we made.

46
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,100
I think I'll let Kit
french-kissed me.

47
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,700
What? No way!

48
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,500
What you two doing?

49
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,100
Janet, give that to me!

50
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,600
And get inside, both of you.
Go!

51
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,000
Ma-Ma-Ma-Margaret...

52
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,900
Margaret! Johnny!

53
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,200
Janet! Billy!

54
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,400
Hello, how was your day?

55
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Not good.

56
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,300
Why? What happened?

57
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,500
It's a long story,
I’ll tell you later.

58
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,800
All right then.

59
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,200
Wh-wh-what’s up,
Bi-Bi-Bi-Billy?

60
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,400
Shut up, Peter!

61
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,300
- Lesbo.
- What, are you're talking about your mom?

62
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,700
- Thank you Camilla.
- No problem.

63
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,100
He’s just a wanker, ignore him.

64
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,000
K—K-K- Kay…

65
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,500
ENFIELD ELEMENTARY

66
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,400
GREEN STREET

67
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,400
HODGSON RESIDENCE
ENFIELD, ENGLAND - 1977

68
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,800
I cannot pay my rent this month.

69
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,300
You have to..

70
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,100
No, I talked to them,
and they put me through to you.

71
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,800
I am being calm!

72
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,700
Well I don’t understand
why you can’t help me.

73
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,500
No! He has not paid a penny 
at all 
for maintenance in three months.

74
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,800
We're home!

75
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,600
- Owh I see, that's bloody brilliant.
- Hi Mom!

76
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,200
Thank you, good afternoon as well.

77
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,700
Janet...

78
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,600
As things weren’t bad enough for me,

79
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,000
I got a call from your headmistress,

80
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I wasn’t. I
wasn’t smoking,

81
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,500
- I promise.
- Did you get the biscuits?

82
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,500
Did you just not hear me? I talked 
to Mrs. Moore on the telephone,

83
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,800
How you can stand there and lie to me like that!

84
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,600
- I'm not lying!
- Yes, she is!

85
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,300
It’s all over the school.

86
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,400
She was smoking with Camilla.

87
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,500
Shut up, you're such 
a liar Johnny!

88
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,300
Mom, you-you said...

89
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,200
No Billy, I did not get
the bloody biscuits…

90
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,800
cause I don’t even have money!

91
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,300
Mom’s coming.

92
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,600
Quit messing with that
and brush your teeth.

93
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,300
All right.

94
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,900
Sounds like the whole city 
is burning down in here.

95
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,800
- Look what I found?
- Biscuits!

96
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,800
But-but you-you said,
we don’t have any money?

97
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,700
Well, I’ve been meaning 
to quit smoking anyway.

98
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,900
- Margaret?
- Yes?

99
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,400
You got your school
uniform for tomorrow?

100
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,200
Yes Mom, I'm getting it.

101
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,900
- Johnny, brush your teeth
- I did already.

102
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,200
Come on, Billy.
Time for bed.

103
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,400
I'm coming mom.

104
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,500
Whoah, where'd that come from?

105
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,400
Camilla and I 
made it at school.

106
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,900
That… doesn’t look right.

107
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,400
It really works, I swear.

108
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,500
We already asked it all sorts of stuff.

109
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,100
Come on, I'll show you.

110
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,200
All right.

111
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,500
What should I ask?

112
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,700
I don’t know. 
Whatever what you want.

113
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,000
Okay.

114
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,200
My sister and I want to know,

115
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,200
are there any spirits here that 

116
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,900
Is dad ever coming home?

117
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,000
Are there any spirits here 

118
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,700
Don’t worry about it.

119
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,700
It’s just a stupid game,
it isn’t real.

120
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,200
- Ugh, why’d you pounding on the door?
- No.

121
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,700
You balmy.

122
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,800
She said she wasn’t smoking!

123
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,100
I don’t mean to 
agonise over it, Peg.

124
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,200
Gods knows, are you shared 
a fag in school, didn’t you?

125
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,200
Oh, lots.

126
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,600
It’s not what she
did that bothers me.

127
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,900
She doesn’t listen to
what I say anymore, Pegs.

128
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,200
Just a phase, ain’t it?

129
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,900
I mean, I could punish her, but then I’ll feel guilty

130
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,600
because I know It’s not really her fault.

131
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,200
She loves her dad.

132
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,000
And she took it very hard
when he left, poor thing.

133
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,100
But I can’t just let it go
either, can’t I?

134
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,000
I’m loathed to ask, but have you 
told Richard about it?

135
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,600
I would, if I ever saw him.

136
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,000
Sod.

137
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,100
Now it’s like I’m having to do both jobs,

138
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,400
I'm half the mom I was 
before, I'm just…

139
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,800
rubbish, Peggy.

140
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,900
<P> You’re not, Peggy. Don’t 
be too hard on yourself.

141
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,000
Please stop it now!

142
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:16,500
We’re back with real life Ghost Hunters,

143
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,900
Ed and Lorraine Warren,

144
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,300
talking about their experiences
at the Amityville house.

145
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,500
And now we’re gonna talk to 
my next guest, 
Dr. Steven Kaplan,

146
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,000
who says that the investigations 

147
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,300
the Warrens conducted into 

148
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,400
is a load of hogwash.

149
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,500
Why is that?

150
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:38,200
Well, it’s been well established that
Amityville was a blatant hoax.

151
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,600
Well, it has never been proven.

152
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,600
Yes it has!

153
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,600
The Lutz family made everything up
so they can profit off of all the publicity.

154
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,600
That's just not true!

155
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,000
Look, we see this
all the time.

156
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,900
It's very easy to
sit on the outside,

157
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,300
and pick apart their story.

158
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,100
But it’s something very different to have 

159
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:59,000
I don’t need to go to the moon to know
that is not made out of "green cheese".

160
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,200
Listen, Ed Warren’s
never seen a house

161
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,900
that he didn’t think was haunted.

162
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,800
By the time his wife is done

163
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,600
blowing smoke and ringing bells

164
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,900
they got everybody else to believing in ghosts too.

165
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,300
What exactly you are doctor of anyway?

166
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,700
Come on Warren, try and show
a little class, will you?

167
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,800
I'm not going to show
class with somebody

168
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,600
who is sitting here telling 
lies about my wife and me.

169
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,000
Be very careful who you call a liar!

170
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,100
What are you gonna do about it?

171
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,800
We go on these shows
to inform people.

172
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,100
But every time I open my mouth,

173
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,100
- another one of those little ass..
- Ed!

174

175
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:34,000
pops out, try to undo 
everything we’ve done.

176
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,000
- Could you please take a breath?
- I know, I know..

177
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,200
I know, I'm counting to ten,

178
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,500
counting to ten.

179
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,500
Alright Billy, you ready
to do a speech?

180
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,100
<i> The Crooked Man </i>

It’s all right. 

185
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,000
Ready?

186
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
<i> ? He found a crooked six pence… </i>

192
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,700
Good boy!

193
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,400
You are getting so good.

194
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,500
- Now you may have a biscuit. 

195
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,000
Alright, come one.

196
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,300
Off to bed with ya.

197
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,200
- Good night mom.
- Good night darling.

198
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,000
Now don’t eat too many of those, or you’ll

won’t.

201
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,500
You promise?

202
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,400
- Alright, boys.
- Good night, Mom.

203
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,500
No.

204
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,500
Help.

205
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,500
Please stop.

- Janet.
- Please!

207
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,800

<i> Playing a game with Billy. </i>

214

00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,900
Janet, who are you talking to?

216
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,500
You have to go away!

217

- You're the one trespassing! 
- Janet, wake up!

218
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,400
I'll tell my mother
if you don’t stop.

- No!

No!

Hey Janet?

224
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,100
- It’s all right.

225
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,100
It’s okay.

226
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,400
Go back to sleep.

Stay away from me!

228
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,900
Leave us alone! 
Do you hear me?

229
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,100
Shut up. What are you doing?
There's no one here!

Billy, what's wrong?

233
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,300
- There-there’s someone in my tent!
- What?

234
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,100
There-there’s someone in my te-tent!

235
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,600
You see? Nothing. 
You just had a bad dream.

236
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,800
That's all.

237
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,000

238
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,400

Janet!

240
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,800
You nearly gave me a heart attack. 

241
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,700
I think I’ve been
sleepwalking again.

242
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,100
What do you mean again?

243
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,400
Are you all right?

244
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,600
You are burning out.

245
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,000
Come on. Let's get 
you back upstairs, eh?

246
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,400
I think it’s best you don’t
go to school tomorrow.

247
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,600
Come on. Let’s get
you back in bed, eh?

00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,400
Hi Mom.

250
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,300
Yeah, a little.

251
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,200
I just had some, 
I’m not 
really that hungry.

252
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,400
Yeah, I'm here.

253
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,400
Do you know when you’ll be home?

254
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,400
Right. 
Bye, Mom.

My house!

256
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,100
You're up early.

257
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,600
Yeah, I couldn’t sleep.

258
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,500
- Are you inspired?
- I wouldn’t call it that.

259
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,200
I had this crazy dream.

260
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,900
I saw this thing. 
When I woke up,

261
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,600
couldn’t get it out of my head, so..

262
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,900
I thought maybe this might help.

263
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,900
Hey, I know I'm no Picasso, 

264
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,100
but didn’t think it was that bad.

265
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,300
We need to stop.

266
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:26,300
We could still do the 
lectures but, no new cases.

267
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,400
At least not for a little while.

268
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,000
All right.

269
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,900
Could I ask why?

270
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,100
Because if it’s the tv shows

271
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,400
we won’t do that.

272
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,800
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

273
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,500
Morning.

274
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,900
Do you trust me?

275
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,900
You know I do.

276
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,100
Then please trust me now.

277
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,800
Okay.

278
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,900
What’d you doing that for?

279
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,800
In case if I’m 
sleep walking again.

280
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,500
Mom?

281
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,700
Johnny?

282
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,100
Janet, what’s wrong?
What is it?

283
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,600
There's someone in the room!

284
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,300
There is no one.
What you're talking about?

285
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,500
Mom! There's someone 
in our room!

286
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,800
The bed is shaking
up and down.

287
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,900
Janet, I swear to God if 
you’re making these up!

288
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,600
He bit me! 
Look!

Oh my God!

00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,800
You two been playing with this?

291
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,500
Taking turns, scaring the 
wits out of each other?

292
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,200
No wonder I can’t get good night’s sleep!

293
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:48,900
But Mom...

294
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,700
No, I do not want to hear another word!

295
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,600
Now get back to bed
the lot of you!

<i> NOTTINGHAM'S RESIDENCE </i>

297
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,800
I seen it with my own eyes.

298
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,400
That bloody thing went
clear across the room.

299
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,300
- What?
- Well?

300
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,300
It was cold. I’ve been 
through the house.

301
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:23,400
From top to bottom, 
there’s no one there.

302
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,800
What about Margaret 
and 
Janet’s room? Did you…

303
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,300
Yes, I gone there. Every room.

304
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,000
Even went down the basement.

305
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,000
What he's doing?

306
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Oh. We taught him to ring the bell,
when he wants to go.

307
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,600
Do you want to let him out, Billy?

308
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,000
Lo-lo-look!

309
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,000
Po-police are at our house.

310
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,500
What are they doing here?

311
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,900
- Well, I called them.
- What?

312
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,600
Well there’s got to be someone 

313
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,100
- Probably.
- Yeah.

314
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,900
So ma’am, you didn’t
personally see the man yourself?

315
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:28,900
No.

316
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,700
But I don’t think she’s making it up.

317
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,100
Not anymore.

318
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,800
Well, look there has to be 
some sort of explanation.

319
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,100
Sir, that’s why we're here, okay?

320
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,700
Bring me a chair from the kitchen.

321
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,000
It’s coming from inside the wall.

322
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:27,900
Them what? Mice maybe?

323
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,700
Big bloody mouse.

324
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,100
Well, there’s uh...

325
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,500
Nothing we can do about that.

326

352

How did you find out about that?

353
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,200
The police constables filed an incident report.

354
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:09,300
It’s had raised a few eyebrows.

355
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:16,200
I’d rather not have my business spread
all over the tele, if you don't mind!

- Is it still happening?

Because if it is, getting your side of the story,

358
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:22,400
I might be your best chance of finding help.

00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,800
The family reached out 
to the Church for help?

489
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:38,500
Yes, but...

490
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:41,600
Truthfully, we have been 
reluctant to get involved.

491
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:44,300
The case has turned into a 
media circus over there.

492
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:46,200
And they are calling it
England’s Amityville.

493
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:47,400
Great.

494
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:48,800
Are you afraid it’s a hoax?

495
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:53,300
The Church’s ability to help people
depends on it’s reputation.

496
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:56,100
So what do you 
want us to do?

497
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:57,900
We’d like you to fly to London.

498
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,100
For three days to act as a..

499
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,600
our unofficial eyes and ears.

500
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,500
Now you don’t have to do anything.

501
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:07,500
If it is a hoax, you just 
turn around and leave.

502
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:09,200
But if it is not..

503
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:12,500
then there is a 
family in London

504
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:14,600
that desperately needs our help.

505
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:20,000
Well thank you for 
your faith in us.

506
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,500
- Just let me know.
- Okay.

507
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:28,300
I told him we’ll talk about it.

508
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:31,600
There's nothing to talk about.

509
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:32,600
Honey, you heard him.

510
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:35,900
They do not want us to get involved, 

511
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:39,900
There have always been 
cases we’ve turned down,

512
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:42,400
There have never been a
family that we refused to help.

513
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:46,400
I had a vision in Amityville.

514
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:50,900
It was the same one 
I had 7 years ago.

515
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:57,600
I had a premonition 
of your death.

516
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:03,900
Wait, that's why you locked
yourself away for eight days?

517
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:05,000
You saw my death?

518
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:06,500
You’ve seen it too.

519
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:09,700
The demon in your painting is real.

520
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:12,400
We have both seen the same
inhuman spirit.

521
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:15,100
It’s a warning,
if we keep doing this...

522
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:17,600
You’re going to die.

523
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Your visions are a gift from God.

524
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:25,600
And if God is showing you my
death, he’s doing it for a reason.

525
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,200
Maybe you were meant to 
prevent it from happening.

526
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:34,000
Come on. We don’t 
run from fights.

527
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:46,500
If we go, if we do this,

528
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:49,900
you have to promise me that 
we are just there to observe.

529
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,500
If everything turns out 

530
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:56,300
we’re gonna tell the 
Church and we’re gonna get out.

531
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:58,200
Promise me.

532
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:01,700
Promise me, Ed.

533
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:05,600
I promise.

534
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:15,900
Mr and Mrs Warren,

535
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,400
I am Maurice Grosse, 
thank you so much for coming.

536
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:21,900
I believe you’re gonna be
staying in the Hodgson house,

537
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:23,000
is that right?

538
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:24,600
Always better to be on the mix.

539
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:25,900
Oh, yeah I agree.

540
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:34,300
This is it.

541
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:40,800
Here we are.

542
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,700
Ed, we managed to capture 
some amazing things.

543
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:49,800
I think you’ll be very impressed
with what you see.

544
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:52,600
Great, yeah I'd like to listen 
to those tapes again too.

545
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:54,400
There’s really interesting stuff in it.

546
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:59,300
Vic Nottingham. Hi Vic.

547
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:01,700
- How are you? Ed Warren.
- Hello mate.

548
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:03,600
How are you?

549
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:05,100
And this is Peggy, Peggy Hodgson.

550
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:06,600
- Nice to meet you, Ed Warren.
- How do you do?

551
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:08,300
- My wife Lorraine.
- How do you do?

552
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:09,400
- Hello.
- Hello.

553
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:11,100
Well, I’ll be off here Pegg.

554
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:12,700
Will you tell the kids I said hello.

555
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:13,500
Yeah of course I will.

556
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:14,700
- Nice to meet you.
- You too, Hon.

557
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,600
So here we are, Peggy.

558
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:17,600
Well do come in.

559
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,900
It’s just me and Janet here now.

560
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,900
My other kids are staying with them.

561
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,200
This is where the girls used slept, but...

562
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:26,400
- We don’t use it anymore.
- Why not?

563
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,700
Well most of the activity 
centred in this room,

564
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:31,000
we were quite afraid that someone might get hurt,

565
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:32,300
that’s why we kept it locked.

566
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,800
I understand that Janet
has levitated?

567
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:36,100
Does that happened in here as well?

568
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:37,300
- Yeah..

569
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,000
We’ve got photographs of that as well.

570
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,600
I would like to hear Mrs. Hodgson’s 

571
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,300
The neighbors donated them all.

572
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:54,900
I hung them up hoping to keep 
things from moving around.

573
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:01,200
- Does it work?
- No.

574
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,700
We can hear it all night.

575
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,000
Hi there, I'm Lorraine.

576
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,100
Mind if I have a sit?

577
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:42,800
Do you know why I’m here?

578
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:47,400
Well, your mom’s told me about 
what’s been going on..

579
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,600
and I'm here 
to help if I can.

580
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:51,000
Would you like to talk about it?

581
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:57,800
You know when I was about your age,

582
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,100
I was visiting my mom in a hospital,

583
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:02,500
and.. I saw an angel.

584
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Yeah.

585
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:08,500
It was..

586
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:11,000
standing next to a little waste bed,

587
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:13,200
and just gently touching his cheek,

588
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:14,600
and it stopped then 

589
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:17,100
it looked right at me.

590
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:19,700
Of course my mom and the
nurses did not believe me...

591
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:21,900
but I knew it was real.

592
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:28,500
Look, I know how it is.

593
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:32,500
I know what it’s like to lose your 
friends, because you're different.

594
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:36,300
But I also know that..

595
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:39,400
One person can change everything.

596
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:41,800
And you just have to open up to them.

597
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,300
How did you know you could trust
the people you have been talked to?

598
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:57,400
I didn’t. 
Sometimes I got hurt.

599
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:01,900
And it took a long time, but..

600
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:05,800
I finally found someone who believed me.

601
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:10,900
What did you do then?

602
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:14,900
I married him.

603
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:29,100
I'm just so tired.

604
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:34,200
I can’t sleep here.

605
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:38,900
I used to go to the medical at school.

606
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:41,300
And they let me sleep there.

607
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:44,100
Because I was so worn out.

608
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,200
But now I can’t even do that.

609
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:55,500
Everyone’s afraid of me.

610
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:01,000
I got no friends.

611
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:04,200
No place I can go to.

612
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:10,900
It makes me feel like I'm not normal.

613
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:14,900
You know, whatever’s 
doing this to you..

614
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:16,300
wants you to feel this way.

615
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,400
But why?

616
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:22,000
Because.. that’s what makes it stronger.

617
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:25,100
Around the time 
this all started..

618
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:28,300
Janet started waking up
here, in the middle of the night.

619
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,200
This is the spot Janet said

620
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:32,200
Bill Wilkins died, 
right here.

621
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:34,900
Where’d you get it from?

622
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:40,700
My ex-husband bought all the furniture
with the house when we moved in.

623
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,100
If you don’t mind me asking,

624
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:45,000
is your ex-husband still in the picture?

625
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
No.

626
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,500
Sorry to hear that.

627
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:52,600
Is there any chance of
reconciliation?

628
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:55,200
He had twins with a woman
from around the corner.

629
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:59,000
I’m gonna take that as a "no".

630
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:03,100
Yes, it’s been a lot to do with.

631
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,400
He took all the music 
the day he left.

632
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:08,700
I know most feel like that sometimes..

633
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:10,900
No, I mean he literally took
away all the records.

634
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:13,400
My kids used to love listening to
his Elvis collection.

635
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:16,200
They've been through so much.

636
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,100
And now all these is happening on top.

637
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:20,800
Yeah, the timing 
isn’t a coincidence.

638
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:23,400
Negative event like this
often feed off on emotional distress.

639
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,200
They like to kick you when you're down.

640
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,000
Well that hardly seemed fair.

641
01:08:28,900 --> 01:08:30,300
No, it really isn’t.

642
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,200
Do you know when the voice 
is going to speak?

643
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:37,000
Sometimes.

644
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:40,600
And when it does, does it feel like
it’s coming from inside you?

645
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:45,800
No.

646
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:49,200
Well it's coming from behind me.

647
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:52,200
Like I’m being used.

648
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:56,900
Does it ever say things,
just to you?

649
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:58,700
That only you can hear?

650
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:05,600
What is it saying?

651
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:11,300
It says it wants to hurt you.

652
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,000
When did it say that?

653
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:22,700
Right now.

654
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:34,900
Do we really need that?

655
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:39,100
We would like to be able to prove to the 
Church that 
she is not making the voice herself.

656
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:41,400
So by holding the water in her mouth,
we would be able to show

657
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:43,700
that it is not some form of ventriloquism.

658
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:47,000
Does she have to be in the chair?
Just..

659
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:49,400
make me sick seeing her sitting there like that.

660
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:52,600
You know it's hard, but the spirit
has shown an attachment to the spot.

661
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:55,400
It will be easier for Ed to contact her,
if she is sitting there.

662
01:09:58,600 --> 01:09:59,700
You'll be alright.

663
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,100
Are you ready for this?

664
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:08,000
I guess so.

665
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,100
It’s December 21st, 1977.

666
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:15,400
This is Ed and Lorraine Warren,

667
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:17,300
sitting with Peggy and Janet Hodgson,

668
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:19,500
also present, is Maurice Grosse.

669
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:21,900
Alright, let’s get started.

670
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:36,800
If there is something here that 
would like to communicate with us,

671
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:39,500
we are all ears. Speak up.

672
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:50,200
What do you want with this
girl and her family?

673
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,300
It says it won’t talk, if you all
are looking at me like this.

674
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:09,200
Strange! I wonder why not?

675
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:11,500
It hasn’t been shy of talking up until now.

676
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:14,800
How about if we all turn our backs?

677
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,500
Think it’ll speak if we all do that?

678
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:18,700
Maybe.

679
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:20,600
Well.

680
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:24,000
Let's try this again.

681
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,400
So what do you think Bill?

682
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,600
We’ve given you your privacy.

683
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:48,200
Now come on out and talk to us.

684
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:11,000
<i> Here I come.. </i>

685
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:15,400
Am I talking to the spirit that 
is 
oppressing this family?

686
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:22,200
<i> Is that what I am? </i>

687
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:25,200
<i> Is that what I’m doing? </i>

688
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,100
Yes.

689
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:29,500
And I’ve come to put a stop to it.

690
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:32,000
Do you know who I am?

691
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,000
<i> Ed.. </i>

692
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:38,500
<i> Eddie.. </i>

693
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:41,300
<i> Edward. </i>

694
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:44,700
Ed, is fine.

695
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,600
<i> Your father called you "Edward". </i>

696
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:53,300
Not true.

697
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:55,900
My father called me Ed, 
just like everybody else.

698
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:03,700
Come on Bill, you're 
not psychiatrist..

699
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:05,400
and I’m not here to talk
about my father.

700
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:07,100
Let’s get down to business,
what do you say?

701
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:12,800
Why don’t you just leave 
these people alone?

702
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:19,200
<i> Because this is my house. </i>

703
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,100
It’s not your house.

704
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:26,500
<i> Yes, it is. </i>

705
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:29,700
<i> I’ve come here to see my family </i>

706
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:32,400
<i> but they’re not here now. </i>

707
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:34,400
That’s because you're dead.

708
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:37,600
If your family did lived here,
they’re long gone now.

709
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,500
<i> Ed.. </i>

710
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:44,600
<i> Where are they? </i>

711
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:49,100
I don’t know. If I did 
maybe I can help you.

712
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,600
<i> I don’t need your help. </i>

713
01:13:53,700 --> 01:13:55,600
Then why don’t you just move on?

714
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:01,900
<i> I don’t believe in that. </i>

715
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:04,700
Why not?

716
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:08,300
What would be so wrong 
with going to Heaven?

717
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:18,800
<i> I.. I'm not a heaven man. </i>

718
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:23,500
Well I’ve got news for you Bill..

719
01:14:24,900 --> 01:14:26,900
See, I don’t care what you believed in.

720
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:29,600
You see this?

721
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:42,400
<i> Help! Me.. let.. go.. </i>

722
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:47,600
<i> Help! It.. let.. go.. </i>

723
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:23,300
<i> Are you sensing a presence? </i>

724
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:26,300
No, just the opposite, 
I’m not sensing anything.

725
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:28,600
We could be looking at..

726
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:30,700
hysterical neurosis.

727
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:33,900
That would explain the
multiple personalities and..

728
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,300
hallucinations.

729
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:37,900
That doesn’t feel right either.

730
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:43,100
I can’t explain it, in my heart, 
it’s telling me to believe them.

731
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:45,500
I heard that voice, 
with my own ears.

732
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:48,700
But all I can sense
is their own fear.

733
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:50,800
I can’t seem to see beyond that.

734
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:11,100
I don’t think I can sleep
this far away from you.

735
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,100
Well you’re gonna.

736
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:16,400
I’ll give you something to look 
forward to when we get home.

737
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:32,600
Oh love, I wish you 
wouldn’t do that!

738
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:34,600
It helps me sleep.

739
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:36,900
At least I know I'm not going anywhere.

740
01:16:55,900 --> 01:16:57,900
I didn’t smoke, mom.

741
01:16:58,200 --> 01:16:59,200
Hey?

742
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:05,000
That day with Camilla at school.

743
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:07,300
I was holding the cigarette,

744
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:09,600
but I wasn’t going to 
take a puff, I swear.

745
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:13,900
I just wanted to look 
cool in front of her.

746
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:16,100
It’s stupid.

747
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:18,800
Oh, love!

748
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:22,500
I’m sorry I didn’t believed you.

749
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:26,500
Oh God!

750
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:16,100
Help!

751
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:19,700
Help!

752
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:30,900
Janet? Oh my God!

753
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,100
Janet?

754
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:34,300
Janet?

755
01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:35,600
- Help!
- Janet!

756
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:37,200
Janet!

757
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:45,000
- Mom!
- Janet!

758
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:48,000
Help, get me out.
There is somebody in here.

759
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:49,500
I can’t open it!

760
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,800
Mom, help me!

761
01:20:57,800 --> 01:20:59,100
Janet!

762
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:02,000
- Mom! Mom! 
- Janet!

763
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,200
- What’s going on?
- There is someone in there with Janet.

764
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:07,500
I can’t get it open!

765
01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:09,300
Get the key!
 Go! 

766
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:15,600
Janet, hold on! 
We’re coming!

767
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:17,200
<i> Help me! </i>

768
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:19,800
- I got the key!
- I got the key!

769
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:22,800
Come on!

770
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:27,800
Janet, we’re coming.

771
01:21:29,700 --> 01:21:30,300
It’s ok.

772
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:31,300
Janet!

773
01:21:31,300 --> 01:21:33,500
Take it off me. 
Please take it off!

774
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:37,500
My God!

775
01:21:38,300 --> 01:21:39,600
It was someone in here!

776
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:42,000
I saw it with me own eyes.

777
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:43,600
He did this to my girl.

778
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:01,900
This is the bite where
Janet received the first night.

779
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,900
It has faded a bit here, 

780
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:09,100
Yeah, it's pretty distinctive,
two missing teeth.

781
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:11,300
That's right. It's too big
for one of the children.

782
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:13,100
You think this 
was the spirit?

783
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:14,500
This Bill Wilkins?

784
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:16,000
I tracked down the home owner,

785
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,100
and it turns out the 
owner’s 
father lived there.

786
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:19,800
His name was William Wilkins.

787
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:22,500
And he died of a haemorrhage 
in 
the brain in that chair.

788
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,900
Everything she said is true.

789
01:22:25,900 --> 01:22:27,400
All public information, by the way.

790
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:29,700
She could have heard the 
whole story 
from a neighbor.

791
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:34,000
And what about the claim that Janet has 
been 
teleporting around the house in her sleep?

792
01:22:34,300 --> 01:22:37,600
About as valid as the claims of
her levitating off her bed.

793
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:39,700
Were any of you there 
when it happened?

794
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,900
No, but I have
pictures of that too.

795
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:43,400
Yeah, there you go.

796
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
I set my camera up 
in the girls' room

797
01:22:46,100 --> 01:22:48,000
and then I went downstairs 
with the remote control

798
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
and fire it off whenever 
I heard any commotion.

799
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:54,600
I have to admit,
well her knees are bend..

800
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:58,100
the upright position of her body,
looks like she is just jumping.

801
01:22:58,100 --> 01:23:01,300
What are you saying? You were there last 
night, you saw with your own eyes.

802
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:02,700
Well..

803
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:05,100
Peggy was the one who saw
someone attacking Janet.

804
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:09,000
But she teleported herself into a 
room
 locked from the outside

805
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:09,900
for goodness sake!

806
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,300
And what about her voice?

807
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:13,300
How the heck do you explain that?

808
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:14,600
I think..

809
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:16,200
the first time she 
was making that voice..

810
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:18,200
was in front of
television cameras.

811
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:20,200
And she couldn’t do it 
with water in her mouth,

812
01:23:20,300 --> 01:23:21,700
until you looked away.

813
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:23,400
So, she could have spit it out,

814
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:25,500
take another sip 
before you turn back.

815
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:28,000
Last year I was conned by Welsh family

816
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:29,600
pretending to be possessed by demons.

817
01:23:29,900 --> 01:23:32,900
Honestly, I don’t know what 
was worse, the demons,

818
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:36,300
or the people who preyed on our 
willingness to believe in them.

819
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:37,900
The Demons..

820
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:40,000
are worse.

821
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:44,600
But you must admit it is suspicious.

822
01:23:44,700 --> 01:23:47,900
You sincerely believed that 

823
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:49,200
And what about Peggy?

824
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:51,600
Oh, she is just using the whole thing as an excuse

825
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:53,300
to get better housing from the council.

826
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:55,000
She already applied!

827
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,900
Look, I’m not saying it’s a hoax.

828
01:23:57,100 --> 01:23:59,800
Sometimes what we do,
requires a leap of faith.

829
01:24:00,100 --> 01:24:02,100
To believe when 
nobody else will.

830
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:04,200
So, you really do believe them?

831
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:08,300
Yes, we do.

832
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:10,600
But the Church can’t do 
anything without proof.

833
01:24:10,900 --> 01:24:11,800
That’s what we need.

834
01:24:11,900 --> 01:24:14,700
Right. I'll make some telephone 
calls, see if I can

835
01:24:14,700 --> 01:24:16,600
get hold of some video 
recording equipment.

836
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:19,600
In the meantime, Ed and I can be
spending time with Peggy and the kids.

837
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:21,600
Cause they need to be a family again.

838
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:24,300
Hi Mom, we’re back!

839
01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:25,300
Oh, you did what?

840
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:26,800
What’s all this?

841
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,100
- Mr. and Mrs. Warren bought us some wine.

842
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:31,100
Oh, Blue Hawaii.

843
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:33,600
Hope you don’t mind, 
a little American culture.

844
01:24:33,700 --> 01:24:34,700
Not at all.

845
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:38,100
Billy! I missed you!

846
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:41,900
Hi guys. I missed you.

847
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:46,200
So have any of you ever been 

848
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:51,200
Pete, at school. He is 
always picking on Billy.

849
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:54,200
And dear tell me, what do 
you do 
when that happens?

850
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:57,100
T—t-t-they stick up for me.

851
01:24:57,100 --> 01:25:00,200
Good, because the spirit in this
house is a lot like that bully.

852
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:00,900
Yes.

853
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:02,300
And he’s got it in for Janet.

854
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:04,200
So you guys got to stick up for her,

855
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:05,800
the same way they stick up for you.

856
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:07,300
Family sticks together.

857
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:09,700
This on the other hand,
is a lost cause.

858
01:25:09,700 --> 01:25:11,100
Oh, bloody hell!

859
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:13,000
Now all sorts of things stopped working,

860
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,500
for no reason at all.

861
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:17,200
Well, we’re gonna have music 
in here, one way or another.

862
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:20,200
Whose guitar is that?

863
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,400
It was Dad’s, but he 
said I could have it.

864
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:24,700
Yeah, do you mind?

865
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:25,800
No.

866
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:28,700


867
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,600
A little rusty, so

868
01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:33,000
got to promise not to laugh.

869
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:37,700
Especially you.

870
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:49,700

01:25:50,300 --> 01:25:55,200

873
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,200
Hey, don’t laugh now.

887
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:33,000
Thank you very much!

888
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:41,400
Oh my God!

889
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:45,700
It's so small and light!

890
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:49,700
Why do you do this?

891
01:27:50,100 --> 01:27:51,900
Help people like us?

892
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:53,500
When you were little,

893
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:56,600
were you ever worried that there might be
something hiding under your bed at night?

894
01:27:56,900 --> 01:27:57,900


895
01:27:58,400 --> 01:27:59,400
Well..

896
01:28:01,100 --> 01:28:04,200
In my bed, actually had
something under.

897
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Yeah..

898
01:28:06,300 --> 01:28:08,800
Something grabbed my hand and 

899
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:11,200
It was too dark to 
see under there,

900
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:13,600
but let me tell you I r
an out of there so fast..

901
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:14,800
You know what my dad did?

902
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
He dragged me right back into the room,

903
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,800
and told me I had to face my fears.

904
01:28:19,700 --> 01:28:21,600
And I was scared to death,

905
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:26,200
but then I remembered what this 
nun had told me in catechism.

906
01:28:27,100 --> 01:28:30,000
God will be there for all who need it.

907
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:32,500
So..

908
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,300
I grab this crucifix out, 
from my nightstand, right..

909
01:28:37,100 --> 01:28:38,600
And I tell whatever’s under there..

910
01:28:39,300 --> 01:28:40,700
that it better leave

911
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,500
or God was gonna kick its butt.

912
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:48,700
Best thing my father ever did for me.

913
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:52,200
Of course he only did it because
he really didn’t believed me.

914
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:54,900
It took me years to finally 
find someone who did.

915
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:56,600
And you know I did then?

916
01:28:56,900 --> 01:28:58,200
You married her?

917
01:29:02,900 --> 01:29:04,900
So you’ve heard this story before?

918
01:29:07,900 --> 01:29:09,200


919
01:29:12,100 --> 01:29:13,600
How are you getting on in here?

920
01:29:13,700 --> 01:29:14,700
Good!

921
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:16,300
We’re done here.

922
01:29:16,300 --> 01:29:17,800
fixed the closet door too.

923
01:29:17,900 --> 01:29:20,500
And if you’d like, I can take
a look at the washing machine.

924
01:29:21,100 --> 01:29:22,800
Oh no, I couldn’t ask 
you to do that.

925
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:24,500
- It's a disaster down there.
- Come on.

926
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:25,900
How bad can it be?

927
01:29:29,100 --> 01:29:30,500
Bloody hell!

928
01:29:31,300 --> 01:29:33,200
Everything’s still quiet in there?

929
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:35,300
Yes, thank goodness, yes.

930
01:29:36,100 --> 01:29:37,900
It would be something now, wouldn’t it?

931
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:41,200
If we were able to prove 
beyond a shadow of a doubt

932
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:42,900
that there is a life

933
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,400
beyond this.

934
01:29:46,100 --> 01:29:48,500
It would be historic.

935
01:29:49,100 --> 01:29:50,600
Is that why you’re doing this?

936
01:29:50,700 --> 01:29:52,600
Because you want to be a 
part of something "historic"?

937
01:29:53,300 --> 01:29:54,800
This isn’t a laboratory.

938
01:29:54,900 --> 01:29:56,600
This is someone's home.

939
01:29:56,700 --> 01:29:59,700
And I think helping that family 

940
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,900
No, I’m sorry. 
I didn’t mean that.

941
01:30:03,700 --> 01:30:05,800
My daughter died in a car crash

942
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:07,400
several years ago.

943
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:10,100
Afterwards, I started to..

944
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:11,500
experience things..

945
01:30:11,500 --> 01:30:14,100
I think she wanted
to communicate with me.

946
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:17,800
And yes it would help if I knew 
that she was..

947
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:19,800
I do not know.

948
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:23,900
Somewhere.

949
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,100
That’s not it.

950
01:30:45,100 --> 01:30:46,200
Oh, great!

951
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,300
I think I found it.

952
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:22,700
It’s right here.

953
01:31:25,300 --> 01:31:27,000
<i> (Thumping) </i>

954
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:43,300
Uh..

955
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:51,300
God.

956
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:55,600
Alright.

957
01:31:57,800 --> 01:31:59,700
Yeah.

958
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:21,700
What’s that?

959
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:45,400
Ed?

960
01:32:45,700 --> 01:32:47,400
There's something behind you.

961
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:14,800
Come here!

962
01:33:14,900 --> 01:33:15,900
It grabbed me.

963
01:33:16,100 --> 01:33:18,800
It was in me. It tried 
to pull me under.

964
01:33:21,500 --> 01:33:22,600
Oh my god, look!

965
01:33:23,700 --> 01:33:25,500
- Oh God, you’re scratched.
- It’s not a scratch.

966
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:28,800
It's a bite mark, it bit me 
just 
like it did with Janet.

967
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:29,200
- Hey Janet, can you get me another one?
- Yeah.

968
01:34:48,200 --> 01:34:49,400
Janet?

969
01:34:50,100 --> 01:34:51,100
What’s wrong?

970
01:34:53,100 --> 01:34:54,700
Don’t you see it?

971
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,300
See what?

972
01:35:00,700 --> 01:35:02,000
In the kitchen.

973
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:06,500
Tell me what you see.

974
01:35:08,900 --> 01:35:11,300
It’s playing with the knives.

975
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:14,600
Hiding in the dark.

976
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:26,400
Johnny?

977
01:35:26,500 --> 01:35:27,600
Johnny, what are you doing?

978
01:35:32,100 --> 01:35:33,200
Johnny, no!

979
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:34,900
Johnny don’t go!

980
01:35:35,500 --> 01:35:37,300
Remember what Mr. Warren said.

981
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:39,200
We can’t let it bully us.

982
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:41,600
This is our house.

983
01:35:43,100 --> 01:35:44,100
Johnny!

984
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:46,000
Johnny, please come back!

985
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:05,000
What’s the matter? 
What happened?

986
01:36:05,200 --> 01:36:07,900
Janet’s gone!
She was just right here!

987
01:36:11,500 --> 01:36:13,000
- Come on!
- Oh no!

988
01:36:19,100 --> 01:36:20,300
No.

989
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,300
- Mom!
- Johnny!

990
01:36:26,500 --> 01:36:27,900
Ed, what’s going on?

991
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:32,200
Johnny’s in there!

992
01:36:32,200 --> 01:36:34,600
- No!
- Mom!

993
01:36:34,700 --> 01:36:36,100
Johnny!

994
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,400
- Johnny!
- Okay. Please step back!

995
01:36:51,300 --> 01:36:52,400
Where are they?

996
01:36:52,900 --> 01:36:53,900
Where are they?

997
01:36:54,900 --> 01:36:55,900
Johnny?

998
01:36:56,300 --> 01:36:57,300
Johnny?

999
01:37:01,100 --> 01:37:02,200
Johnny!

1000
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:05,400
- Oh, darling, come here.
- Mom!

1001
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,500
Are you all right?

1002
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:10,700
It’s alright, darling.

1003
01:37:17,100 --> 01:37:18,100
Where is Janet?

1004
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:22,900
Where is Janet?

1005
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:25,400
Janet!

1006
01:37:44,300 --> 01:37:46,400
Guys, I'm picking up something in here.

1007
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:54,400
Oh Ed, watch it.

1008
01:38:09,100 --> 01:38:11,900
<i> It.. want.. me.. </i>

1009
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:15,600
<i> want me.. </i>

1010
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:28,700
- Janet!
- It’s okay, it’s okay. Come on.

1011
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:30,200
Come on.

1012
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:32,000
Come on out.

1013
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:34,700
I got you..

1014
01:38:34,700 --> 01:38:35,700
Janet.

1015
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:37,200
Yeah..

1016
01:38:38,300 --> 01:38:40,000
It's over.

1017
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,300


1018
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:45,000
How did she get in there?

1019
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:55,100
It’s alright, darling.

1020
01:38:55,800 --> 01:38:57,300
What’s that?

1021
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:08,700
Can I..?

1022
01:39:13,100 --> 01:39:14,100
What is it?

1023
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:16,300
She's faking it.

1024
01:39:17,300 --> 01:39:18,300
What?

1025
01:39:18,700 --> 01:39:19,900
I have proof.

1026
01:40:03,900 --> 01:40:05,800
So much for your leap of faith.

1027
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:12,700
What?

1028
01:40:12,900 --> 01:40:15,700
My girl didn’t make this up.
I’ve seen things.

1029
01:40:15,900 --> 01:40:18,000
She was caught red 
handed faking an event.

1030
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:19,300
No, it's not possible.

1031
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:20,600
Have you seen it in there?

1032
01:40:20,700 --> 01:40:23,300
How can a 12 year old girl
throw a table across the room? It’s…

1033
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:24,900
It's over! Do you understand?

1034
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:28,700
For the sake of your daughter, don’t
make this harder than it already is.

1035
01:40:30,500 --> 01:40:32,100
She couldn’t have pull this off alone.

1036
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:34,800
Oh how dare you!

1037
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:37,000
What you think I put her up to this?

1038
01:40:37,300 --> 01:40:38,100
What about the police?

1039
01:40:38,100 --> 01:40:39,700
Are they on this too?

1040
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:40,700
It’s alright.

1041
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:42,000
What about you two?

1042
01:40:44,700 --> 01:40:46,300
You believed us, don’t you?

1043
01:40:50,300 --> 01:40:51,600
We want to help.

1044
01:40:51,900 --> 01:40:54,000
But the Church take one look at that video,

1045
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:55,400
and that will be the end of it.

1046
01:40:56,300 --> 01:40:58,400
They’ll want to distance 
themselves from anything that..

1047
01:40:58,500 --> 01:41:00,400
remotely resembles a hoax.

1048
01:41:04,700 --> 01:41:06,200
I want you to leave, please.

1049
01:41:08,100 --> 01:41:09,400
Now go and get out!

1050
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:11,900
Get out the lot of ya!

1051
01:41:13,100 --> 01:41:14,400
Get out!

1052
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:29,900
Perhaps you could somehow 
reach out to the spirit

1053
01:41:30,100 --> 01:41:32,500
make contact with it yourself.

1054
01:41:32,500 --> 01:41:33,300
I can’t.

1055
01:41:33,400 --> 01:41:34,700
Believe me I tried.

1056
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
I’m sorry. I’m just not 
sensing anything here.

1057
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:38,900
So that’s it then?

1058
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,400
You hold out a lifeline to them and
then you just throw it away.

1059
01:41:41,400 --> 01:41:43,600
We don’t like this anymore than you do.

1060
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:45,800
We’ll tell the Church about everything we’ve seen,

1061
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:48,700
but the only piece of concrete evidence we got

1062
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:50,500
is a video of Janet 
faking an incident.

1063
01:41:50,500 --> 01:41:54,000
Hasn’t it been literally 
dozens 
of genuine incidents?

1064
01:41:54,300 --> 01:41:55,200
You might want this.

1065
01:41:57,700 --> 01:41:59,900
- doesn’t change the fact...
- No, it changes everything.

1066
01:42:00,900 --> 01:42:03,000
We are agents of the Church here.

1067
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:06,000
They’d be calling us home even if

1068
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:10,600
You’ve done really good work here Maurice.

1069
01:42:10,900 --> 01:42:13,200
You were here for them when no one else was.

1070
01:42:19,100 --> 01:42:20,300
Thank you.

1071
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:25,700
But sometimes you need 
to make a leap of faith.

1072
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:29,200
Believe, when nobody else will.

1073
01:43:06,700 --> 01:43:08,000
This doesn’t feel right.

1074
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:11,100
I know.

1075
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:54,200
Did you really do it?

1076
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,600
But why?

1077
01:44:02,900 --> 01:44:05,500
It said it would kill you.

1078
01:44:06,900 --> 01:44:09,200
If I didn’t make them leave.

1079
01:44:11,400 --> 01:44:13,000
Don’t you think it’s a little convenient

1080
01:44:13,100 --> 01:44:16,100
that she just happens to fake an 
incident in the one room in the house,

1081
01:44:16,300 --> 01:44:18,300
that had a video camera pointing at it?

1082
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:19,500
Yeah.

1083
01:44:23,700 --> 01:44:25,000
Damn it!

1084
01:44:39,500 --> 01:44:40,500
Lorraine?

1085
01:44:41,500 --> 01:44:43,200
Help me set up these tape recorders.

1086
01:44:56,100 --> 01:44:57,900
Thread it through and start it from the top.

1087
01:45:03,500 --> 01:45:04,500
Alright.

1088
01:45:04,900 --> 01:45:07,700
Remember those strange garbled 
messages 
we got from Janet?

1089
01:45:07,700 --> 01:45:09,600
You know from.. Bill.

1090
01:45:09,900 --> 01:45:11,700
- Yes
- There were two of them, right?

1091
01:45:12,100 --> 01:45:13,400
This is the first one.

1092
01:45:15,100 --> 01:45:21,200
<i> Help! It.. let.. go.. </i>

1093
01:45:21,300 --> 01:45:27,300
<i> Help! It.. let.. go.. </i>

1094
01:45:29,100 --> 01:45:31,500
- We thought it was referring to
himself, right? 
- Yes.

1095
01:45:31,700 --> 01:45:33,100
Listen to the second one.

1096
01:45:35,100 --> 01:45:42,200
<i> It.. won't..
me... won't.. me.. </i>

1097
01:45:53,700 --> 01:45:55,200
If I’m right about this...

1098
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:09,000
<i> Help me! It won’t let me go! </i>

1099
01:46:49,700 --> 01:46:50,900
I come here..

1100
01:46:51,400 --> 01:46:53,000
to see my family.

1101
01:46:53,400 --> 01:46:55,800
But they're not here now.

1102
01:46:58,500 --> 01:46:59,600
I think..

1103
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:03,200
I’d like to go now.

1104
01:47:04,700 --> 01:47:06,900
- But I can’t.
- Why not?

1105
01:47:07,800 --> 01:47:09,500
It wants her..

1106
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:11,100
so badly.

1107
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:13,400
It almost has her.

1108
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:15,800
Tell me how to stop it.

1109
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:21,200
I'm giving..

1110
01:47:21,900 --> 01:47:23,600
and I’m taking.

1111
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:26,200
I was there at your first breath.

1112
01:47:26,500 --> 01:47:28,800
It didn’t asked for me.

1113
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,300
But I'll follow you

1114
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:33,500
till death!

1115
01:47:33,700 --> 01:47:36,100
Wait, I don’t understand..

1116
01:47:36,100 --> 01:47:38,100
Please..

1117
01:47:42,100 --> 01:47:43,500
Oh God. Honey, you're bleeding!

1118
01:47:45,200 --> 01:47:46,600
What is happening?

1119
01:47:51,900 --> 01:47:53,900
The old man’s spirit

1120
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:55,700
is just a pawn.

1121
01:47:55,900 --> 01:47:57,500
He’s been enslaved

1122
01:47:57,500 --> 01:47:59,300
to weaken Janet’s will.

1123
01:47:59,400 --> 01:48:00,500
Enslaved? Enslaved by who?

1124
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:05,400
Something inhuman. Something that’s taking
a blasphemous form to attack my faith.

1125
01:48:05,700 --> 01:48:07,500
There is a demonic presence in that house.

1126
01:48:08,900 --> 01:48:11,700
You need to get Vic before he 
leaves.
We need to go back!

1127
01:48:11,700 --> 01:48:12,800
Okay.

1128
01:48:33,500 --> 01:48:35,300
Mom, help me, please!

1129
01:48:35,300 --> 01:48:36,400
Mom, please!

1130
01:48:36,500 --> 01:48:37,500
Mom, help me!

1131
01:48:37,800 --> 01:48:38,900
Help!

1132
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:43,500
For God’s sake,
leave us alone!

1133
01:48:46,500 --> 01:48:47,800
Margaret?

1134
01:48:50,100 --> 01:48:51,200
Margaret?

1135
01:48:51,800 --> 01:48:53,600
Margaret, no!

1136
01:48:53,800 --> 01:48:55,500
Margaret, come on honey.

1137
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:57,000
- Come on.
- Mom?

1138
01:48:57,300 --> 01:48:58,900
What is happening?

1139
01:48:59,800 --> 01:49:01,300
Come on let’s get out.

1140
01:49:04,600 --> 01:49:06,000
Go to Peggy’s house!

1141
01:49:06,100 --> 01:49:08,200
- Are you not coming?
- I can't leave Janet.

1142
01:49:09,800 --> 01:49:11,200
No, Janet!

1143
01:49:11,300 --> 01:49:12,500
Mom!

1144
01:49:13,300 --> 01:49:14,300
Janet!

1145
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:17,200
I don’t understand it, I mean first
you said it's not real..

1146
01:49:17,300 --> 01:49:17,900
Now it is.

1147
01:49:17,900 --> 01:49:20,300
Our sight are being blocked by the inhuman spirit.

1148
01:49:20,300 --> 01:49:21,800
The old man’s spirit,

1149
01:49:21,800 --> 01:49:24,200
couldn’t break though until
we left that house.

1150
01:49:24,300 --> 01:49:27,400
Everything they have experienced has been
a manifestation of that demonic.

1151
01:49:27,400 --> 01:49:29,600
The old, the crooked man,
are just facade,

1152
01:49:29,600 --> 01:49:31,400
trying to keep us from seeing
the real evil in that house.

1153
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:33,600
In my vision, he wanted to help 
me 
but he was too afraid.

1154
01:49:33,700 --> 01:49:36,100
And he kept speaking in a
kind of riddle.

1155
01:49:40,300 --> 01:49:41,700
Something like..

1156
01:49:41,900 --> 01:49:43,400
I am given and I am taken,

1157
01:49:43,800 --> 01:49:45,300
I was there, at your first breath.

1158
01:49:45,700 --> 01:49:47,300
You didn’t asked for me.

1159
01:49:48,500 --> 01:49:51,000
But I will follow you
until your death.

1160
01:49:56,200 --> 01:49:56,800
Your name..

1161
01:49:56,900 --> 01:49:59,000
you didn’t asked for it, it was given
when you were born.

1162
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:00,400
That’s it! Knowing the demon’s name.. 

1163
01:50:00,500 --> 01:50:02,000
gives us power over it, and we can cast it out.

1164
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,800
Yeah. Sure, but don’t
 know it’s name.

1165
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:06,200
Or maybe we do.

1166
01:50:07,500 --> 01:50:09,200
Why else would he gave us that clue?

1167
01:50:09,400 --> 01:50:11,200
He must think that we knew it somehow.

1168
01:50:11,600 --> 01:50:13,200
So what do you do now?

1169
01:50:13,300 --> 01:50:15,600
An inhuman spirit powerful enough
to cloud Lorraine’s sight..

1170
01:50:15,600 --> 01:50:16,700
is more than a match for me.

1171
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:19,200
We need to bring Janet to the

1172
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:24,400
Janet!

1173
01:50:24,500 --> 01:50:25,700
Margaret?

1174
01:50:34,600 --> 01:50:35,600
Janet!

1175
01:50:37,200 --> 01:50:39,100
Oh thank God you’re here,
Janet is in there.

1176
01:51:07,800 --> 01:51:09,300
- Ed, are you okay?
- Yes.

1177
01:51:11,400 --> 01:51:12,400
I'm gonna go around the back.

1178
01:51:12,500 --> 01:51:14,900
No, Ed! No!

1179
01:51:20,500 --> 01:51:21,800
- Peggy, stay here. 
- No, no..

1180
01:51:21,800 --> 01:51:24,400
Wait in the car with the kids.
Wait...

1181
01:51:24,400 --> 01:51:25,500
Janet!

1182
01:51:28,400 --> 01:51:29,500
Get in the car.

1183
01:51:29,600 --> 01:51:30,600
Come on, come on!

1184
01:51:30,600 --> 01:51:32,400
You too Peggy, come on!

1185
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:40,000
Ed?

1186
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:44,800
Ed?

1187
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:53,800
Ed?

1188
01:51:55,400 --> 01:51:56,500
Come on!

1189
01:51:58,300 --> 01:51:59,400
Ed!

1190
01:52:00,700 --> 01:52:01,900
It won’t open.

1191
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:06,000
- Let me try.
- Shit!

1192
01:52:06,800 --> 01:52:07,800
We have to break it down!

1193
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:10,000
- Alright, wait here…
- Break it!

1194
01:52:11,200 --> 01:52:12,500
Ed hon, wait right there.

1195
01:52:12,900 --> 01:52:15,600
- Wait, Vic will be right back.
- I can’t wait! 

1196
01:52:15,700 --> 01:52:16,900
I’m going on to her.

1197
01:52:16,900 --> 01:52:18,100
No, Ed don't!

1198
01:52:18,100 --> 01:52:19,000
Stop!

1199
01:52:19,100 --> 01:52:20,100
You can’t fight this alone.

1200
01:52:23,600 --> 01:52:24,900
She needs our help.

1201
01:52:25,200 --> 01:52:28,700
Ed, please! Please just wait for me..

1202
01:52:29,100 --> 01:52:30,800
Please wait for me.

1203
01:52:38,500 --> 01:52:39,800
I can’t lose you.

1204
01:52:40,700 --> 01:52:42,400
I'm so scared.

1205
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:47,100
I know.

1206
01:52:48,700 --> 01:52:49,700
Me too.

1207
01:52:50,600 --> 01:52:52,100
But I have to help her.

1208
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:55,700
But what about my vision?

1209
01:52:58,100 --> 01:52:59,900
I know I made a promise to you honey..

1210
01:53:02,300 --> 01:53:03,700
but I have to do this.

1211
01:53:06,700 --> 01:53:07,900
I love you, Lorraine.

1212
01:53:08,300 --> 01:53:10,200
Ed, no!

1213
01:53:10,300 --> 01:53:11,700
No!

1214
01:53:11,700 --> 01:53:12,900
Don’t go!

1215
01:53:14,600 --> 01:53:16,400

<i> No! </i>

1217
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000

1218
01:53:27,500 --> 01:53:28,600

1219
01:55:05,100 --> 01:55:06,900
Janet, where are you?

01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:23,500

Janet!

1223
01:56:26,900 --> 01:56:28,300
<i> Help me! </i>

01:56:28,500 --> 01:56:29,600
Janet!

1225
01:56:36,200 --> 01:56:38,900
In the Name of the Father, 
and the Son 
and the Holy Spirit.

1226
01:57:02,300 --> 01:57:03,400
What’s your name?

1227
01:57:04,400 --> 01:57:05,800
What’s..

1228
01:57:06,100 --> 01:57:08,500
What’s your name?

1229
01:57:18,900 --> 01:57:20,700
I do know your name.

1230
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:22,200
I asked you.

1231
01:57:22,300 --> 01:57:23,900
Tell me who you are!

1232
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:25,100
And you told me..

1233
01:57:26,100 --> 01:57:27,700
You told me your name.

1234
01:57:30,400 --> 01:57:32,000
And I wrote it down!

1235
01:57:37,700 --> 01:57:38,800
I need my Bible.

1236
01:57:39,100 --> 01:57:41,500
Why? What’s happening? What?

1237
01:57:54,700 --> 01:57:56,900
The demon’s name
gives us power over it.

1238
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:05,400
<i> V-A-L-A-K </i>

Don’t!

And I do know your name.

1271
02:01:44,200 --> 02:01:45,600
You are Valak.

1272
02:01:46,200 --> 02:01:47,700
The difiler.

1273
02:01:47,800 --> 02:01:51,400
The profane.
The marquis of snakes.

1274
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:56,400
In the name of the Father, 
the Son and the Holy spirit.

1275
02:01:56,400 --> 02:02:00,600
I condemn you back to Hell!

No!

- I have you.
- Ed!

1279
02:02:20,500 --> 02:02:22,600
Dear God. 
Janet!

1280
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:25,500
- Oh my gosh!
- Alright!.

1281
02:02:26,600 --> 02:02:29,300
- Ed, are you okay?
- Check on her.

1282
02:02:29,400 --> 02:02:33,000
Janet? Oh my God!
Is she alright?

1283
02:02:33,100 --> 02:02:34,500
I'll call an ambulance.

1284
02:02:35,200 --> 02:02:37,600
Sit up.

1285
02:02:37,600 --> 02:02:40,600
Here you go, take a big deep breath.

1286
02:02:41,500 --> 02:02:43,400
Take a deep breath.
There you go.

1287
02:03:22,800 --> 02:03:24,300
He'll be fine.

1288
02:03:36,200 --> 02:03:37,700
She looked alright.

1289
02:03:38,700 --> 02:03:42,400
- You saved her.
- No.

1290
02:03:43,700 --> 02:03:45,200
You saved us.

1291
02:03:47,400 --> 02:03:49,000
Didn’t I tell you it was meant to be?

1292
02:03:51,900 --> 02:03:53,300
But you believed in me.

1293
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:02,800
I couldn't have done it without you.

1294
02:04:10,400 --> 02:04:12,200
Thanks for coming back for us.

1295
02:04:17,300 --> 02:04:19,400
Come here, sit down. 
Sit down.

1296
02:04:25,600 --> 02:04:26,600
You know..

1297
02:04:28,300 --> 02:04:30,000
This has kept me safe

1298
02:04:31,200 --> 02:04:32,600
since I was a kid.

1299
02:04:34,400 --> 02:04:36,000
I want you to have it.

1300
02:04:41,800 --> 02:04:43,400
And when you grow up..

1301
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,800
You find someone who needs it,
