1
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,270
- Dad. Faster.
- I'm pushing eighty, son.

2
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,391
If we get caught,
it's all your fault.

3
00:01:01,415 --> 00:01:03,480
- Was not.
- Was so.

4
00:01:03,504 --> 00:01:06,971
You just had to screw around with
that stupid cat. I'm glad it broke.

5
00:01:06,995 --> 00:01:10,354
- You want me to punch you in the mouth?
- Boys, knock it off.

6
00:01:10,355 --> 00:01:14,018
Do something constructive. Why don't
you practice your football plays?

7
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:16,722
Ouch! He hit me.

8
00:01:16,723 --> 00:01:18,510
- Breeze.
- Yes, sir.

9
00:01:19,344 --> 00:01:22,951
Here's a good one -
red dog, Omaha, 22.

10
00:01:22,952 --> 00:01:25,949
I know that one.
It's the hook-and-ladder play.

11
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,150
We flank each other...

12
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,230
Watch out!

13
00:01:37,774 --> 00:01:40,910
- You boys OK? You all right?
- Yes, sir.

14
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:51,688
We are high centered up.
I got to get you inside.

15
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,119
Come on, boys. Come on.
Let's go.

16
00:02:09,069 --> 00:02:11,350
Hello. Hello.

17
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,830
Come on.

18
00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:16,298
I'm sure it's all right.
You boys stay in here.

19
00:02:16,327 --> 00:02:18,526
I've gotta get that truck back
on the road. Y'all understand?

20
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:21,366
Let us help.
No, you're safer in here.

21
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,021
Breeze, you're in charge.

22
00:02:23,022 --> 00:02:25,390
- Yes, sir.
- You got that, Willie?

23
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:43,046
- This is all your fault.
- He's... He's going to be OK.

24
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:47,910
- You know nothing can hurt dad.
- Still all your fault.

25
00:03:08,902 --> 00:03:11,990
- What's happening? Breeze?
- I don't know.

26
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:19,390
Boys!

27
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,326
Boys!

28
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:28,446
- Dad!
- Dad! Dad!

29
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,990
- Daddy.
- Daddy!

30
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:38,510
- Daddy! Help!
- Somebody, please help!

31
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,550
- Right there.
- We got confirmation, guys.

32
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,366
Looks like our projected course
for Tammy is on the money.

33
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:37,846
Upgrade it from a tropical storm to
a category-one hurricane.

34
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,646
Hurricane force winds, diameters,
up to 500 miles.

35
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:43,326
Looks like it is going
to hit Alabama and Florida.

36
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,030
- Get me the latest surface readings.
- They're warm. Way too warm.

37
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:50,406
The Gulf's at 91 degrees,
200 miles out.

38
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,778
The NHC has 98 on
the coastal buoys,

39
00:04:52,779 --> 00:04:54,598
plus the Azores-Bermuda
high-pressure system

40
00:04:54,622 --> 00:04:57,088
- is exceptionally weak.
- Impressive, Miss Schooler.

41
00:04:57,089 --> 00:04:59,984
Ah, De Molinos, get me Will Rutledge,
and Miss Schooler,

42
00:04:59,985 --> 00:05:02,140
I want you to run some numbers
on the spiral bands,

43
00:05:02,164 --> 00:05:06,150
- and get back to me ASAP.
- I'll have it in five.

44
00:05:06,822 --> 00:05:10,697
Yeah, I need Will Rutledge.
Yes, it's important.

45
00:05:15,484 --> 00:05:17,926
<i>- Is this Dr Rutledge?</i>
- You got him.

46
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,806
<i>Director Frobisher would
like to speak with you.</i>

47
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,150
Sure enough, put him on.

48
00:05:23,717 --> 00:05:25,995
- I got Will.
- Alright. Hey, Will.

49
00:05:25,996 --> 00:05:27,066
Hey, buddy.

50
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:30,046
Now my central pressure is dropping
like a stone. What you got?

51
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:33,028
Satellite has got it at
999 millibars now.

52
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:36,066
So far, your Dominator's
in sync.

53
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:39,633
- So, I need those drones airborne quick.
- I'm on it.

54
00:05:39,683 --> 00:05:40,763
Trust me, I'm doing it.

55
00:05:40,787 --> 00:05:43,830
I don't want to stay out here
any longer than I have to.

56
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:54,006
<i>25 years ago, Hurricane Andrew
laid waste to this town.</i>

57
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:56,606
And now Tammy's here
to do it all over again.

58
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,750
But this time,
no-one's going to die.

59
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:02,006
<i>- Yes sir!</i>
- That's why I called the mandatory evac.

60
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,409
We got this, Chief.

61
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:06,279
OK, now once every last car
makes it out of town,

62
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,526
the assigned officers to make sure
their roadblocks are set up.

63
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:12,766
I don't want any looters heading
back into town. Not on my watch.

64
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,790
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>
- OK, now head out.

65
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:24,406
Excuse me there, Sheriff Dixon,
this here storm don't look like

66
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:27,328
it's going to amount to much.
We got to evacuate?

67
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,966
Now, Clayton, best
to evacuate first,

68
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,797
and then double-guess yourself later.

69
00:06:31,821 --> 00:06:34,930
Now, be a good citizen
and get a move on.

70
00:06:34,954 --> 00:06:36,470
- Come on.
- Yes, sir.

71
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:58,030
'Braveness is the resistance
to concern, mastery of panic,

72
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,166
'not absence of anxiety.'

73
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,886
Mark Twain.

74
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,366
Spare me your poetry today, Connor.

75
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:08,566
I can't help it,
it's in my Irish soul.

76
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:11,326
Your Irish soul left Ireland
two generations ago.

77
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:15,040
No, my parents brought me
over here when I was five.

78
00:07:15,064 --> 00:07:16,546
I didn't know that.

79
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,172
There's a lot of things that you
don't know about me.

80
00:07:19,173 --> 00:07:20,966
Still got two passports.

81
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,366
Gonna retire back there
when all this is over.

82
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:26,366
And here I've been stuck on
milk runs with you for a year,

83
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:29,830
and I thought I knew all there
was to know.

84
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:36,206
What is the hurry?

85
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:39,523
We do have to bank this load before the
storm hits. So, there's that.

86
00:07:39,547 --> 00:07:41,346
- Move over.
- What?

87
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:48,766
This is Corbin, buckle up.

88
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:53,150
You know those bumps in the road
you hear about, here they come.

89
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,926
You know, I think you're
a little psychotic.

90
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,230
I think you are a little bit right.

91
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,866
You're going to ruin
somebody's tobacco crop.

92
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,190
Well, little less
cancer in the world.

93
00:08:23,115 --> 00:08:24,407
Whoa!

94
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:38,286
- Ask your brother if he's reading it.
- You reading this, Clem?

95
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:41,750
Hold on, bro, it's checking.
Keep trying, man.

96
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,913
All right, hold on.

97
00:08:47,287 --> 00:08:49,003
All right, that should do it, bro.

98
00:08:49,004 --> 00:08:52,430
Yeah, up link full strength.
Good job, close her up.

99
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:00,230
Money is honey.

100
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:33,750
They're underestimating you.

101
00:09:50,962 --> 00:09:53,446
- Morning, ma'am, sir.
- Morning.

102
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:56,366
- Where are the two other trucks?
- They couldn't keep up.

103
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:01,126
- I've got a feeling not many can.
<i>- Clear.</i>

104
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:04,590
Welcome back, you two.
Open it up.

105
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:13,615
Niles, you still there? I've got
them launched. You get the readings?

106
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:15,342
Yeah, they're in sync.

107
00:10:15,343 --> 00:10:17,581
Stick around, it's only
going to be a cat two.

108
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:20,551
Get some new measurements.
You're sitting in a tank, for Christ sakes.

109
00:10:20,606 --> 00:10:21,998
No thanks.

110
00:10:21,999 --> 00:10:23,920
You're underestimating
her, I can smell it.

111
00:10:23,944 --> 00:10:26,629
Yeah, while you're smelling it,
we are reading it

112
00:10:26,653 --> 00:10:29,606
from carefully calibrated
scientific instruments.

113
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:33,086
Jim was just spiraling inward at
a crazy rate. Millibars 985.

114
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:35,339
You ever seen
a millibar dive that quick?

115
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,442
- Not consistent with our projections.
- Damn your projections.

116
00:10:38,443 --> 00:10:41,066
I'm telling you, this one's going
to be off the scale. Trust me.

117
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:43,701
Dinner at the crab shack,
if it gets higher than a two.

118
00:10:43,702 --> 00:10:45,206
Now stop thinking
about your stomach,

119
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,227
and your government expense
account's gonna pay for it.

120
00:10:47,251 --> 00:10:49,646
You should get the National Guard
down here, before it's too late.

121
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:52,506
I respect you Will, you're a
first-rate meteorologist.

122
00:10:52,507 --> 00:10:55,126
But I can't just traipse into
the President's office,

123
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:58,390
- and offer up your gut now, can I?
- Well, you'll wish you had.

124
00:10:58,414 --> 00:11:01,659
I've never met anyone so afraid of
the very thing they were fascinated by.

125
00:11:01,683 --> 00:11:03,966
Yeah, I've got a few
contradictions, but so do you.

126
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:05,846
Like eating candy bars
on a strict diet.

127
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,790
Yeah, now you mention it.

128
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:12,886
- Wrap it up, and come home, Will.
- Yeah, I am home, buddy.

129
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:15,150
I am home.

130
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:23,030
Even after 11 years of this,
I never get used to that sight.

131
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:26,286
I hate old money. It's greasy,
it smells,

132
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:29,966
it's been up 1,000 noses,
and buried in too many G-strings.

133
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:32,146
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

134
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:35,397
The best part of this lame-ass job
is watching it turn into confetti.

135
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:43,298
- Sergeant Deary.
- Yes, ma'am.

136
00:11:43,299 --> 00:11:45,646
What's with the backup?
Why haven't these been shredded?

137
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:48,006
The shredder's been
down since you left.

138
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:50,070
- All right, let's get them in.
- Copy that.

139
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,750
All right.

140
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:29,006
It's working absolutely perfect one
second, the next second, stops.

141
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,606
I've got all my
guys looking at it,

142
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,366
and no-one around here
can figure out why.

143
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:35,086
So, you got here not a minute
too soon, Miss...

144
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,206
Bendietrich.

145
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,230
You can call me Sasha,
Agent Moreno,

146
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,189
because you're the one
paying the bills.

147
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:44,394
Sasha it is. So, how long's it going to
take to get this thing back online?

148
00:12:44,395 --> 00:12:46,486
We'll run some diagnostics,
and get to the root of it.

149
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,740
We'll have you shredding
your heart out by lunch.

150
00:12:48,741 --> 00:12:49,977
That would be great.

151
00:12:50,001 --> 00:12:52,206
Hundreds of millions,
and a hurricane are not exactly

152
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,806
the best cocktail on the menu.

153
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:56,308
You know a thing or two
about cocktails, right, Randy.

154
00:12:56,346 --> 00:12:57,630
Excuse me.

155
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:02,646
Enough of your jokes right now,
Corbin.

156
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:04,526
Maybe the less you say
to me the better.

157
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:08,566
All right, I'm in and out. Let's
just keep it professional, right.

158
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,310
- Thanks.
- Right this way.

159
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:18,815
Morris, Agent Corbin reporting in.
Good time, bad time?

160
00:13:18,816 --> 00:13:22,973
Er, I've got a couple of
bits. Is everything OK?

161
00:13:22,997 --> 00:13:25,846
- Yeah.
- Cargo offloaded?

162
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:29,877
Yeah. It's all here, with about 300
million of its cousins.

163
00:13:29,878 --> 00:13:33,326
- The shredder's down, though.
- Yeah, I know. Addressed it.

164
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:36,646
Look, don't forget that 600 million
is your responsibility

165
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:40,286
- until it is destroyed, OK.
- You've got no problems with that.

166
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:43,006
Turns out I'm all right at
babysitting old money,

167
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,606
it's not the field, though.

168
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:48,166
Hey, I went to bat
for you after Utah.

169
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:51,166
If it wasn't for me, you
wouldn't even have a job right now.

170
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,270
And I appreciate that.

171
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:58,385
It's not really a job. I think
we both know what this is.

172
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:02,326
Look, I, I made a bad call.

173
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:05,615
But no-one can punish me like
I already punish myself.

174
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:07,871
Casey, don't do this.

175
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:12,284
Listen, if the money is my
responsibility,

176
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:14,446
I'd love to get a reset
on the vault code.

177
00:14:14,447 --> 00:14:16,884
Hurricanes give people bad ideas.

178
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:21,311
OK. Consider it authorized.

179
00:14:21,335 --> 00:14:23,390
- Thanks.
- And Casey...

180
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:28,270
take care of yourself, OK.

181
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:49,306
Yeah, this is Breeze,
from Rutledge Tow and Repair.

182
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:52,086
Leave a message and I probably
won't get back to you.

183
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:54,406
Hey, Breeze, it's Will.
Look, I'm in town.

184
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:57,926
Listen, you got to get...

185
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:03,630
Dammit.

186
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:13,580
Dialing. This CBC stuff
is so corrupted.

187
00:15:13,581 --> 00:15:16,503
Yeah, that's what made
shutting it down so easy.

188
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:19,362
Why do they always hire hacks
with so little talent,

189
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:21,194
when they could have us?

190
00:15:21,195 --> 00:15:23,430
Not enough money in it.

191
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,030
Yes.

192
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:37,990
Yeah, make yourself at home.

193
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:43,486
- Better check your backup power.
- Yeah, don't tell me what to do.

194
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,990
Not saying, I'm just saying.

195
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:53,966
- Oh, boy. It's failed.
- Not good.

196
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:57,566
I know. The job's outsourced to some local,
Breeze Rutledge, it's 555...

197
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,096
Phone's dead.

198
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:02,886
Shit, my cell doesn't
have any bars.

199
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:05,366
Me neither.
Right, where is he?

200
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,706
His shop is off of Baum and Garden.

201
00:16:07,707 --> 00:16:09,067
It's called Rutledge Repairs.

202
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,590
Breeze.

203
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:03,296
All right Mr, rise and shine.

204
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,510
Come on, Breeze, on your
feet. Get dressed buddy.

205
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,726
Oh, I was dreaming, Will.

206
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:15,403
Remember Miss Bishop?
10th grade biology teacher.

207
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:20,848
Never did learn much,
but boy, I was never late.

208
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:24,665
As I remember it, you had a
keen interest in her biology.

209
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,776
What you doing here, Willie?

210
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:38,763
There is a hurricane coming,
and it's going to be a mother.

211
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,270
Some breakfast?

212
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,350
Yeah, and I'm a...

213
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,526
What was her name?

214
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,590
- Jaguar.
- Jaguar.

215
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:59,030
Well, we are what we are, Willie.

216
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:02,240
Can't change people.

217
00:18:02,241 --> 00:18:04,486
You sure as shit
can't change hurricanes.

218
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:08,806
Well, this hurricane can change people
from life to death, so we got to go.

219
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:11,006
Yeah, I've seen them before,
brother.

220
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:14,030
Not like this. I'm telling you,
this is worse than...

221
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,550
The one that killed dad?

222
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:19,870
Yeah.

223
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:24,390
Red dog, Omaha, 22.

224
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,846
They're good hands.

225
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:34,166
You always had good hands.

226
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:36,790
We got to go.

227
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:45,312
You wasted a trip, baby bro.
I ain't gonna leave.

228
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:48,966
Look around, man,
because this...

229
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:51,366
it's my entire life around here.

230
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:54,407
But you got the cash, and the
airplane tickets I sent, right?

231
00:18:54,431 --> 00:18:57,589
Yeah, I got it all right here.

232
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:04,150
Take your pity somewhere else,
please.

233
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,246
You need a fresh start, bro.

234
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:13,286
I make a fresh start
every day, Will.

235
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:16,317
It's just not so fresh by dark.

236
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:19,976
And all I got to do is freshen
it right back up again.

237
00:19:19,977 --> 00:19:22,766
Breeze, if this storm
is what I think it is,

238
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:27,246
they ain't ever seen
anything like it.

239
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:30,721
OK, I'll buy.

240
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:36,109
But you're going to help me board up
the windows first, ain't you?

241
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:41,470
You... You got a hammer?

242
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:51,326
Heard you got phone trouble?
Got a call from a guy named Moreno.

243
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:53,126
There is no clearance
for you here, sir.

244
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:57,258
Corporal, we placed a T20 for
a transponder tower six,

245
00:19:57,259 --> 00:20:00,860
got a lane open, have to shift it
over from the source, which is here.

246
00:20:00,884 --> 00:20:02,266
Sir, we are on lock down,
due to the storm.

247
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:04,486
You need special clearance,
which you do not have.

248
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:08,530
Come on, man, we're just doing
our job here. Let us in.

249
00:20:08,554 --> 00:20:10,646
Sir, this is a federal facility,
I need you to turn

250
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:13,710
this vehicle around,
and I need you to turn around now.

251
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:41,510
- Are we in any danger?
- There's been a breach.

252
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:47,030
You are safe in here,
all this glass is bullet-proof.

253
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:51,150
So I need you to
stay calm, and stay put.

254
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:03,550
- What's going on?
- We're under attack.

255
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:37,710
- What should we do, Connor?
- Take a nap.

256
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:02,350
Come on!

257
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:14,950
- We got a situation?
- What's going on, Mr Perkins?

258
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:19,270
What are you doing?

259
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:20,950
What are you doing?

260
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:36,292
And you said we couldn't do
this with zero casualties?

261
00:22:36,293 --> 00:22:38,624
You may not want to face it now, Connor.

262
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:40,854
But eventually we may have to kill
some people to get what we want.

263
00:22:40,878 --> 00:22:43,182
- Let's get these guys locked up.
- Yeah, let's break out the P90s.

264
00:22:43,206 --> 00:22:44,950
- Let's get the money.
- Amen.

265
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:58,926
It's bullet-proof, man,
you're wasting your time.

266
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,630
What if I say...

267
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:04,166
open sesame?

268
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:08,366
I have a thing about open sesame,
ever since I read Ali Baba as a kid.

269
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:10,710
Drop the gun, Moreno.

270
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:16,346
I should have known there was
something hinky about you two freaks.

271
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:17,624
We two freaks

272
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:20,406
hacked your shredder weeks ago,
so that the money would pile up.

273
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:22,606
Of course, we had
to gamble on the storm,

274
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:25,548
but all of life has its little risks.

275
00:23:25,549 --> 00:23:28,894
Now, we managed to take this place
without spilling a drop of blood.

276
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,886
I want to keep it that way,
so I need your help.

277
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,630
Now, should you choose
not to help us,

278
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:37,246
the no blood rule will be revoked.

279
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:39,006
This is not your money.

280
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:41,727
The government's not going
to give it to your widow, Brenda,

281
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,612
if you fall on your sword
here now, are they?

282
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:48,201
This is a federal facility, man.

283
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:51,217
You know what you're facing
when they catch you.

284
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:55,338
Oh, I'd rather be facing
that, than us.

285
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:59,846
The vault, how long?

286
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:03,086
We have to substitute an I/O device
by loading a hunger striker routine

287
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:05,726
- into one of the monitor's wormholes.
- English. 30 minutes.

288
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,470
Open sesame in 30.

289
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:35,267
One of you Breeze Rutledge?

290
00:24:35,268 --> 00:24:37,544
- Yeah. Who's asking?
- Casey Corbin, Treasury.

291
00:24:37,545 --> 00:24:40,211
Our generator's down, I understand
you're responsible for repairs.

292
00:24:40,235 --> 00:24:44,886
- Yeah, I'll go and get my tools.
- Breeze, what about the boards?

293
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:47,086
My government needs me, Will.

294
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,790
You done this before.

295
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:52,625
You got swindled into a
bunch of free labor huh?

296
00:24:52,626 --> 00:24:55,156
- Apparently so.
- Yeah, I know that game.

297
00:24:55,157 --> 00:24:56,446
This yours?

298
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:59,968
You one of those hurricane chasers?

299
00:24:59,969 --> 00:25:02,154
No, I'm one of those meteorologists.

300
00:25:02,155 --> 00:25:04,567
Anybody who chases hurricanes
got a death wish.

301
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:12,006
OK, let's go and save the world.

302
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:14,658
Will, buddy,

303
00:25:14,659 --> 00:25:16,299
you going to be here
when I get back?

304
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:19,550
- No.
- OK.

305
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:25,710
See you in another five years.

306
00:25:50,935 --> 00:25:52,455
Did real good, kid.

307
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:55,630
Really proud of you.
Done very well.

308
00:25:56,630 --> 00:26:00,446
But tonight, we're going to
be the richest punk

309
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:03,697
- to ever come out of Phyllis Point.
- Nice.

310
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:09,130
So you're a hometown boy?

311
00:26:09,131 --> 00:26:10,446
Uh-huh.

312
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:13,486
But I took the small detour
to Afghanistan and back,

313
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:16,039
but that was just to
break up the monotony.

314
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,306
It'll do that.

315
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:19,592
Now, you see that?

316
00:26:19,803 --> 00:26:24,036
That right there was my
last official glory zone.

317
00:26:24,037 --> 00:26:28,310
Yeah. You're looking at the starting
quarterback in the Gulf port Gators.

318
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,950
'99 to 2001.

319
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:32,670
All winning seasons, mind you.

320
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:39,326
I had six brothers, they ate,
slept and drank football.

321
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,846
- Six brothers?
- Yeah.

322
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:43,950
Shit, lady, I got just one,
and it's a damn minefield.

323
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:51,110
Open it.

324
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:07,150
It's all yours.

325
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:15,310
- What the f...
- Maybe we ran into her bots. Try it again.

326
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:20,306
- Tell me what is going on.
- The code, it's not working.

327
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:23,746
- You told us you hacked it solid.
- We did. We ran it this morning.

328
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:26,779
Then why can't you open it?
This was your only job.

329
00:27:26,803 --> 00:27:28,871
Somebody changed the code.

330
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:35,932
It wasn't me.

331
00:27:35,933 --> 00:27:38,326
That can only come
from Washington.

332
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:42,256
Or the Washington liaison.

333
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:46,018
Casey Corbin.

334
00:27:46,019 --> 00:27:49,067
We can work through our dedicated
cell, do the hack all over.

335
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:53,395
Let's work on two fronts, Connor.

336
00:27:53,396 --> 00:27:55,400
Frears and I will do the
hack all over again,

337
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:57,083
while you find Miss Corbin.

338
00:27:57,107 --> 00:27:59,166
- Time frame?
- Three hours, minimum.

339
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:02,630
- You can do it in two.
- Yes, my love. Two will be fine.

340
00:28:02,631 --> 00:28:05,310
All right. Get to it.

341
00:28:10,132 --> 00:28:11,786
Where is she?

342
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:24,246
If you tell me anything other
than the truth, so help me,

343
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,966
your brains are going
to spill all over this stainless.

344
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:29,086
Where is she?

345
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,966
The gen...

346
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:33,206
The backup generator failed.

347
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:36,750
She went to get the repair guy,
she should have been back by now.

348
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:54,213
This is not good.

349
00:28:55,058 --> 00:28:58,211
Listen, if you want help,
just say the word.

350
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:01,670
Keep low, and keep it running.

351
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:24,510
This is how it's done.

352
00:29:35,938 --> 00:29:39,340
<i>Agent Corbin, we got you scoped.</i>

353
00:29:39,341 --> 00:29:42,230
Drop the gun, give yourself up.

354
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:49,166
We don't want to hurt you,
we just want to talk.

355
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:51,830
Give yourself up.
Don't be stupid.

356
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:59,030
Let's go.

357
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:02,350
Not so fast, Corbin.

358
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:17,910
Go, go, go. Get her.

359
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:21,702
Don't you move.

360
00:30:22,019 --> 00:30:24,406
Easy. I'm just a repair man,
doing a house job.

361
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:27,046
Go get the girl.
You got a tail!

362
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:30,126
Easy. Hell of a day, ain't it?

363
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,710
Hell of a day!

364
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:52,870
Got her pinned.
War monument.

365
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,390
Get in.

366
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:25,366
Thank you.
What the hell was that about?

367
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:28,686
- The Treasury's being robbed.
- You left with my brother,

368
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:31,766
- I didn't see him. Where is he?
- I think they have him.

369
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:34,594
- Think who has him?
- The crew that somehow managed

370
00:31:34,595 --> 00:31:36,366
to knock over a
maximum security facility.

371
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:37,846
We got to go back.

372
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:41,292
Wait. These guys must be pretty
heavy hitters to pull this off.

373
00:31:41,293 --> 00:31:44,043
They're not just going to hand him
over because we ask. They need him.

374
00:31:44,067 --> 00:31:45,566
Need him for what?

375
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:48,531
The backup generator's down,
he's the only one that can fix it.

376
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:50,630
They're going to need
power to get in the vault.

377
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:53,146
So once he's through that,
they're through with him.

378
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:56,246
- I've got to call DC.
- You have sat?

379
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:58,846
- Damn, he's shot my satellite link.
- Shit! Shit!

380
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:02,126
Hey, hey, hey, we got to stay
focused, OK?

381
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:05,658
We are going to get help.
Just... Let's stay calm.

382
00:32:05,659 --> 00:32:07,949
Listen, lady, we are
about to be crushed

383
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:09,201
by the biggest storm
of the century.

384
00:32:09,225 --> 00:32:10,566
I don't think you know
what that means.

385
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:14,029
It means no-one is going to come here
and volunteer to help until it's over,

386
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:16,183
and at that point it's going
to be too late for my brother.

387
00:32:16,207 --> 00:32:17,625
Look, I'm with you.

388
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,710
You know any local cops?

389
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:23,833
Yeah, I guess. It's not like
anything changes round here.

390
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:27,445
OK!

391
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:29,138
Best play we got.

392
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:35,630
He's the generator guy.

393
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:41,535
Yeah, Breeze Rutledge, that's him.

394
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:43,721
How's it going, Randy?

395
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:47,303
Well, you know where it
is, get to it.

396
00:32:47,304 --> 00:32:49,569
- Try a zigamorph.
- I already called the dummy procedure,

397
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:52,246
there to force a flash of the
optimizers as registered coloring,

398
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,630
that's getting us somewhere.

399
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:02,110
Eyes front. Eyes front!

400
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,950
Hello.

401
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:33,366
What are you people doing here?

402
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:36,366
The town's under
mandatory evacuation.

403
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:39,326
I'm sure glad you don't listen to
your own orders. Jimmy, it's me.

404
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,526
Willie? Willie Rutledge, is that you?

405
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:45,669
Jimmy, listen, they got my brother
tied up in the Treasury.

406
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:48,366
- Who's got him?
- The Treasury's being robbed.

407
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:51,246
Casey Corbin, ATF.
How many men can you roundup?

408
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:54,486
I knew today was going
to be a shit-show.

409
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:57,150
Come on into my office,
tell me all about it.

410
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:00,806
How many of them are there?
I only had eyes on two,

411
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,566
but they took out 14
guards, high-tech security,

412
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:06,046
there's bound to be more.

413
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:08,166
So they're highly organized.

414
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:10,286
I can't confirm casualties,

415
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:14,166
but there was no blood, so hoping
there's more than one hostage.

416
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:17,110
We're going to
have to do something about that.

417
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:22,046
You, Missy, throw down
your weapon, now.

418
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:26,643
- Oh, no, Jimmy, you ain't in on it?
- Well, I'm afraid so, Willie.

419
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:30,526
You watch those semis rolling through

420
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:33,686
this shithole day after day,
filled with money.

421
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:37,008
You know it's just going
to the shredder.

422
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:40,406
Kind of gets you thinking, Willie.
You know?

423
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:42,926
Gives a man ideas.

424
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:45,750
Gun down, now.

425
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:56,597
Very good. I like a gal
who follows orders.

426
00:34:56,790 --> 00:35:00,486
- Dixon here, you read me?
- You got her?

427
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:06,070
Yeah, pretty little thing,
all wrapped up in a red ribbon.

428
00:35:06,094 --> 00:35:07,486
We need her alive.

429
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:09,566
Do what you want with
the good Samaritan.

430
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:10,966
Zander is on his way.

431
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:14,670
Yeah, well, you tell him not
to dawdle, you hear? Over.

432
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:18,086
Connor Perkins is the inside man.

433
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:22,929
Not bad, huh? For two old guys they
were going to put out to pasture.

434
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:25,166
600 million sure puts

435
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:29,470
a whole different complexion
on retirement, I'd say.

436
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:46,790
Go, go, go, go!

437
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:59,350
Red ribbon, my ass!
Shut up and drive.

438
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:04,156
They are on our tail.

439
00:36:04,721 --> 00:36:06,511
Come on, can't you go any faster?

440
00:36:06,535 --> 00:36:09,343
I've got my foot to the floor, man.
She's going as fast as she can.

441
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:10,910
Give me your gun.

442
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:23,750
That thing's built like a tank.

443
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:29,270
Oh, shit!

444
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:34,510
I'm tapped. What?

445
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:37,606
I'm out of bullets.
How did that happen?

446
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,430
I shot them all.

447
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:46,326
How far back are they?
100 yards, and closing.

448
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:48,190
Help me with my harness.

449
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:56,950
OK, now you.

450
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:08,166
Do you trust me?
I need you to trust me.

451
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:11,150
- What? Do you trust me?
- Yeah, what the hell, Will?

452
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:16,950
Because this is going to be harsh.

453
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:26,310
Here comes the harsh part.

454
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,870
You OK?

455
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:46,270
Never do that to me again.

456
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:49,030
I had to do something.

457
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:54,630
I guess it worked.

458
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:07,750
Wait, wait, wait.

459
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:12,190
Aren't you out of bullets?
They don't know that.

460
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:34,830
Jackpot.

461
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:16,591
Uh... Drink?

462
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:21,910
I'm not naturally a violent man, but
if this thing is not working soon,

463
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:25,566
I'm going to show you
another side of me.

464
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:28,470
Well, I'm not naturally
a worried man,

465
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:33,246
but how do I know when I do, fix
this thing, you won't just kill me?

466
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:34,886
You don't!

467
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:39,230
But I would not make me think
about ultimatums, just fix it.

468
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:46,950
Just do it. I am sick of
waiting for people.

469
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:09,966
Well, we can't keep running like
this, which 11's going to kill us.

470
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:12,646
Well, we can't leave,
and we can't call for help,

471
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:14,830
lines are down,
cell phones are dead.

472
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:19,166
When I left, all the
cell phones were down,

473
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:22,606
but those hackers
were still working.

474
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:23,766
How's that?

475
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:25,669
Maybe they got a dedicated line,

476
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:28,350
one with a satellite up link,
like I used to have.

477
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:32,310
If they were smart, they'd have
installed it ahead of time.

478
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:34,106
The only way they can
get the new code

479
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:37,126
is to hack back into
the DC mainframe.

480
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:39,526
If they had a dedicated
line, we could find it,

481
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:42,926
we could cut it, hole up,
and wait for help.

482
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:45,870
Anything on here that
could pick that up?

483
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:51,190
You know what, this one, this
reads non-ion identity,

484
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:53,606
which is basically radio.

485
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:56,686
Really? Great.

486
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:58,750
So we just search Gulf port.

487
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,430
This town just woke up
from the 1940s,

488
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:04,286
there can't be but three cell phone
towers in this whole place.

489
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:07,326
This one will tell us which
one of those is active.

490
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:08,966
Mr Rutledge, you are my...

491
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:11,190
Dr Rutledge.

492
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:14,630
I have a PhD in
synoptic meteorology.

493
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:20,926
- Dr Rutledge, you are my kind of expert.
- Why thank you.

494
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:24,230
Zander, come in. Do you copy?

495
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:28,910
Zander, pick up the walkie.
Where are you?

496
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:34,246
There was an accident,
our car is totaled.

497
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:36,726
Are you all right?

498
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:38,966
Oh, boy.

499
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:40,966
My arm's busted.

500
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:43,006
We're pretty shook up, man,
but I'm fine.

501
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:46,406
The sheriff has broken his
arm, it looks pretty bad.

502
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:48,726
Cut the shit. Where's the girl?

503
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:50,966
Have you got the girl?

504
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:53,350
She got away, Connor.

505
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:58,470
You screwed up the
easiest chance we had.

506
00:41:59,349 --> 00:42:01,861
We're outside the
Atlantic Hotel.

507
00:42:01,862 --> 00:42:03,806
It's getting savage out here.

508
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:06,016
You've got to come get us.

509
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:09,446
Hey, Zander, they're
coming to get you.

510
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:12,246
I don't understand, if you've always
been afraid of these storms,

511
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:15,286
how the hell you ended
up with this job?

512
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:18,070
You could always be in some
nice, dry TV studio.

513
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:21,366
Up next, we have Weatherman Willie,

514
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:23,726
bringing you news of a big
storm across the Gulf.

515
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,806
Right, thank you, Casey.
Yeah, that's right,

516
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:28,846
we've got 500 miles of Armageddon
on its way to crush your house

517
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:31,686
and destroy your life.
All joking aside,

518
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:34,886
that is case number one
for a man-made climate change.

519
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:36,566
The ocean's warming,
it just gives

520
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:38,766
more and more
energy to these hurricanes.

521
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:40,326
Right now, the limit's cat five,

522
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:42,006
pretty soon it's going
to be cat six,

523
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:43,646
and seven, and so on, and so forth.

524
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:46,686
By that time you're killing
hundreds and thousands of people.

525
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:49,166
If we could just figure out
their secrets, you know,

526
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:51,006
me and my colleagues,
people like us,

527
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:53,470
we could mitigate
how these storms occur.

528
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:57,110
Maybe even stop them altogether.

529
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,390
Seems...

530
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:03,990
seems real personal for you.

531
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:07,782
I just hope you never have
to watch someone you love

532
00:43:07,783 --> 00:43:09,310
die right in front of your eyes.

533
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,470
I have.

534
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:17,030
Back in Utah...

535
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:22,269
I made a bad decision,
got someone killed.

536
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,830
I'm sorry to hear that, Casey.

537
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:34,030
It's like a weight you never
really put down, do you?

538
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:37,110
No, you do not.

539
00:43:39,476 --> 00:43:40,753
Come on.

540
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:44,030
Oh, God.

541
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:51,630
Come on. Come on.

542
00:44:02,797 --> 00:44:04,940
That tower's definitely active.

543
00:44:04,941 --> 00:44:06,298
Has to be them.

544
00:44:06,299 --> 00:44:09,146
Probably, but we got winds 143,
that's a cat four.

545
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:10,606
No way we could work
on it up there.

546
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:12,166
What if we bring it down to us?

547
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:14,646
There's a pretty serious
winch on this thing.

548
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:18,230
- You think you could do the job?
- That's one idea.

549
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,926
OK. Hey, where you going?

550
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:31,846
I can handle a cable,
but I can't handle

551
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:33,886
that peashooter,
in case we get company.

552
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:36,027
I need you to stay here
and watch my back for me.

553
00:44:36,051 --> 00:44:37,206
All right.

554
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:40,830
- This is the winch. Out. In.
- Copy.

555
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:46,430
- Be careful.
- You, too.

556
00:45:52,774 --> 00:45:53,999
Jesus!

557
00:46:00,235 --> 00:46:02,150
Will!

558
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:26,206
Casey, tow the line!

559
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:30,369
- What?
- Tow the line!

560
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:40,830
Oh, no! Tow the line!

561
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:46,350
Wait, go back.

562
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:52,670
Somebody is up there.

563
00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:57,470
Shit!

564
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:12,559
Jackie, stay back.

565
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:39,390
- Numbers are coming in.
- How many numbers to the code?

566
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:42,271
33. Here they come. Six.

567
00:47:42,403 --> 00:47:44,595
OK, this will take a little
bit of time, just be patient.

568
00:47:44,619 --> 00:47:46,743
I can be patient for 600 million.

569
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:49,886
Jackie. Connor, wait.

570
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:52,510
She's gone, man. She's gone!

571
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:55,326
We got to move. Now!

572
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:57,750
Go get that woman.
I'll cover you.

573
00:48:19,790 --> 00:48:22,446
- Can't you make it go any faster?
- It's a computer...

574
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:24,950
it's working at
the speed of light, thank you, Rice.

575
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:47,686
The spikes!
The spikes!

576
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:50,390
- What?
- Shoot the spikes.

577
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:03,710
- 36, 16!
- 4 more. OK, we've got 3 more to go.

578
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:23,310
We've got 1 more. What?

579
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:27,830
Yes, yes! Hell yeah!

580
00:49:34,702 --> 00:49:36,583
I'm out of ammo, we've got to go.

581
00:49:36,607 --> 00:49:38,126
We are still tethered to the tower.

582
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:40,950
- We are sitting ducks.
- Watch out!

583
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:51,246
You work here, get us unhooked.
I'll hold them off.

584
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:53,670
With what?

585
00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:12,658
- It froze.
- I can see that, shithead.

586
00:50:12,659 --> 00:50:14,206
The line's been cut.

587
00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:17,190
- Way to go, Casey.
- What did you say?

588
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:19,229
I said, 'Way to go, Casey.'

589
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:32,310
Let him go! Stop it!

590
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:38,030
All right, stop!

591
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:55,150
Oh, geez!

592
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:07,166
Got it!

593
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:11,310
Perkins, let's get out of
here, or we are all going to die!

594
00:51:14,850 --> 00:51:17,710
We are unhooked.

595
00:51:31,867 --> 00:51:33,350
God damn that hick.

596
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:43,110
Lucky timing, I guess.

597
00:51:54,510 --> 00:51:57,621
It's here in my notes,
The volterpolic AJAX.

598
00:51:57,622 --> 00:51:59,881
One wrong entry, and
it shuts down for 48 hours.

599
00:51:59,905 --> 00:52:02,157
Yep, that's what I thought
now rock this...

600
00:52:02,158 --> 00:52:05,070
it's a two integer number.

601
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:10,926
So after the initialization,
I analyzed the previous numbers,

602
00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:13,846
it's a Marshall-Fibonacci
sequence, see.

603
00:52:13,870 --> 00:52:18,697
Apply it forward, and it will narrow
the probability of the 33rd number.

604
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:23,296
All right, we got two civilians,
possibly armed.

605
00:52:23,297 --> 00:52:26,276
We got at least three hostiles,
all with P90s,

606
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:28,156
and they got Moreno.

607
00:52:28,157 --> 00:52:30,750
- Get us out of here, we'll take them.
- Yes, sir.

608
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:38,790
Holy shit, he's trying to
free the soldiers.

609
00:52:57,830 --> 00:52:59,846
Had to go for two hours.

610
00:52:59,870 --> 00:53:03,510
- All this water.
- Good idea.

611
00:53:05,807 --> 00:53:07,462
Let me get this straight,

612
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:10,510
you're the only one with the code,
and that's why they need you?

613
00:53:10,582 --> 00:53:11,840
Right.

614
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:14,812
Why don't you do it?

615
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:16,909
Why don't I do what?

616
00:53:16,910 --> 00:53:19,246
Open the safe.
It's not your money.

617
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:21,110
I can't.

618
00:53:22,110 --> 00:53:24,385
Can't is not an answer. I just can't.

619
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:26,550
That's the job right now,
as shitty as it is.

620
00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:31,366
You don't understand. You can't just
walk into a hostage negotiation...

621
00:53:31,390 --> 00:53:34,246
You want to beat them at their
own game, they need you alive,

622
00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:36,309
so it's a safe game for you.

623
00:53:36,310 --> 00:53:38,123
I can't say the same
for me and Breeze.

624
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:41,307
He could lose his life because
you want your old job back.

625
00:53:41,331 --> 00:53:42,288
No.

626
00:53:42,312 --> 00:53:44,266
- I'd say that's right on the money.
- Will, listen,

627
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:47,066
as long as I have the code,
they don't have the money.

628
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:50,326
As long as they don't have
the money, the hostages live.

629
00:53:50,350 --> 00:53:54,150
If they get it,
they kill all the witnesses.

630
00:53:57,070 --> 00:53:59,190
Follow me.

631
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:01,870
- What?
- Come on.

632
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:08,150
- I'm following a damned weatherman.
- You'll learn to love it.

633
00:54:16,310 --> 00:54:19,266
- You OK, boss?
- No, I'm not OK.

634
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:21,910
- My arm's busted.
- Get me some Vicodin.

635
00:54:25,659 --> 00:54:27,390
Get him in. Get him in.

636
00:54:35,790 --> 00:54:38,246
You all right?

637
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:41,566
What happened?
Where's the Fed?

638
00:54:41,590 --> 00:54:45,246
We couldn't bring her in. The
storm's the other side of hell.

639
00:54:45,270 --> 00:54:47,806
Where's Zander?
Where's my brother?

640
00:54:47,830 --> 00:54:49,670
He didn't make it.

641
00:54:52,110 --> 00:54:55,766
- What do you mean?
- He's dead.

642
00:54:55,790 --> 00:54:57,270
Jackie, too. Both of them.

643
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:00,950
Who did it?

644
00:55:04,430 --> 00:55:07,086
The Fed? That bitch.

645
00:55:07,110 --> 00:55:09,790
No, no, don't, listen,
listen to me, Rice...

646
00:55:11,510 --> 00:55:12,966
We don't get the money,

647
00:55:12,990 --> 00:55:16,510
they both died for nothing,
and we are left with nothing.

648
00:55:17,050 --> 00:55:21,406
That's all we got left, me
and you. The money, OK.

649
00:55:21,430 --> 00:55:25,470
You know, there is
a strange irony in all this.

650
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:29,846
It was us who planned to
use the hurricane,

651
00:55:29,870 --> 00:55:33,406
and by some crazy twist of fate,

652
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:38,326
we collide with somebody who
knows it better than us.

653
00:55:38,350 --> 00:55:41,566
Boys. What the hell?

654
00:55:41,590 --> 00:55:46,110
Simple, the sheriff had a
plan within a plan all along.

655
00:55:47,270 --> 00:55:51,990
It's like I said,
fate works in crazy ways.

656
00:55:52,830 --> 00:55:55,366
Like when I was sitting in a bar,
on my own,

657
00:55:55,390 --> 00:55:58,133
bitching about my lot in life,

658
00:55:58,134 --> 00:56:01,879
and right next to me was
another man doing the same thing.

659
00:56:01,903 --> 00:56:04,337
What are you telling me this for?

660
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:09,196
- I was there, you idiot.
- Well, not such an idiot.

661
00:56:09,596 --> 00:56:11,756
Obviously.

662
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:17,830
Everything was planned perfectly.

663
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:23,086
All we needed was
one little hurricane,

664
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:25,246
but you screwed it up,

665
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:29,286
because you didn't have the balls
to pull this off in the right way.

666
00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:32,230
So everything went sideways.

667
00:56:33,470 --> 00:56:35,230
Well, I'm taking over now.

668
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:39,686
Boys, we are going
to get that gal,

669
00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:43,190
and cattle prod her privates,
until she gives us the code.

670
00:56:45,390 --> 00:56:48,966
And after that...

671
00:56:48,990 --> 00:56:51,486
the money's all mine.

672
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:55,006
You hear? You hear me loud
and clear, boy?

673
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:56,550
No, hold your fire.

674
00:56:57,630 --> 00:57:02,046
Well, that was loud,
and very clear.

675
00:57:02,070 --> 00:57:06,110
- I have a proposal.
- Speak your piece.

676
00:57:06,950 --> 00:57:11,510
Stick with me, and I promise you
all 20 million apiece.

677
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:16,950
I don't mind partners,
but I do hate witnesses.

678
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:20,990
What's it going to be?

679
00:57:23,070 --> 00:57:27,353
Well, I think
we can work with that.

680
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:31,960
But there will be
no money to split,

681
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:36,155
unless we can get that woman
in here to open the vault.

682
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:43,922
It sounds insane. You really think
this could work? This...

683
00:57:43,923 --> 00:57:45,054
- Pressure inversion.
- Right.

684
00:57:45,078 --> 00:57:46,926
It's risky, but it's the
best chance we've got.

685
00:57:46,950 --> 00:57:48,166
Those are some slim odds.

686
00:57:48,190 --> 00:57:49,590
Make the call.

687
00:57:51,030 --> 00:57:54,110
Come in. This is Agent Corbin.
Do you read me? Over.

688
00:57:54,770 --> 00:57:57,526
Casey.
Nice of you to check in.

689
00:57:57,550 --> 00:57:59,966
<i>I didn't peg you for
a traitor, Connor.</i>

690
00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:01,331
Guess you can forget about that

691
00:58:01,350 --> 00:58:04,510
retirement in Ireland,
just a nice Super-max for you.

692
00:58:04,530 --> 00:58:06,126
I doubt that's why you called.

693
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:10,057
I'm tired of running, I'm ready
to make a deal, a trade.

694
00:58:10,058 --> 00:58:11,406
What kind of trade?

695
00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:15,046
You release all the hostages, and
I will come in and open the vault.

696
00:58:15,070 --> 00:58:16,966
You can have it all.

697
00:58:16,990 --> 00:58:19,257
That sounds too good to be true,

698
00:58:19,258 --> 00:58:21,185
coming from an
ambitious girl like you.

699
00:58:21,510 --> 00:58:25,129
I don't want anyone else to die.
Money or garbage, it's not mine.

700
00:58:25,310 --> 00:58:28,807
I will give you one hostage,
one for one.

701
00:58:28,831 --> 00:58:31,711
- No deal.
- Then people start to die.

702
00:58:32,070 --> 00:58:35,766
- Starting with your friend Moreno here.
- Two hostages.

703
00:58:35,790 --> 00:58:37,806
Release Moreno and the repair guy,

704
00:58:37,830 --> 00:58:42,408
and I will come in. After you get the
money, release all of the army guys.

705
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:46,606
- Do we have a deal?
- Deal. Where are you?

706
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:48,486
Get proof of life?

707
00:58:48,510 --> 00:58:52,186
Casey, where are you?

708
00:58:52,187 --> 00:58:55,811
Not so fast. First you have
to prove they're still alive.

709
00:58:55,835 --> 00:58:57,633
Gonna need to talk
to Breeze Rutledge.

710
00:58:57,634 --> 00:58:59,723
Get the repair guy out.

711
00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:03,563
And put Agent Moreno on.
Let me talk to him.

712
00:59:09,670 --> 00:59:12,246
It's me, Casey.

713
00:59:12,270 --> 00:59:14,126
Thank you.

714
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:17,190
No need to thank me, Randy,
we are on the same team.

715
00:59:19,150 --> 00:59:22,355
Will. Here.

716
00:59:23,350 --> 00:59:25,950
Someone wants to talk to you.

717
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:31,150
Breeze, red dog, Omaha, 22.

718
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:36,898
- Hey, kid.
- Breeze, you in one piece?

719
00:59:37,925 --> 00:59:40,268
I'm still breathing.

720
00:59:40,430 --> 00:59:41,990
I thought you left.

721
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:45,750
Nah, I got to missing you too much.

722
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:49,710
Good old Willie.

723
00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:53,924
Listen, brother,

724
00:59:53,925 --> 00:59:57,508
save yourself, man.
They're gonna kill me anyway.

725
01:00:00,990 --> 01:00:03,886
Just be cool.

726
01:00:03,910 --> 01:00:05,886
All right?

727
01:00:05,910 --> 01:00:09,269
Everything is going
to be OK. You'll see.

728
01:00:11,230 --> 01:00:13,126
I love you.

729
01:00:13,150 --> 01:00:17,886
I love you, too. In fact, everybody
loves everybody around here.

730
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:19,486
Now, where are you?

731
01:00:19,510 --> 01:00:22,310
- We are at the mall.
- Which mall?

732
01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:26,152
There is only one mall in Gulf port.

733
01:00:26,153 --> 01:00:28,566
Figure it out.

734
01:00:28,590 --> 01:00:31,030
Course there is.

735
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:36,830
Put this on.
It's a safety harness.

736
01:00:40,475 --> 01:00:43,986
I tried everything, there's no word.
He's just gone.

737
01:00:44,430 --> 01:00:47,790
You got to hand it to him,
he was right.

738
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:51,830
Tammy is going off the chart.

739
01:00:56,910 --> 01:00:59,166
I used to shop here with my daddy.

740
01:00:59,190 --> 01:01:02,166
We had a small Catalina,
16-and-a-half footer,

741
01:01:02,190 --> 01:01:05,270
used to take it out on the Gulf
in the summertime. It was fun.

742
01:01:09,590 --> 01:01:11,310
Now you're armed.

743
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:19,427
Come on!
Get in there.

744
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:31,350
Show yourselves.
We got the place surrounded.

745
01:01:34,470 --> 01:01:36,070
Come on out.

746
01:01:36,750 --> 01:01:39,350
Come out, wherever you are.

747
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:42,756
Move. OK, hold it.

748
01:01:42,757 --> 01:01:45,030
Show yourselves.

749
01:01:48,590 --> 01:01:50,726
That's far enough.

750
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:52,926
We don't want no trouble, man.

751
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:55,214
We're in for the
Treasury woman, right.

752
01:01:55,470 --> 01:01:59,363
This is the deal.
Now, where is she?

753
01:02:02,150 --> 01:02:04,845
She right here somewhere,
she just loves shopping.

754
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:08,345
Next joke will cost you, asshole.
The girl, or he dies.

755
01:02:09,830 --> 01:02:12,188
How you doing down there, Breeze?

756
01:02:12,189 --> 01:02:15,849
Well, I'm just waiting for my
quarterback to call the play.

757
01:02:15,873 --> 01:02:18,766
This play just a little flea flicker,
I might signal go long.

758
01:02:18,790 --> 01:02:21,116
Shut your yap up,
and send her out now.

759
01:02:21,117 --> 01:02:24,030
OK, OK. Casey.

760
01:02:26,130 --> 01:02:29,998
Where's Moreno?
Oh, he's safe and sound.

761
01:02:29,999 --> 01:02:32,950
You can trust us,
we're the police.

762
01:02:38,352 --> 01:02:39,898
Now.

763
01:03:30,350 --> 01:03:32,190
Look out.

764
01:04:13,310 --> 01:04:18,550
Breeze. Breeze, come out,
it's me and Casey.

765
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:24,830
Guess he figured this would be
the first place they'd look.

766
01:04:30,059 --> 01:04:35,270
Got you a gift.
It was my daddy's.

767
01:04:37,230 --> 01:04:39,953
Beauty. Browning.

768
01:04:41,090 --> 01:04:44,230
Well, eight rounds
is better than nothing.

769
01:04:49,138 --> 01:04:51,310
Thank you.

770
01:04:54,470 --> 01:04:56,686
How long do you think
we have before it passes?

771
01:04:56,710 --> 01:04:58,350
I mean, it's moving real quick.

772
01:04:58,990 --> 01:05:02,166
I think the eye of the storm is
going to be over us real soon.

773
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:03,907
It's confusing how in songs,
they always say

774
01:05:03,930 --> 01:05:07,585
into the eye of the storm,
and that's the calm part.

775
01:05:07,609 --> 01:05:09,332
Yeah, it can be the
most beautiful place,

776
01:05:09,350 --> 01:05:12,293
20-40 miles wide, like a
warm summer's day,

777
01:05:12,294 --> 01:05:16,166
but the eye wall, that's a different
story. That's the real killer.

778
01:05:16,190 --> 01:05:18,086
You know, it's the layer
around the ring,

779
01:05:18,110 --> 01:05:21,486
that's fueled by thunderstorms
on an atomic bomb level.

780
01:05:21,510 --> 01:05:24,101
I mean, you get trapped in that,
sure enough, it's death.

781
01:05:24,125 --> 01:05:26,221
Great.

782
01:05:28,430 --> 01:05:30,270
Ain't nothing in there but poison.

783
01:05:31,430 --> 01:05:36,246
I got what you want. What you want is
peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.

784
01:05:36,270 --> 01:05:38,550
Yes, really.

785
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:44,950
Cool.

786
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:49,150
Yes. Fricking love Monday,
you weirdo.

787
01:05:57,470 --> 01:05:59,086
Is this Jif?

788
01:05:59,110 --> 01:06:02,606
No, I'm a Skippy guy, so Skip.

789
01:06:02,630 --> 01:06:05,526
Really. It's Smucker's strawberry
though.

790
01:06:05,550 --> 01:06:07,470
Correctamundo.

791
01:06:11,030 --> 01:06:13,466
They're going to use the eye
to escape, aren't they?

792
01:06:13,490 --> 01:06:14,566
It's what I'd do.

793
01:06:14,590 --> 01:06:16,986
Roll-out in the middle,
let it dissipate,

794
01:06:17,010 --> 01:06:19,103
which it's going to do
when it gets inland.

795
01:06:20,790 --> 01:06:23,046
We should take the fight to them.

796
01:06:23,070 --> 01:06:26,086
- How do you mean?
- Car bomb.

797
01:06:26,110 --> 01:06:30,126
We detonate it at a safe
distance, but car bomb.

798
01:06:30,150 --> 01:06:32,126
We just need ammonia,
fertilizer, diesel,

799
01:06:32,150 --> 01:06:34,326
things we can get at a
garden supply store.

800
01:06:34,350 --> 01:06:35,926
How the hell do you know that?

801
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:38,206
When you are a Fed they
teach you this shit.

802
01:06:38,230 --> 01:06:42,766
Timothy McVeigh took
out the Federal Building with that.

803
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:44,446
You just load up a car,

804
01:06:44,470 --> 01:06:48,086
plant it at the gate, when
they convoy out, blow it.

805
01:06:48,110 --> 01:06:51,446
OK, so we are going to need a car.

806
01:06:51,470 --> 01:06:55,686
One that's not on its roof.

807
01:06:55,710 --> 01:07:00,686
Would need to be watertight,
have a decent electrical system.

808
01:07:00,710 --> 01:07:03,190
Yeah, where we going to find
a car like that?

809
01:07:08,833 --> 01:07:10,464
The Dominator?

810
01:07:10,590 --> 01:07:14,755
No. No. Are you kidding?
This is a federal vehicle.

811
01:07:15,190 --> 01:07:18,978
Federal property?
So is the $600 million,

812
01:07:18,979 --> 01:07:22,070
they would buy you a fleet
of these things for that, Will.

813
01:07:24,910 --> 01:07:26,406
No.

814
01:07:26,430 --> 01:07:28,790
I need your help.

815
01:07:34,830 --> 01:07:37,350
Found it.

816
01:07:37,970 --> 01:07:40,785
She's got enough gas to get
more bang for your buck.

817
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:49,646
They must have seen The Dominator.

818
01:07:49,670 --> 01:07:52,870
I'll look for a way out the back.

819
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:09,110
No shit today, Casey.
I know you're in here.

820
01:08:10,790 --> 01:08:13,046
There's four of us,
all with automatics,

821
01:08:13,070 --> 01:08:14,446
against whatever you got.

822
01:08:14,470 --> 01:08:16,606
You need me, I'm the only
one with the code.

823
01:08:16,630 --> 01:08:18,230
The protection is only for you.

824
01:08:19,150 --> 01:08:22,086
It doesn't apply to your boyfriend.

825
01:08:22,110 --> 01:08:23,766
I'll tell you what.

826
01:08:23,790 --> 01:08:26,606
You let him drive away unharmed,

827
01:08:26,630 --> 01:08:30,526
and I will come in and open
the safe. No, no, no.

828
01:08:30,550 --> 01:08:33,430
Call him out.

829
01:08:36,710 --> 01:08:38,950
Call him out!

830
01:08:42,030 --> 01:08:44,430
Go!

831
01:10:23,510 --> 01:10:26,710
Somebody here. Help!

832
01:10:56,782 --> 01:10:58,870
Will.

833
01:10:59,990 --> 01:11:03,726
Willie. Will.

834
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:06,190
Hey, Will.

835
01:11:08,070 --> 01:11:12,006
Here. Come here, buddy.

836
01:11:12,030 --> 01:11:15,646
Get on. Come on.

837
01:11:15,670 --> 01:11:19,526
- I got you. I got you.
- I lost Casey.

838
01:11:19,550 --> 01:11:23,126
- I saw her, they got her.
- First things first, buddy.

839
01:11:23,150 --> 01:11:25,750
First things first.

840
01:11:40,110 --> 01:11:43,046
Moreno. You're alive.

841
01:11:43,070 --> 01:11:45,726
No, no, no, no, the money.

842
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:49,406
We had a deal. You let
him go, and I'll open it.

843
01:11:49,430 --> 01:11:53,726
You are in a piss poor position
to negotiate, lady.

844
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:55,750
No.

845
01:11:56,590 --> 01:11:59,910
Frears, turn the shredder on.

846
01:12:06,390 --> 01:12:09,146
What? Are you going to shred me?

847
01:12:09,170 --> 01:12:12,221
Oh, not you. Him.

848
01:12:12,470 --> 01:12:14,910
No, no. Hey!

849
01:12:16,870 --> 01:12:18,830
- Wait, you win.
- Stop.

850
01:12:23,510 --> 01:12:25,870
You win.

851
01:12:26,510 --> 01:12:28,110
You win.

852
01:12:39,110 --> 01:12:41,670
It was here all the time.

853
01:13:15,150 --> 01:13:18,270
Boy, come to papa.

854
01:13:26,030 --> 01:13:30,190
A priest once said to me, 'Money
won't get you to heaven, Connor.'

855
01:13:31,430 --> 01:13:34,750
Clearly he never saw this.

856
01:13:39,550 --> 01:13:41,630
Randy.

857
01:13:45,270 --> 01:13:49,630
That is what you get for
causing us so much trouble.

858
01:13:50,350 --> 01:13:53,470
That is for Zander,
that is for Jackie.

859
01:13:55,630 --> 01:13:58,486
I will kill you for this.

860
01:13:58,510 --> 01:14:03,246
Everybody else has tried.
Why not you?

861
01:14:03,270 --> 01:14:06,482
Let's load up. Bring her.

862
01:14:06,483 --> 01:14:08,750
I'm not done with her just yet.

863
01:14:28,150 --> 01:14:31,846
Put that around you, Willie.

864
01:14:31,870 --> 01:14:33,246
All right, let's suit up, man.

865
01:14:33,270 --> 01:14:36,310
This your vitamins.

866
01:14:37,070 --> 01:14:39,246
Something warm.

867
01:14:39,270 --> 01:14:43,030
- Definitely need some of this.
- What in the hell?

868
01:14:43,910 --> 01:14:47,446
Well, I am a citizen of Alabama.

869
01:14:47,470 --> 01:14:49,326
Here, man.

870
01:14:49,350 --> 01:14:51,686
Come on, Willie, take your pick.

871
01:14:51,710 --> 01:14:54,550
No, I'd only wind up
shooting you or me.

872
01:14:58,030 --> 01:15:01,059
That's the eye of the storm.
About 40 miles wide,

873
01:15:01,070 --> 01:15:03,971
it could be like a bright,
sunny day in the middle of hell.

874
01:15:05,470 --> 01:15:08,676
Well, dude, it's time for the
Rutledge boys to go to work.

875
01:15:12,830 --> 01:15:15,127
They sure as shit got the money.

876
01:15:16,230 --> 01:15:19,404
And they sure as shit got her, too.

877
01:15:19,470 --> 01:15:21,799
Let me ask you a question, Willie,

878
01:15:22,030 --> 01:15:26,337
we could just let the whole pack
of them go, money and all.

879
01:15:26,338 --> 01:15:28,837
What do they teach you in the army?
Leave no man behind.

880
01:15:28,861 --> 01:15:31,166
- Did you forget that?
- I was just testing.

881
01:15:31,190 --> 01:15:34,726
Nice to see you grow a
pair since this morning.

882
01:15:34,750 --> 01:15:35,866
Let's take the shortcut.

883
01:15:35,890 --> 01:15:38,310
Pick them up at
Shelley's farm, right?

884
01:15:51,870 --> 01:15:54,270
I need to tell you something.

885
01:15:55,310 --> 01:15:58,966
No, you don't.
Everything's fine.

886
01:15:58,990 --> 01:16:00,926
Just leave it.

887
01:16:00,950 --> 01:16:05,390
No, I want to apologise for
some of the things I said.

888
01:16:06,870 --> 01:16:08,926
Well, we all say
things we don't mean.

889
01:16:08,950 --> 01:16:10,646
Forget it.

890
01:16:10,670 --> 01:16:12,246
I can't.

891
01:16:12,270 --> 01:16:14,406
Look, I know you know
I was just a little kid,

892
01:16:14,430 --> 01:16:19,486
but I said some stuff,
to try and hurt you.

893
01:16:19,510 --> 01:16:22,766
I get it. I get it.

894
01:16:22,790 --> 01:16:25,390
And I'm well and truly sorry.

895
01:16:28,030 --> 01:16:33,046
Well, shit, I'm sorry, too.

896
01:16:33,070 --> 01:16:37,566
I haven't been the best older
brother I could have been either.

897
01:16:37,590 --> 01:16:39,710
Lord knows I've tried, man.

898
01:16:41,870 --> 01:16:43,990
Just not hard enough.

899
01:16:47,950 --> 01:16:50,906
All right, now that we've
put all that shit out there,

900
01:16:50,930 --> 01:16:54,246
- you've got to promise me something.
- Name it.

901
01:16:54,270 --> 01:16:58,046
I gave you this once, once, Willie,

902
01:16:58,070 --> 01:17:00,286
but you've got to promise me
this is the last time

903
01:17:00,310 --> 01:17:05,110
we ever share our deep,
personal feelings again.

904
01:17:07,470 --> 01:17:11,030
Hell, yes, sir, you've
got yourself a deal.

905
01:17:45,230 --> 01:17:48,646
Jesus, Perkins, speed up. That thing
wants to swallow us whole.

906
01:17:48,670 --> 01:17:51,470
Now you know why I put you last.

907
01:17:53,030 --> 01:17:54,790
Dick.

908
01:18:05,150 --> 01:18:07,806
You can't drive this thing for shit.

909
01:18:07,830 --> 01:18:09,466
You want to try?

910
01:18:09,490 --> 01:18:12,126
It ain't easy. My brother-in-law
drove one long haul,

911
01:18:12,150 --> 01:18:14,566
and he was an angry son of a gun.

912
01:18:14,590 --> 01:18:15,806
Now I know why.

913
01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:17,886
Just keep it on the road.

914
01:18:17,910 --> 01:18:21,046
And you, nobody asked
to hear from you.

915
01:18:21,070 --> 01:18:23,190
Keep it zipped, hear me?

916
01:18:32,670 --> 01:18:35,510
You are so... So,

917
01:18:44,710 --> 01:18:47,535
- All right. You ready?
- No.

918
01:18:47,990 --> 01:18:49,727
Get your ass out of here.

919
01:19:09,630 --> 01:19:11,550
Send it, Willie.

920
01:19:25,710 --> 01:19:29,486
Whoa, come on, come on.

921
01:19:29,510 --> 01:19:31,246
Jump. It's too far.

922
01:19:31,270 --> 01:19:32,900
Come on, jump.

923
01:19:34,510 --> 01:19:36,790
Grab my leg.

924
01:19:46,110 --> 01:19:48,230
Grab my hand.

925
01:20:05,590 --> 01:20:07,446
That wasn't too far.

926
01:20:07,470 --> 01:20:08,790
We did it.

927
01:20:09,710 --> 01:20:13,086
We're on the top of a truck,
we haven't done shit.

928
01:20:13,110 --> 01:20:15,286
Hey, one thing I learned
in the war, man,

929
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:18,366
you got to take your victories
where you find them.

930
01:20:18,390 --> 01:20:19,870
Let's do this.

931
01:20:35,950 --> 01:20:37,750
Oh, my God!

932
01:20:42,710 --> 01:20:44,966
Hey!

933
01:20:44,990 --> 01:20:46,326
Oh, my God, you shot him!

934
01:20:46,350 --> 01:20:49,270
Shut up! Get in the back,
before you get one in the head.

935
01:20:52,350 --> 01:20:55,206
I'm going to kill you.

936
01:20:55,230 --> 01:20:57,286
Don't even think about it,
sweet cheeks.

937
01:20:57,310 --> 01:20:58,830
Ready? Oh, yeah.

938
01:20:59,470 --> 01:21:00,726
Here goes nothing.

939
01:21:00,750 --> 01:21:02,710
Well, you'd better hope not.

940
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:07,070
It's OK.

941
01:21:17,790 --> 01:21:19,126
Yeah.

942
01:21:19,150 --> 01:21:21,070
It's OK, baby.

943
01:21:34,430 --> 01:21:36,430
You killed my brother.

944
01:21:37,390 --> 01:21:39,926
I'm going to kill you,
no matter what Perkins says.

945
01:21:39,950 --> 01:21:41,506
And I'm gonna make it hurt.

946
01:21:41,530 --> 01:21:44,265
I know I'm not the first one
to tell you this, Rice...

947
01:21:44,470 --> 01:21:48,310
you got anger issues with women.

948
01:21:54,230 --> 01:21:56,550
See what I mean.

949
01:21:58,070 --> 01:21:59,446
Get her off of me!

950
01:21:59,470 --> 01:22:01,670
I can't keep it straight.

951
01:22:02,590 --> 01:22:04,070
Get off of me.

952
01:22:12,270 --> 01:22:14,310
You got to get off.

953
01:22:18,470 --> 01:22:20,870
I can't have it straight.

954
01:22:24,830 --> 01:22:27,750
My God.

955
01:22:32,430 --> 01:22:35,190
God dammit, lady, don't make me.

956
01:22:48,470 --> 01:22:50,670
I'm in, Casey.

957
01:22:54,950 --> 01:22:57,950
Oh, shit.

958
01:23:20,270 --> 01:23:22,310
Get ready, Casey.

959
01:23:40,490 --> 01:23:44,766
Take a look outside, tell me
how far back the eye wall is.

960
01:23:44,790 --> 01:23:47,310
Half a mile, at most.

961
01:23:50,750 --> 01:23:55,150
Damn you to hell.

962
01:23:57,830 --> 01:24:00,126
OK, get down low, lovers.

963
01:24:00,150 --> 01:24:01,830
It's gonna get hot.

964
01:24:06,310 --> 01:24:09,350
- Breeze is in trouble.
- Let's go give him some help.

965
01:24:27,210 --> 01:24:28,430
Son of a...

966
01:24:51,470 --> 01:24:55,246
- You see what's behind us?
- Yeah, it's nothing good.

967
01:24:55,270 --> 01:24:57,646
Red dog, Omaha, 22.

968
01:24:57,670 --> 01:25:02,590
- What?
- Red dog, Omaha, 22, hut-hut.

969
01:25:03,790 --> 01:25:06,150
You got it.

970
01:25:15,070 --> 01:25:18,926
Get ready.

971
01:25:18,950 --> 01:25:20,990
Ah, you...

972
01:25:29,910 --> 01:25:33,990
Red dog, Omaha, 22, hut-hut.

973
01:25:38,950 --> 01:25:40,990
One more.

974
01:25:50,150 --> 01:25:52,670
That's the Alabama Slam, baby.

975
01:26:18,150 --> 01:26:21,030
Oh, no.

976
01:26:22,790 --> 01:26:24,646
No, no.

977
01:26:24,670 --> 01:26:26,186
You're blocking the runner,

978
01:26:26,210 --> 01:26:28,686
but forcing him backwards
at the eye wall?

979
01:26:28,710 --> 01:26:30,966
He must have figured it out by now,
but I sure wish

980
01:26:30,990 --> 01:26:33,030
I could have seen
his face when he did.

981
01:26:43,910 --> 01:26:46,230
What? No, no, no, no!

982
01:26:48,270 --> 01:26:50,030
No!

983
01:26:52,190 --> 01:26:55,046
My money! Damn you!

984
01:26:55,070 --> 01:26:57,310
Damn you!

985
01:26:59,790 --> 01:27:01,230
Damn you!

986
01:27:08,510 --> 01:27:12,030
We are not going to make it.
We're not gonna make it.

987
01:27:16,950 --> 01:27:18,990
I'm gonna drop back.

988
01:27:27,670 --> 01:27:29,846
Give me your hand.

989
01:27:29,870 --> 01:27:31,806
All right, we're going
to transfer over.

990
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:33,710
Come here. I want
you to take the wheel.

991
01:27:36,270 --> 01:27:39,966
Now put your foot on the gas,
right there. Can we get closer?

992
01:27:39,990 --> 01:27:42,886
You're going to come
over next, OK.

993
01:27:42,910 --> 01:27:44,446
Come on, Breeze.

994
01:27:44,470 --> 01:27:48,206
Get me closer.

995
01:27:48,230 --> 01:27:49,521
Let's go.

996
01:27:49,710 --> 01:27:52,126
- Stay!
- Come on.

997
01:27:52,150 --> 01:27:54,790
Now.

998
01:28:14,030 --> 01:28:17,310
- Now punch it, Willie.
- I'm going.

999
01:28:41,590 --> 01:28:44,686
Well, Breeze, you were right.

1000
01:28:44,710 --> 01:28:46,086
Come again.

1001
01:28:46,110 --> 01:28:49,898
Take your victories where you
can get them. That was a mouthful.

1002
01:28:49,899 --> 01:28:51,846
Yes, sir.

1003
01:28:51,870 --> 01:28:54,486
We earned 200 million,
that's some kind of victory.

1004
01:28:54,510 --> 01:28:57,726
And our lives.
That's some kind of victory.

1005
01:28:57,750 --> 01:28:59,830
Yeah. Yeah.

1006
01:29:02,430 --> 01:29:06,366
Listen, I've got you two partners,

1007
01:29:06,390 --> 01:29:08,630
200 million in cash,
no-one knows shit.

1008
01:29:09,510 --> 01:29:12,510
What do you say we turn this
truck around, head to Mexico?

1009
01:29:13,550 --> 01:29:15,606
Mexico.

1010
01:29:15,630 --> 01:29:17,926
Hell, I like the sound of that.

1011
01:29:17,950 --> 01:29:20,830
Yeah, we could get into
a shit load of...

1012
01:29:20,850 --> 01:29:23,550
Dangerous.

1013
01:29:24,990 --> 01:29:26,326
But, you know...

1014
01:29:26,350 --> 01:29:30,566
I was messing with you,
you degenerates.

1015
01:29:30,590 --> 01:29:32,630
Oh, mercy.

1016
01:29:35,350 --> 01:29:37,430
Red sky at night.

1017
01:29:45,710 --> 01:29:48,566
They teach you that in PhD school?

1018
01:29:48,590 --> 01:29:50,670
Yes, ma'am.
