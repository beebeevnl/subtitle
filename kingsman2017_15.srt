GINGER: We developed
our alpha gel technology

3
0:0:10.447 --> 0:0:11.648
for our own agents...

4
0:0:11.682 --> 0:0:13.450
in the event of a head shot.

5
0:0:13.483 --> 0:0:14.919
The gel protects the brain.

6
0:0:14.952 --> 0:0:17.555
Then, in the lab,
we use nanites...

7
0:0:17.588 --> 0:0:20.291
micro-bots,
to repair tissue damage.

8
0:0:26.831 --> 0:0:28.432
There are side effects.

0:0:28.465 --> 0:0:29.666
Partial amnesia...

10
0:0:29.700 --> 0:0:31.702
regression to the younger self.

11
0:0:31.735 --> 0:0:35.706
With no idea who he was,
there was nothing we could do.

12
0:0:36.640 --> 0:0:39.108
But now you guys are here...

13
0:0:39.142 --> 0:0:41.144
there's a good chance
we can bring him back.

POPPY: You're late.

15
0:1:10.575 --> 0:1:12.209
Why are you still wearing that?

16
0:1:12.242 --> 0:1:15.845
Until you get rid of
the perimeter landmines...

17
0:1:15.880 --> 0:1:18.282
I'll keep wearing the suit,
thank you very much.

POPPY: Scaredy-cat.

19
0:1:19.450 --> 0:1:20.751
Shut up and sit down.

Let's go!

Hey, hey, Elton, language.

0:1:36.767 --> 0:1:40.004
Okay, as fabulous
as your catalogue is...

26
0:1:40.037 --> 0:1:42.573
I think I want to hear
some Gershwin.

I still can't believe...

30
0:1:46.043 --> 0:1:48.546
you got away with
kidnapping Elton John.

31
0:1:48.579 --> 0:1:51.414
I know! But with Valentine
abducting those celebrities...

32
0:1:51.447 --> 0:1:54.351
it seemed silly not to take
advantage of the confusion.

33
0:1:55.952 --> 0:1:58.355
Shit. Has Elton
got the blue rash?

34

Lights.

Hey, Elton.

37
0:2:6.563 --> 0:2:8.564
Have you been a bad boy again?

38
0:2:8.597 --> 0:2:9.633
Mmm-mmm.

39
0:2:9.666 --> 0:2:12.135
You're lying.
Look at your hands.

40
0:2:15.738 --> 0:2:17.006
What is it?

41
0:2:17.039 --> 0:2:19.976
It's proof that my plan
is gonna work.

42
0:2:20.010 --> 0:2:24.247
It's also the first sign
of a slow and horrible death.

Huh, not very angelic.
