1
00:00:26,441 --> 00:00:29,031
May 17th, 2009.

2
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,555
Further research on Himiko.

3
00:00:32,487 --> 00:00:33,549
According to legend.

4
00:00:33,573 --> 00:00:35,851
Himiko, the first queen of Japan

5
00:00:36,932 --> 00:00:41,077
was a powerful sorceress who ruled her
empire through dark magic.

6
00:00:42,213 --> 00:00:44,143
Spreading death and destruction,

7
00:00:44,167 --> 00:00:46,257
by the mere touch of her hand.

8
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:50,295
She was only stopped by
a single twist of fate.

9
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:53,299
An army of her own
Generals bound...

10
00:00:53,323 --> 00:00:54,510
and dragged Himiko...

11
00:00:54,534 --> 00:00:56,410
to an uninhabitable island

12
00:00:56,434 --> 00:00:58,468
in the middle of the treacherous

13
00:00:58,469 --> 00:00:59,669
Devil's Sea.

14
00:01:00,223 --> 00:01:04,939
There she remains entombed
beneath the mountains.

15
00:01:05,697 --> 00:01:09,523
I found a spec, on an
old map that no one else has.

16
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,382
And she's there.

17
00:01:12,247 --> 00:01:13,976
Waiting to be unleashed.

18
00:01:16,128 --> 00:01:18,109
I have to get there first.

19
00:01:19,524 --> 00:01:20,558
Even if it means doing...

20
00:01:20,582 --> 00:01:22,945
the last thing
I'd ever want to do...

21
00:01:23,878 --> 00:01:26,296
Leaving my Lara behind.

22
00:01:29,021 --> 00:01:30,452
You gotta make decisions, Lara.

23
00:01:30,476 --> 00:01:32,455
You gotta make something to happen.

24
00:01:37,528 --> 00:01:40,356
Counter punching doesn't work for you,
you don't have the skill.

25
00:01:40,357 --> 00:01:43,151
- Thanks, Terry.
- You're welcome.

26
00:01:45,274 --> 00:01:47,363
Come on, Lara!

27
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:52,966
Stop dancing, start fighting!

28
00:01:53,951 --> 00:01:55,604
Yes girl!

29
00:01:58,268 --> 00:01:59,846
Come on!

30
00:02:07,195 --> 00:02:10,106
Nice one, Lara!
You've got this.

31
00:02:14,931 --> 00:02:16,600
- It's over.
- Isn't.

32
00:02:16,667 --> 00:02:18,549
Then get out of it.

33
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,231
Come on, Lara, tap out!

34
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:50,262
- Don't say it.
- You got whoops girl, you got whooped.

35
00:02:50,286 --> 00:02:53,014
- Not whooped.
- Okay, not whooped.

36
00:02:53,749 --> 00:02:54,949
Marmalized.

37
00:02:56,418 --> 00:02:57,681
Marmalized?

38
00:02:58,306 --> 00:03:00,408
She is not a freaking super hero.

39
00:03:00,927 --> 00:03:03,408
The truth is, I let her.

40
00:03:03,604 --> 00:03:04,853
We cool?

41
00:03:06,134 --> 00:03:07,334
Yup, cool.

42
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:11,944
It was fun, actually.

43
00:03:12,219 --> 00:03:13,419
Thanks!

44
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:20,341
I'll get you next time.

45
00:03:20,365 --> 00:03:22,282
I'll marmalize you.

46
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,033
You're home early tonight, right?

47
00:03:26,057 --> 00:03:27,257
Yeah.

48
00:03:27,682 --> 00:03:28,882
Catch you later.

49
00:03:29,234 --> 00:03:30,515
Laters.

50
00:03:31,021 --> 00:03:32,507
Who stole my apple?

51
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:37,102
Should've known it was you.

52
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,422
Why I wanna do a thing like that?

53
00:03:40,461 --> 00:03:41,969
Cause you can't afford your own.

54
00:03:42,293 --> 00:03:44,173
Just seen you're behind
with your payments.

55
00:03:44,348 --> 00:03:47,281
Terry, look, I'll catch up on the payment.
I promise.

56
00:03:47,348 --> 00:03:48,719
I'll make it up to you.

57
00:03:50,082 --> 00:03:52,304
Get a job, Lara.

58
00:03:53,222 --> 00:03:55,305
Do you think I'm dressed
like this for fun?

59
00:03:56,081 --> 00:03:58,852
I like you, Lara.
I really do, but...

60
00:03:59,126 --> 00:04:01,482
NO PLAY NO PLAY.

61
00:04:35,683 --> 00:04:37,602
Good Morning Lara...

62
00:04:38,292 --> 00:04:38,715
Hey.

63
00:04:38,739 --> 00:04:41,546
- Hi, all good?
- Yeah, having a great day.

64
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:42,770
You?

65
00:04:44,377 --> 00:04:46,195
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

66
00:04:46,196 --> 00:04:49,236
Go to the action.
Invite her to dinner.

67
00:04:50,116 --> 00:04:51,332
Come on!

68
00:04:51,601 --> 00:04:52,801
Anything else?

69
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:55,574
No, no, no.

70
00:04:57,171 --> 00:05:00,004
- Good bye!
- Good bye!

71
00:05:01,011 --> 00:05:02,022
What?

72
00:05:02,023 --> 00:05:04,675
Why didn't you asked her?
You're stupid.

73
00:05:14,621 --> 00:05:16,136
You got that fox hunt sorted right?

74
00:05:16,137 --> 00:05:17,524
Yeah, more or less.

75
00:05:17,542 --> 00:05:20,586
Got 30 hounds signed up.
Just gotta find the fox now.

76
00:05:21,056 --> 00:05:21,967
Good luck on that.

77
00:05:21,991 --> 00:05:23,590
Need someone quick enough to,
make it interesting?

78
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:25,162
Yeah, I know, find a thing quick.

79
00:05:25,186 --> 00:05:27,814
But dumb enough to think they can win.

80
00:05:28,059 --> 00:05:29,516
What are you plotting?

81
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,461
We are gonna do a fox hunt.

82
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,235
A what?

83
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:35,944
It's like a race. Except the fox
gets a head start.

84
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:38,770
- Leaving a paint trail behind his bike.
- For the baying hounds to follow.

85
00:05:38,794 --> 00:05:41,177
And if they haven't caught by
the time the paint runs out...

86
00:05:41,201 --> 00:05:42,649
he wins all the money.

87
00:05:44,164 --> 00:05:46,774
- How much money?
- 600 quid.

88
00:05:48,143 --> 00:05:50,870
I think you've just found yourself a fox.

89
00:05:54,798 --> 00:05:55,945
Are you being serious?

90
00:05:55,969 --> 00:05:57,603
Not quick or dumb enough for you?

91
00:05:57,627 --> 00:05:59,411
No, I mean, I just...

92
00:06:01,808 --> 00:06:04,680
- You're on.
- Hide fox and all after.

93
00:06:04,988 --> 00:06:06,555
Ooh, Shakespeare?

94
00:06:07,042 --> 00:06:08,242
Hamlet, is it?

95
00:06:08,256 --> 00:06:10,619
Dunno, things just stick in my brain.

96
00:06:10,672 --> 00:06:13,657
You know it's Hamlet.
And I ask you once again...

97
00:06:13,681 --> 00:06:15,510
Why on earth are you bike runner?

98
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,473
You, Bruce.

99
00:06:18,904 --> 00:06:20,480
I wanna be close to you.

100
00:06:28,695 --> 00:06:30,310
Hi.

101
00:06:49,526 --> 00:06:55,244
5, 4, 3, 2, 1... Go!

102
00:07:03,648 --> 00:07:05,910
Hey!

103
00:07:26,432 --> 00:07:28,160
- Careful!
- Excuse me!

104
00:07:54,295 --> 00:07:57,762
- Dammit!
- Come on! Go, go, go.

105
00:07:59,143 --> 00:08:01,061
Where did she go?

106
00:08:44,235 --> 00:08:46,163
I won't be long.

107
00:08:58,164 --> 00:09:01,270
- Oi! Watch where you're going!
- Use your mirrors!

108
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:11,568
Go, go!

109
00:09:19,942 --> 00:09:22,329
Fancy seeing you here.

110
00:09:23,248 --> 00:09:24,448
Ana.

111
00:09:24,794 --> 00:09:26,252
You didn't have to come,

112
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:28,010
I don't need a guardian anymore.

113
00:09:28,413 --> 00:09:29,613
Really?

114
00:09:30,941 --> 00:09:33,174
You've been decorating?

115
00:09:37,195 --> 00:09:38,966
Haven't seen you for a long time.

116
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:40,758
You've never seen me.

117
00:09:44,798 --> 00:09:45,998
I'm sorry.

118
00:09:48,051 --> 00:09:49,251
Thanks for coming.

119
00:09:49,938 --> 00:09:51,193
What was today about?

120
00:09:53,001 --> 00:09:54,156
I needed the money.

121
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,982
No, you don't!

122
00:09:56,212 --> 00:09:57,389
There's an inheritance waiting for you.

123
00:09:57,413 --> 00:09:59,154
- If any you'd...
- I won't!

124
00:10:02,181 --> 00:10:03,808
It's been seven years, Lara.

125
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,252
Tokyo Police stopped
looking for your father...

126
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:11,436
five years ago.

127
00:10:12,134 --> 00:10:14,975
Private investigators won't even
take our money anymore.

128
00:10:16,556 --> 00:10:18,240
I know it's difficult to accept,

129
00:10:19,016 --> 00:10:21,381
but you really must come in
and sign these papers now.

130
00:10:21,728 --> 00:10:22,928
Hmm?

131
00:10:23,453 --> 00:10:27,115
- That's why you came?
- No, I came for you.

132
00:10:28,353 --> 00:10:30,482
Just think what you can do
for the world...

133
00:10:30,648 --> 00:10:32,498
with your potential,
with your wealth.

134
00:10:32,522 --> 00:10:34,521
His wealth, not mine.

135
00:10:37,926 --> 00:10:39,586
Listen, it's very simple.

136
00:10:40,394 --> 00:10:42,934
If you don't sign the
papers, then everything...

137
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:45,531
your father worked for
will be sold off.

138
00:10:46,534 --> 00:10:47,899
Not just the company.

139
00:10:49,632 --> 00:10:51,313
The Croft manor, also.

140
00:10:54,267 --> 00:10:57,333
Can you imagine how he would feel
if you lost the house.

141
00:11:02,303 --> 00:11:04,732
Lara, your father's gone.

142
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:08,882
But, you can pick up
where he left off.

143
00:11:10,241 --> 00:11:11,960
It's in your blood.

144
00:11:17,348 --> 00:11:18,548
I'm sorry.

145
00:11:20,202 --> 00:11:21,860
I'm just not that kind of Croft.

146
00:11:40,781 --> 00:11:42,738
I don't want you to go, daddy.

147
00:11:43,564 --> 00:11:44,863
I won't be long, my love.

148
00:11:46,996 --> 00:11:49,544
You must understand,
we Crofts, we have...

149
00:11:49,568 --> 00:11:52,832
responsibilities, jobs to do.

150
00:11:52,892 --> 00:11:57,237
- But I'll miss you.
- I know, I'll miss you too.

151
00:11:57,353 --> 00:11:59,138
But I may have a
solution to that.

152
00:12:00,351 --> 00:12:01,551
See this?

153
00:12:01,758 --> 00:12:04,848
This was your mother's.
It has special powers.

154
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:06,268
What do you mean?

155
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:08,094
Have you wanna feel
close to someone,

156
00:12:08,192 --> 00:12:11,023
just put it in your hand
and you hold it tightly.

157
00:12:11,145 --> 00:12:14,203
And you think of that person
and they will know.

158
00:12:14,373 --> 00:12:16,140
- Really?
- Yeah.

159
00:12:16,988 --> 00:12:18,188
It's magic.

160
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:20,567
And it means that we'll always be together,

161
00:12:20,591 --> 00:12:21,791
where ever I am.

162
00:12:23,225 --> 00:12:24,425
Okay?

163
00:12:31,807 --> 00:12:33,567
I'll be back, before
you know I've gone.

164
00:13:00,473 --> 00:13:02,393
C/H
CROFT HOLDINGS.

165
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,330
Oi!

166
00:13:04,986 --> 00:13:06,478
Courier's 'round the back.

167
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:08,040
I'm not a courier.

168
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:10,480
Well, I am.

169
00:13:10,504 --> 00:13:12,696
Right, so 'round the back.

170
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:22,029
I am here see Ana Miller.

171
00:13:22,745 --> 00:13:25,334
Well, you gotta sign in
like everyone else.

172
00:13:25,435 --> 00:13:27,154
- What's your name?
- Lara.

173
00:13:28,528 --> 00:13:30,107
- Lara...
- Croft.

174
00:13:35,293 --> 00:13:37,800
The pages that require
the signature...

175
00:13:37,979 --> 00:13:40,558
are marked for your convenience.

176
00:13:40,693 --> 00:13:42,347
DECLARATION OF DEATH IN ABSENTIA
Lord Richard Croft.

177
00:13:42,371 --> 00:13:44,971
Would you like Mr. Yaffe
to take you through the particulars?

178
00:13:45,733 --> 00:13:47,315
I gather I sign...

179
00:13:47,841 --> 00:13:50,940
and... dad is dead.

180
00:13:51,178 --> 00:13:54,300
I can imagine how...
how difficult this is for you.

181
00:13:57,214 --> 00:13:58,500
I miss him too.

182
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:16,097
That was dad's?

183
00:14:16,491 --> 00:14:20,151
Yes, Miss Croft, according
to Richard's will...

184
00:14:20,347 --> 00:14:23,761
In the event of his death,
I was to give it to you.

185
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,430
Karakuri.

186
00:14:26,553 --> 00:14:28,026
Japanese puzzle.

187
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,544
And technically speaking,

188
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:33,056
you are meant to
sign the papers first.

189
00:14:37,767 --> 00:14:40,841
I have never understand your father's
obsession with those things.

190
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:44,982
Wouldn't believe how many of
these were lying around the house.

191
00:14:45,374 --> 00:14:47,458
There was gonna be some purpose with...

192
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:23,193
The first letter from
my final destination.

193
00:15:24,031 --> 00:15:26,841
But he didn't leave a letter.

194
00:15:29,324 --> 00:15:32,290
THE FIRST LETTER FROM
MY FINAL DESTINATION.

195
00:15:34,345 --> 00:15:36,732
- If you'll excuse me.
- Lara...

196
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,545
IN THE MEMORY OF LORD RICHARD CROFT
1963-

197
00:16:25,722 --> 00:16:27,170
My final destination.

198
00:16:35,789 --> 00:16:38,347
The first letter.

199
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:40,341
What the...

200
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:01,562
ALEXANDER IVANOV.

201
00:18:01,586 --> 00:18:05,306
- JAMES FENG, STEWART JOHNSON.
- Dad...

202
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:06,989
What were you up to?

203
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:18,388
PLAY ME.

204
00:18:20,444 --> 00:18:21,644
Hello sprout.

205
00:18:22,506 --> 00:18:25,057
I knew I could trust you
to solve my puzzle.

206
00:18:25,139 --> 00:18:28,776
Unfortunately, if you are
watching this tape then...

207
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,940
It means that I must be dead.

208
00:18:32,358 --> 00:18:33,811
It will be obvious to you by now...

209
00:18:33,835 --> 00:18:35,518
that there was more
to my life than just...

210
00:18:35,542 --> 00:18:37,409
board rooms and business deals.

211
00:18:37,961 --> 00:18:40,487
Things that I could not
tell you about before.

212
00:18:41,381 --> 00:18:45,175
When your mother died,
grief nearly destroyed me.

213
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:48,869
I began searching the
world desperate for a...

214
00:18:49,073 --> 00:18:50,876
the hint of another realm.

215
00:18:51,753 --> 00:18:54,454
The proof that the supernatural is real.

216
00:18:55,804 --> 00:18:57,004
Anything...

217
00:18:57,175 --> 00:18:58,837
to feel her with me again.

218
00:19:00,137 --> 00:19:02,314
I made caught a
hobby of it, sprout.

219
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:05,142
Now...

220
00:19:05,591 --> 00:19:07,337
I need you to do me a favor.

221
00:19:07,864 --> 00:19:12,095
I need you to burn all my
research on the Himiko project.

222
00:19:12,209 --> 00:19:14,861
Just burn all of it,
the notebooks, the tapes, everything.

223
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,857
It's very important. If it falls
into the wrong hands, then...

224
00:19:17,881 --> 00:19:21,220
it could be catastrophic.
So please, do it straight away.

225
00:19:22,514 --> 00:19:24,869
I know you hate
being told what to do,

226
00:19:24,893 --> 00:19:27,572
but, please promise me that.

227
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,650
I hope you never have
to see this tape,

228
00:19:31,995 --> 00:19:33,195
but if you do...

229
00:19:34,572 --> 00:19:36,384
You found my secret calling.

230
00:19:39,351 --> 00:19:40,767
I hope you find yours.

231
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,270
Dad loves you.

232
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:14,565
HIMIKO

233
00:20:24,597 --> 00:20:25,797
October 5th.

234
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:29,101
They call Queen Himiko,
the mother of death.

235
00:20:29,331 --> 00:20:32,554
All the stories about her end in
rivers running red with blood.

236
00:20:33,088 --> 00:20:35,819
Bewitching people,
controlling minds.

237
00:20:36,338 --> 00:20:39,280
Spreading death and destruction
with just the touch of her hand.

238
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:42,478
The bloodshed only ended
when her own Generals...

239
00:20:42,537 --> 00:20:44,155
buried her alive in a tomb.

240
00:20:44,454 --> 00:20:49,022
Sealing her away from the outside world
on an Island no one could reach.

241
00:20:49,408 --> 00:20:51,710
History has erased its existence.

242
00:20:52,995 --> 00:20:55,054
The Lost Island of Yamatai.

243
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,280
I'm certain this is the place.

244
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,748
July 29th, 2011.

245
00:21:02,772 --> 00:21:05,874
I finally found the Captain
willing to take me to the Island.

246
00:21:06,768 --> 00:21:08,433
I must get there
first to ensure...

247
00:21:08,457 --> 00:21:11,491
her powers will never fall
into the wrong hands.

248
00:21:30,361 --> 00:21:32,657
That amulet was given
to my father...

249
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:35,397
by Emperor Showa of Japan.

250
00:21:36,052 --> 00:21:37,819
Right, right.
Well...

251
00:21:39,135 --> 00:21:42,014
- This ain't from Japan.
- You're correct.

252
00:21:42,252 --> 00:21:43,932
Emperor Showa was given
it by the grand son...

253
00:21:43,956 --> 00:21:45,893
of the former empire of Maratha.

254
00:21:45,917 --> 00:21:49,006
Maratha?
You had me laughing, isn't?

255
00:21:49,161 --> 00:21:51,305
And he himself got it from
Thibau, the last King of...

256
00:21:51,329 --> 00:21:54,257
Burma, when he was
exiled in India.

257
00:21:54,361 --> 00:21:56,106
Exiled in India?

258
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:57,733
What a fascinating tale.

259
00:21:57,862 --> 00:22:01,397
You got all these providence
down on paper, do you?

260
00:22:01,517 --> 00:22:03,299
If I have the providence on paper,

261
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:06,233
I would be at Christie's
with my, but um...

262
00:22:07,517 --> 00:22:09,231
This is your lucky day.

263
00:22:09,455 --> 00:22:10,533
- Is it?
- Yeah.

264
00:22:10,534 --> 00:22:13,258
Alan, what have I told you about
flirting with the customers?

265
00:22:13,259 --> 00:22:14,259
I'm not flirting.

266
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:17,595
I'm just naturally charismatic.
I was not flirting, I'm sorry.

267
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:20,236
I'm just a little...

268
00:22:20,269 --> 00:22:21,510
Have a look.

269
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,924
Big smiles, nice and casual.

270
00:22:32,123 --> 00:22:33,737
Right, well.
I'm pleased to say...

271
00:22:33,761 --> 00:22:35,984
we are in a position
to make you an offer.

272
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,723
Ten.

273
00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:43,629
Please.

274
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:46,379
Just a tad bit more?

275
00:22:46,403 --> 00:22:48,719
That's all I have to
remember my dad by.

276
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:50,673
Oh, your dad died.

277
00:22:51,984 --> 00:22:53,451
It's a shame, it's a

278
00:22:53,566 --> 00:22:56,020
terrible thing for a young
woman to lose her father.

279
00:22:56,044 --> 00:22:59,141
Really.
Alright fair enough, 9,000.

280
00:23:00,371 --> 00:23:01,571
You just said ten?

281
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:04,786
Well, people come in here, trying
that dead dad shit all the time.

282
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:05,989
You fall for it all the time.

283
00:23:06,013 --> 00:23:08,339
- Yes, you do.
- I fall for it twice.

284
00:23:08,363 --> 00:23:09,739
Yeah, twice...

285
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:10,955
It's the truth.

286
00:23:11,887 --> 00:23:13,704
Fine, I'm happy to
keep negotiating...

287
00:23:13,728 --> 00:23:15,572
because now the price is eight.

288
00:23:17,138 --> 00:23:19,136
OK, you win.

289
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,611
- Finally.
- Thank you. Really.

290
00:23:21,612 --> 00:23:23,498
- Thank you!
- Oi!

291
00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:26,393
For just such occasions!

292
00:23:29,262 --> 00:23:32,434
- For just such occasions.
- She burnt me taters.

293
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:35,284
- Seriously, sort it out!
- What? That is hot coffee.

294
00:23:35,764 --> 00:23:39,400
HONG KONG.

295
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:13,075
Excuse me, do you speak English?

296
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:15,230
No, no.

297
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:16,776
No?

298
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,415
Thank you.

299
00:24:19,642 --> 00:24:20,611
Sorry... Excuse me.

300
00:24:20,635 --> 00:24:24,560
- Yeah?
- Do you know Lu Ren? Lu Ren?

301
00:24:25,556 --> 00:24:27,611
Not even a tiny bit?

302
00:24:30,963 --> 00:24:33,455
- Do you speak English?
- Lady.

303
00:24:33,479 --> 00:24:35,362
You need help?

304
00:24:36,155 --> 00:24:39,119
Yes, I do.

305
00:24:39,143 --> 00:24:42,710
I'm looking for this
guy called Lu Ren.

306
00:24:42,734 --> 00:24:45,444
- Um, he's supposed to...
- Lu Ren's boat.

307
00:24:45,666 --> 00:24:48,163
- Yes.
- Endurance, over there.

308
00:24:48,197 --> 00:24:50,046
Endurance?
Which one?

309
00:24:51,868 --> 00:24:53,068
Oi!

310
00:24:54,466 --> 00:24:55,666
Wait!

311
00:25:51,902 --> 00:25:53,517
- Come on.
- Stay back!

312
00:25:58,032 --> 00:25:59,647
Give me the bag.

313
00:26:12,348 --> 00:26:14,196
You just lost your tip.

314
00:26:15,905 --> 00:26:17,344
You just lose your tongue!

315
00:26:44,981 --> 00:26:46,712
ENDURANCE.

316
00:26:56,943 --> 00:26:58,894
Lu! Lu Ren!

317
00:26:58,988 --> 00:27:00,188
Help!

318
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:18,919
Run! He's drunk again!

319
00:27:21,643 --> 00:27:22,843
Thank you.

320
00:27:27,656 --> 00:27:28,496
What?

321
00:27:28,664 --> 00:27:30,180
I said what are you
doing on my boat?

322
00:27:30,204 --> 00:27:34,523
I am not with them. I'm looking
for a man named Lu Ren.

323
00:27:34,547 --> 00:27:37,317
Congratulations, you found me.
Now get lost!

324
00:27:38,213 --> 00:27:41,107
Please. Wait.
Just listen. I mean...

325
00:27:41,131 --> 00:27:42,102
Okay, let's go.

326
00:27:42,126 --> 00:27:44,918
- I am not here to make any troubles.
- Keep walking!

327
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:47,684
Could you please put that
gun down and just...

328
00:27:51,749 --> 00:27:53,601
For God's sake!

329
00:27:55,661 --> 00:28:00,076
My father, Richard Croft, tried
to buy a boat from you.

330
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:02,900
No, not me. He didn't.

331
00:28:03,152 --> 00:28:04,352
Yes, he did.

332
00:28:06,015 --> 00:28:08,851
Your name is Lu Ren.

333
00:28:08,852 --> 00:28:10,671
This is from you.

334
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:14,715
Yes, I know my name, thanks.

335
00:28:15,597 --> 00:28:19,614
This is same as my fathers,
and he wrote that, not me.

336
00:28:22,004 --> 00:28:23,931
Well then I need to talk to him.

337
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:25,796
You and a hundred other people
he owed money...

338
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,095
Where is he?

339
00:28:27,174 --> 00:28:29,126
I don't know! OK?

340
00:28:29,153 --> 00:28:33,875
One day he just left on his boat and
I never saw him again, alright?

341
00:28:36,968 --> 00:28:39,061
Was this 7 years ago?

342
00:28:43,101 --> 00:28:46,875
I think I know where
they went. Our dads.

343
00:28:47,022 --> 00:28:49,210
To the bottom of the sea?

344
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:52,949
They were headed to
an uninhabited island.

345
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:55,808
Somewhere off
the coast of Japan.

346
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:58,452
Used to be called Yamatai.

347
00:28:59,833 --> 00:29:03,110
I'm gonna go there and find out
what happened to them.

348
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:05,716
Good luck.
There are at least 6,000 Islands...

349
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:06,887
off the coast of Japan.

350
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,798
Hardly any of them are populated.

351
00:29:08,822 --> 00:29:10,512
Well... I have a map.

352
00:29:10,536 --> 00:29:13,282
Now, all I need to do is to
figure out what these are.

353
00:29:14,203 --> 00:29:15,720
I think these are coordinates,

354
00:29:17,081 --> 00:29:18,345
for location.

355
00:29:23,459 --> 00:29:24,760
They're clock hands.

356
00:29:27,435 --> 00:29:28,814
They're not clock hands.

357
00:29:29,691 --> 00:29:31,993
Certainly not clock hands then.

358
00:29:36,393 --> 00:29:38,346
They are clock hands!

359
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:46,605
Three...

360
00:29:52,196 --> 00:29:53,396
It's the one!

361
00:29:54,127 --> 00:29:57,359
That's right in the middle
of the Devil's Sea.

362
00:29:57,617 --> 00:30:00,302
You might as well tie a stone to yourself
and jump off the boat now.

363
00:30:00,326 --> 00:30:02,084
It will be an adventure!

364
00:30:02,108 --> 00:30:04,098
Death is not an adventure.

365
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:07,441
Don't you even want to know
what happened to them?

366
00:30:07,465 --> 00:30:09,722
I just don't care anymore OK?

367
00:30:11,121 --> 00:30:13,196
Look, I'm a busy guy, I got stuff to do.

368
00:30:31,118 --> 00:30:33,335
How much did you lose last night?

369
00:30:34,718 --> 00:30:36,550
What makes you think I lost?

370
00:30:36,769 --> 00:30:39,396
Well it looked like you were drowning
your sorrows,

371
00:30:39,397 --> 00:30:40,781
not celebrating.

372
00:30:58,768 --> 00:31:00,765
Yours if you help
me get to Yamatai.

373
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:04,082
What will I spend it on?
Coffin?

374
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:08,561
Then I'll go get myself two
rust buckets like this for that.

375
00:31:08,585 --> 00:31:11,632
Even if you have a boat, or two...

376
00:31:11,898 --> 00:31:14,038
You'd sink them before you
even left the harbor.

377
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:17,960
What you need is an experienced Captain.

378
00:31:21,815 --> 00:31:23,768
So what's in the other shoe?

379
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:39,059
June 23rd, I may have found
the next piece to the puzzle.

380
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,209
Ancient drawings hint
to the location...

381
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:44,832
of the tomb and an elaborate
door to keep her contained.

382
00:31:45,379 --> 00:31:48,230
I found a way to
decipher the codes.

383
00:31:48,661 --> 00:31:50,550
I'm sure I can get to her.

384
00:31:59,735 --> 00:32:02,665
The ancient Nihon Chronicles
state that within the tomb

385
00:32:02,689 --> 00:32:05,896
one must face the ordeals of Himiko.

386
00:32:07,017 --> 00:32:09,513
Cross the Chasm of Souls,

387
00:32:10,248 --> 00:32:13,317
pray to survive the
faces of Himiko,

388
00:32:15,424 --> 00:32:20,109
behold her army
of a thousand hand maidens...

389
00:32:20,251 --> 00:32:22,975
descend upon Himiko's final resting place,

390
00:32:23,131 --> 00:32:25,335
unleashing her scourge.

391
00:32:36,266 --> 00:32:37,639
July 6th,

392
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,594
I'm convinced that my
progress is being monitored.

393
00:32:40,598 --> 00:32:44,356
I know them by name now,
The Order of Trinity.

394
00:32:44,357 --> 00:32:46,251
An ancient militant
organization that...

395
00:32:46,275 --> 00:32:48,913
seeks control over the
supernatural...

396
00:32:49,238 --> 00:32:51,632
to rule the fate of mankind.

397
00:32:51,656 --> 00:32:55,598
What if Himiko
is the weapon that Trinity's been seeking?

398
00:33:05,331 --> 00:33:07,265
You can't sleep?

399
00:33:16,524 --> 00:33:18,259
Enjoy it while you can.

400
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,229
We're headed into the
most dangerous stretch of water...

401
00:33:20,253 --> 00:33:22,318
between Hong Kong and California.

402
00:33:24,162 --> 00:33:26,762
Your dad sure knew how to pick a holiday.

403
00:33:29,125 --> 00:33:30,287
Yeah.

404
00:33:30,288 --> 00:33:33,921
He had a knack for the unexpected,
apparently.

405
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:40,888
I am starting to wonder
if he'd gone mad though.

406
00:33:41,288 --> 00:33:44,236
He didn't seem to know what was real,
and what wasn't.

407
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:48,373
Obsessing over some ancient
Japanese death queen.

408
00:33:48,783 --> 00:33:50,646
Hey, some men like dangerous women.

409
00:33:51,631 --> 00:33:53,779
Some men are foolish.

410
00:33:54,113 --> 00:33:55,599
What?

411
00:33:55,837 --> 00:33:59,792
Good night, Lu Ren.
Sweet dreams.

412
00:34:15,734 --> 00:34:18,913
- Not William Tell yet, but you're close.
- William Tell was a myth Dad.

413
00:34:18,937 --> 00:34:22,613
Well, all myths have foundation in reality.

414
00:34:23,881 --> 00:34:26,987
- I have to head off sprout.
- You've only just come back.

415
00:34:27,366 --> 00:34:30,645
- I'll be back before you...
- I even know you're gone.

416
00:34:31,915 --> 00:34:33,070
Ana will keep an eye on you.

417
00:34:33,094 --> 00:34:35,512
I don't need one of your
employees babysitting me.

418
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:38,485
I can take care of myself.

419
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,358
My girl.

420
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:48,778
Lara...

421
00:34:53,331 --> 00:34:55,746
Never forget dad loves you.

422
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:57,980
I know.

423
00:35:43,678 --> 00:35:46,049
I thought that might wake you.

424
00:35:46,179 --> 00:35:48,420
Your island's found us!

425
00:35:52,641 --> 00:35:54,425
Yamatai!

426
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:08,685
We've lost all control!

427
00:36:09,671 --> 00:36:11,179
We need to abandon ship!

428
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,968
- What?
- We're dead in the water.

429
00:36:12,992 --> 00:36:14,625
It's not gonna hold much longer.

430
00:36:14,649 --> 00:36:16,925
We need to get off this boat now!

431
00:36:32,397 --> 00:36:33,597
Wait!

432
00:36:34,252 --> 00:36:35,452
Dad's papers!

433
00:36:36,166 --> 00:36:38,744
Forget them! Lara!

434
00:36:59,462 --> 00:37:01,615
Lara, come on!

435
00:37:08,217 --> 00:37:09,832
Lu!

436
00:37:21,727 --> 00:37:23,177
The lifeboat!

437
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:49,435
Watch out!

438
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:26,048
Lu!

439
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,197
Lu!

440
00:39:44,658 --> 00:39:45,858
Where am I?

441
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:50,469
Aah, she's awake.

442
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:54,156
I was beginning to get worried about you.

443
00:40:00,853 --> 00:40:02,053
A reef.

444
00:40:02,978 --> 00:40:04,539
You hit it.

445
00:40:04,563 --> 00:40:06,629
Thank God I found you.

446
00:40:06,676 --> 00:40:09,352
Most people who try to come here
die in the currents.

447
00:40:09,801 --> 00:40:12,133
Almost impossible to get here.

448
00:40:12,966 --> 00:40:15,127
Even harder to leave.

449
00:40:18,988 --> 00:40:20,718
Where is my...?

450
00:40:26,772 --> 00:40:27,972
Right here.

451
00:40:34,684 --> 00:40:37,516
What are you doing here, Lara?

452
00:40:41,566 --> 00:40:43,634
I have two daughters.

453
00:40:43,889 --> 00:40:45,917
Dark hair, like you.

454
00:40:46,782 --> 00:40:49,007
Pretty like you.

455
00:40:53,046 --> 00:40:55,152
Now forgive me...

456
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:58,476
I'm rude. I haven't hosted guests
in a very long time.

457
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:01,766
My name is Mathias Vogel.

458
00:41:05,352 --> 00:41:06,723
You must be hungry.

459
00:41:11,346 --> 00:41:13,501
I used to imagine that...

460
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:18,488
I might find an ear
in one of these cans eventually.

461
00:41:20,752 --> 00:41:22,108
Isn't that mad?

462
00:41:23,344 --> 00:41:27,565
I guess being on this island for so long
can make you a little crazy.

463
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:31,105
The only person that I get to talk to

464
00:41:31,186 --> 00:41:33,042
is on the other end of this phone,

465
00:41:33,561 --> 00:41:35,511
and they always say the same thing.

466
00:41:36,762 --> 00:41:40,026
I can't go home until my work
on the island is done.

467
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:52,875
What kind of work do you do?

468
00:41:53,114 --> 00:41:56,704
Oh a mix of things,
at the mercy of my employer.

469
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:24,902
You looking for this?

470
00:42:27,014 --> 00:42:29,831
The macanations of fate
never ceases to amaze me.

471
00:42:32,081 --> 00:42:34,848
The door to Himiko.

472
00:42:36,574 --> 00:42:38,414
Richard had the entrance.

473
00:42:41,848 --> 00:42:43,376
All that wasted time.

474
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:50,368
You have brought me the thing
that I most wanted in this world.

475
00:42:51,615 --> 00:42:52,815
Thank you.

476
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:58,249
What do you know about my father?

477
00:43:01,891 --> 00:43:06,633
Now I see the likeness.
The intelligence, the face.

478
00:43:07,186 --> 00:43:08,762
The recklessness.

479
00:43:15,193 --> 00:43:17,200
All he had to was cooperate,

480
00:43:17,383 --> 00:43:20,117
Of course, being Richard he refuse

481
00:43:20,355 --> 00:43:22,149
Thought he was saving the world.

482
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,016
Where is he?

483
00:43:28,994 --> 00:43:30,350
Where is he?

484
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:32,632
To God, now.
I killed him.

485
00:43:37,763 --> 00:43:40,890
I'm sorry if I was too blunt,
I'm out of practice.

486
00:43:41,689 --> 00:43:43,509
It's been seven years.

487
00:43:45,168 --> 00:43:46,369
Seven years.

488
00:44:00,099 --> 00:44:01,437
Come on.

489
00:44:01,438 --> 00:44:03,320
Come on!

490
00:44:04,023 --> 00:44:06,275
Get down there!

491
00:44:10,308 --> 00:44:12,434
PATNA.

492
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:14,627
Move these platforms.

493
00:44:18,712 --> 00:44:21,208
- Move!
- Move!

494
00:44:23,336 --> 00:44:25,229
Let's go!

495
00:44:25,567 --> 00:44:27,182
Pick it up!

496
00:44:27,257 --> 00:44:29,142
Come on, go!

497
00:44:32,187 --> 00:44:33,419
Tie her up!

498
00:44:45,673 --> 00:44:48,357
OK, break it up!

499
00:44:49,272 --> 00:44:50,551
Back to work!

500
00:44:52,267 --> 00:44:54,399
Lara Croft!

501
00:44:54,693 --> 00:44:56,299
You shouldn't have come here.

502
00:44:57,958 --> 00:44:59,978
But I'm glad that you did.

503
00:45:02,113 --> 00:45:03,762
Pack it up!

504
00:45:04,183 --> 00:45:05,703
We're moving camp!

505
00:45:07,961 --> 00:45:09,977
Alright, let's pack it up!

506
00:45:10,058 --> 00:45:11,977
We're moving camp!

507
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:23,655
You move!

508
00:45:24,219 --> 00:45:26,480
Move it, move it!

509
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:37,650
Pick it up, come on let's go!

510
00:45:37,674 --> 00:45:39,927
Who are these people?

511
00:45:40,215 --> 00:45:43,641
Some are shipwrecked fishermen,

512
00:45:43,745 --> 00:45:46,449
And some paid smugglers to take
'em to a better life...

513
00:45:46,473 --> 00:45:48,509
Instead they brought 'em here.

514
00:45:49,796 --> 00:45:52,591
Come on! Back in Line, move!

515
00:45:52,798 --> 00:45:54,519
He said he killed my dad.

516
00:45:57,943 --> 00:46:00,128
He killed mine.

517
00:46:00,929 --> 00:46:02,878
They saw it.

518
00:46:03,217 --> 00:46:05,446
Cold-blooded murder.

519
00:46:05,968 --> 00:46:07,900
I'm sorry.

520
00:46:09,646 --> 00:46:12,313
I'm sorry that I brought you here.

521
00:46:13,156 --> 00:46:17,696
Well, you did take advantage
of a drunken sailor.

522
00:46:18,872 --> 00:46:20,794
Come on! Move!

523
00:46:20,818 --> 00:46:23,098
At least we're not dead yet.

524
00:46:23,122 --> 00:46:25,259
No shit!

525
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,826
I need some<i> CL-20 </i>up here!

526
00:47:26,699 --> 00:47:28,646
Come on let's move!

527
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:39,221
You okay?

528
00:47:39,576 --> 00:47:42,275
- Get him up and back to work right now!
- Hang on.

529
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:45,321
- Right now!
- Let him rest. We'll manage.

530
00:47:47,574 --> 00:47:51,907
- Get him back to work right now!
- He's sick man, he needs to rest.

531
00:48:47,857 --> 00:48:49,612
Get back to work!

532
00:48:58,537 --> 00:49:00,698
You heard him! Let's get back to work!

533
00:49:09,582 --> 00:49:10,800
Hey Lara...

534
00:49:10,801 --> 00:49:13,603
Lara, get ready!

535
00:49:13,857 --> 00:49:15,057
Hey.

536
00:49:16,770 --> 00:49:18,093
Go!

537
00:49:18,117 --> 00:49:19,712
Go!

538
00:49:39,356 --> 00:49:41,332
Look out!

539
00:50:03,971 --> 00:50:06,626
- Get her!
- Dammit!

540
00:50:42,264 --> 00:50:45,164
She's in the river.
Want us to follow?

541
00:50:45,188 --> 00:50:46,823
No.

542
00:50:46,912 --> 00:50:49,289
I'm sending Rocket to track her.

543
00:50:49,313 --> 00:50:52,997
If she survives, he'll bring her back.

544
00:51:09,352 --> 00:51:10,986
No!

545
00:53:36,808 --> 00:53:38,583
Really?!

546
00:57:51,677 --> 00:57:54,050
Easy now, easy.

547
00:57:55,365 --> 00:57:57,606
I'm taking you back to camp.

548
00:58:22,912 --> 00:58:25,181
Stop that struggling!

549
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:13,988
Wait!

550
01:00:25,311 --> 01:00:27,197
No, no, no!

551
01:01:02,706 --> 01:01:07,307
I'm not mad, I'm not mad.
Just ignore it, it will go away.

552
01:01:35,979 --> 01:01:37,660
Dad?

553
01:01:39,545 --> 01:01:41,191
It's me.

554
01:01:46,184 --> 01:01:47,933
Dad?

555
01:01:48,615 --> 01:01:52,369
It's not real. Ignore
it, it will go away.

556
01:01:52,388 --> 01:01:53,588
Always does.

557
01:01:54,056 --> 01:01:55,736
Look at me.

558
01:01:56,056 --> 01:01:57,971
Please.

559
01:02:03,192 --> 01:02:04,994
Do you remember this?

560
01:02:06,445 --> 01:02:07,853
We used to...

561
01:02:15,894 --> 01:02:17,740
It's me!

562
01:02:22,645 --> 01:02:24,496
It's Lara!

563
01:02:30,809 --> 01:02:32,994
Sprout!

564
01:02:37,197 --> 01:02:39,679
What in the place is you doing here?

565
01:02:46,687 --> 01:02:49,174
Dad, I'm hurt!
Help!

566
01:02:56,749 --> 01:02:58,364
Don't worry.

567
01:03:20,407 --> 01:03:23,099
- This will hurt me more than it hurts you.
- What?

568
01:03:26,961 --> 01:03:28,846
You're alright.

569
01:03:29,084 --> 01:03:31,611
You're alright.

570
01:03:32,675 --> 01:03:34,290
It's done.

571
01:03:47,081 --> 01:03:48,868
Rest now.

572
01:03:52,851 --> 01:03:54,808
Will you stay with me?

573
01:03:56,683 --> 01:03:58,802
I'm not going anywhere.

574
01:04:34,814 --> 01:04:36,942
Vogel, we found it! Yeah!

575
01:04:36,966 --> 01:04:41,510
Yeah! Come on!
We found it.

576
01:04:47,805 --> 01:04:49,035
I found it.

577
01:04:49,741 --> 01:04:51,145
Send a transport.

578
01:05:31,190 --> 01:05:32,398
I thought you'd gone.

579
01:05:32,474 --> 01:05:35,666
Usually when I see you on this
island, it's you who disappears.

580
01:05:59,392 --> 01:06:01,446
Let me do that.

581
01:06:02,371 --> 01:06:03,986
Come here.

582
01:06:10,219 --> 01:06:12,715
So sprout, where did you end up?

583
01:06:13,772 --> 01:06:16,337
Did you go to Oxford or Cambridge?

584
01:06:19,014 --> 01:06:20,903
Come on which was it?

585
01:06:21,148 --> 01:06:23,740
You know what, dad, I...

586
01:06:23,949 --> 01:06:26,475
I didn't go to University.

587
01:06:26,965 --> 01:06:29,901
Well there's time yet,
you're still only a child.

588
01:06:30,544 --> 01:06:33,986
No, I was a child when you left me.

589
01:06:34,243 --> 01:06:35,861
Careful!

590
01:06:43,948 --> 01:06:46,198
The hardest day of my life

591
01:06:47,127 --> 01:06:49,755
when I gave up trying to get back to you.

592
01:06:53,893 --> 01:06:56,551
But I realized, she'd
never let me leave.

593
01:07:00,051 --> 01:07:03,183
What are you talking about?
Who is she?

594
01:07:03,889 --> 01:07:05,736
Himiko!

595
01:07:07,292 --> 01:07:10,265
Trinity had sent Vogel
to find her tomb.

596
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:12,796
So that he could wake her
and get her power.

597
01:07:12,891 --> 01:07:14,264
I had to stop them.

598
01:07:16,447 --> 01:07:17,647
Right.

599
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:20,713
Vogel can't find the
tomb without me,

600
01:07:20,737 --> 01:07:23,710
and, since I'm dead and...

601
01:07:23,997 --> 01:07:26,795
since you've burned the rest
of my research,

602
01:07:27,764 --> 01:07:29,951
he will never find it.

603
01:07:31,183 --> 01:07:33,103
So...

604
01:07:34,246 --> 01:07:36,128
About that...

605
01:07:37,915 --> 01:07:41,890
What part of burn all my papers
did you not understand...

606
01:07:41,914 --> 01:07:44,180
If I burned the papers.

607
01:07:44,449 --> 01:07:45,789
I wouldn't have found you.

608
01:07:45,813 --> 01:07:49,159
I set diversions and false
leads where ever I could.

609
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:50,505
I watched for years

610
01:07:50,506 --> 01:07:53,447
as they got it wrong,
and now you lead them by the hand.

611
01:07:53,448 --> 01:07:57,975
So a gun toting psychopath
finds some ancient remains?

612
01:07:58,564 --> 01:08:00,180
So what?

613
01:08:00,183 --> 01:08:02,614
If Vogel opens that tomb...

614
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:05,867
Himiko's curse will
be unleashed on the world.

615
01:08:05,891 --> 01:08:11,058
- Dad, listen...
- You coming here was a mistake.

616
01:08:16,739 --> 01:08:19,132
I came here to find out
what happened to you.

617
01:08:19,133 --> 01:08:23,595
So long as the tomb was safe,
you were safe.

618
01:08:24,027 --> 01:08:26,688
I was trying to keep you safe.

619
01:08:28,282 --> 01:08:31,522
- I underestimated your...
- My what?

620
01:08:33,797 --> 01:08:36,479
- Stupidity?
- No.

621
01:08:39,260 --> 01:08:41,115
Your bravery.

622
01:08:47,319 --> 01:08:50,999
- We have to get off this Island.
- There's no way off, Lara!

623
01:08:51,023 --> 01:08:52,875
Vogel's got a satellite phone.

624
01:08:52,899 --> 01:08:55,438
We can get to it,
we can call for help.

625
01:08:55,439 --> 01:08:56,715
Vogel has an army!

626
01:08:56,716 --> 01:08:58,978
You were the one who
taught me to never give up.

627
01:09:01,884 --> 01:09:03,944
That was a different time.

628
01:09:05,535 --> 01:09:07,860
When I was a different man.

629
01:09:19,916 --> 01:09:23,121
- Lara...
- Well I'm still his daughter.

630
01:09:23,968 --> 01:09:25,651
Lara!

631
01:09:48,401 --> 01:09:50,017
Come on.

632
01:10:12,775 --> 01:10:14,393
Try another combination.

633
01:10:14,417 --> 01:10:17,255
And another one, and another one.

634
01:10:25,719 --> 01:10:29,021
Come on, come on give me the damn code.

635
01:10:29,937 --> 01:10:32,568
TRANSPORT INBOUND.

636
01:10:39,947 --> 01:10:44,164
Hey, try the explosives again.
Set another charge.

637
01:10:44,165 --> 01:10:45,814
Yes Boss.

638
01:11:07,988 --> 01:11:10,955
- Get over there.
- Stop fucking!

639
01:11:24,594 --> 01:11:27,329
Get the guns.
I'm gonna get the satphone.

640
01:11:27,353 --> 01:11:29,258
And we'll find a way for all of us
to get out of here.

641
01:11:29,282 --> 01:11:30,552
We need to leave now!

642
01:11:39,089 --> 01:11:42,080
Hey!
Vogel!

643
01:11:50,843 --> 01:11:52,219
Go!

644
01:11:52,243 --> 01:11:54,300
They're running!
Shoot them!

645
01:12:10,815 --> 01:12:12,874
- Get them to safety.
- OK.

646
01:12:17,467 --> 01:12:19,783
I'll be right behind you!
Go!

647
01:13:08,313 --> 01:13:09,928
Shit!

648
01:13:20,576 --> 01:13:21,683
We have to leave.

649
01:13:21,707 --> 01:13:25,282
I have to wait here.
I will not leave Lara.

650
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:54,187
It's beautiful, isn't it, Richard?

651
01:13:57,640 --> 01:14:00,878
I wish I would have known that you were
alive all these years.

652
01:14:02,246 --> 01:14:04,212
At least I would had
somebody to talk to.

653
01:14:17,761 --> 01:14:20,065
I need your help, Richard.

654
01:14:20,089 --> 01:14:22,205
Get the door open for me.

655
01:14:22,412 --> 01:14:24,268
It's been seven years.

656
01:14:24,269 --> 01:14:26,566
I'm going home to see my family.

657
01:14:26,590 --> 01:14:30,200
If I open that tomb,
you won't have a family!

658
01:14:30,437 --> 01:14:32,088
Open it!

659
01:14:33,301 --> 01:14:34,916
Open it!

660
01:14:35,568 --> 01:14:37,381
Open it!

661
01:14:37,727 --> 01:14:39,542
Never!

662
01:14:41,762 --> 01:14:42,873
Have it your way.

663
01:14:42,874 --> 01:14:44,465
With you or without you,

664
01:14:44,466 --> 01:14:46,749
I'm getting inside that tomb.

665
01:14:55,344 --> 01:14:57,365
Put that down!

666
01:14:58,851 --> 01:15:00,708
Put it down!

667
01:15:01,822 --> 01:15:03,236
Oh, you don't think I can pull this trigger

668
01:15:03,260 --> 01:15:04,809
before you hit me with that arrow?

669
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:06,381
Shoot him Lara, shoot him!

670
01:15:07,078 --> 01:15:08,783
Come on, put your weapon down!

671
01:15:08,807 --> 01:15:11,460
Shoot him Lara, we can't
let him get to Himiko.

672
01:15:13,787 --> 01:15:16,463
You really don't believe
this nonsense do you?

673
01:15:16,490 --> 01:15:20,377
Tell your father to open
the door or he's dead.

674
01:15:20,401 --> 01:15:22,560
You can make him do it, Lara.

675
01:15:23,434 --> 01:15:25,827
Transport's already on it's way.

676
01:15:25,898 --> 01:15:28,222
We can all be off this goddamn island.

677
01:15:28,934 --> 01:15:30,534
Let him shoot me.

678
01:15:30,702 --> 01:15:34,174
Sacrificing one life
is worth saving millions.

679
01:15:36,118 --> 01:15:37,837
It's your decision.

680
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:41,343
It's your finger
that's pulling this trigger.

681
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:49,804
- I'm sorry.
- No.

682
01:15:51,726 --> 01:15:54,733
I didn't come all this way to see you die.

683
01:16:00,734 --> 01:16:02,653
I'll do it.

684
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:09,361
I'll open it.

685
01:16:13,574 --> 01:16:16,578
Finally, a Croft with some sense.

686
01:17:52,458 --> 01:17:54,446
Ladies first.

687
01:18:21,017 --> 01:18:23,280
Mark the path.

688
01:18:54,947 --> 01:18:57,070
She's still breathing.

689
01:18:57,071 --> 01:18:59,492
Or is it change in atmospheric pressure.

690
01:18:59,493 --> 01:19:01,522
Keep walking.

691
01:19:17,944 --> 01:19:20,287
Should have seen that look on your...

692
01:19:33,003 --> 01:19:36,418
That wasn't designed
to keep people out.

693
01:19:37,490 --> 01:19:39,853
That was put there
to keep people in.

694
01:19:39,877 --> 01:19:41,596
Dad?

695
01:20:14,791 --> 01:20:16,883
Chasm of Souls.

696
01:21:12,676 --> 01:21:14,663
You're going next.

697
01:21:28,072 --> 01:21:31,303
Pray to survive the
faces of Himiko.

698
01:21:32,709 --> 01:21:34,167
We're getting closer.

699
01:21:38,445 --> 01:21:42,213
The death queen turns day to night.

700
01:21:42,769 --> 01:21:46,174
She must die to bring back life.

701
01:21:51,579 --> 01:21:53,260
Oh, shit!

702
01:22:04,833 --> 01:22:06,815
- The floor!
- Lara!

703
01:22:16,174 --> 01:22:18,829
There's gotta be a way to stop this.

704
01:22:19,369 --> 01:22:20,717
Look around!

705
01:22:23,050 --> 01:22:24,859
Come on!
Come on!

706
01:22:25,167 --> 01:22:27,959
Vogel, what's going on?

707
01:22:41,444 --> 01:22:42,605
Pray to survive!

708
01:22:42,629 --> 01:22:45,557
It's a keyhole.
We need a key!

709
01:22:46,701 --> 01:22:48,691
The prayer wheels!

710
01:22:53,065 --> 01:22:54,716
Lara!

711
01:22:58,918 --> 01:23:01,180
- It's not working.
- Check the other prayer wheels!

712
01:23:02,945 --> 01:23:04,211
Try this!

713
01:23:08,145 --> 01:23:09,561
No.

714
01:23:09,585 --> 01:23:11,200
Wait.

715
01:23:14,486 --> 01:23:15,772
It's a color puzzle.

716
01:23:18,558 --> 01:23:20,711
The death queen turns the day to night.

717
01:23:21,658 --> 01:23:24,342
- Black!
- Black! Here!

718
01:23:26,135 --> 01:23:27,014
Shit!

719
01:23:27,084 --> 01:23:28,284
Blue!

720
01:23:29,903 --> 01:23:31,735
- No!
- Here!

721
01:23:33,627 --> 01:23:34,968
It doesn't work!

722
01:23:36,474 --> 01:23:37,674
Lara!

723
01:23:44,641 --> 01:23:47,397
Last one!
Yellow!

724
01:23:53,938 --> 01:23:55,153
It's not working.

725
01:23:55,876 --> 01:23:57,631
Just try them all, dammit!

726
01:23:58,086 --> 01:24:00,575
The death queen turns day to night.

727
01:24:00,932 --> 01:24:03,538
- She must die, to bring back life.
- Life.

728
01:24:03,842 --> 01:24:05,303
Come on!

729
01:24:07,134 --> 01:24:08,552
The color of life.

730
01:24:14,829 --> 01:24:16,770
We're running out of floor!

731
01:24:23,529 --> 01:24:25,144
Green!

732
01:24:47,993 --> 01:24:50,420
You always were the brains
of the family sprout.

733
01:24:54,562 --> 01:24:56,668
Let's get going, sprout.

734
01:25:02,706 --> 01:25:04,008
Where's the floor?

735
01:25:05,339 --> 01:25:06,539
Gone.

736
01:25:21,061 --> 01:25:22,261
Flare.

737
01:25:37,694 --> 01:25:39,003
Come on, Lara.

738
01:25:41,631 --> 01:25:42,971
I'm going to look for her.

739
01:25:44,633 --> 01:25:45,973
I'm going with you.

740
01:25:46,117 --> 01:25:48,254
Your father gave life to us.

741
01:26:26,051 --> 01:26:30,532
Himiko's army...
of a thousand hand maidens.

742
01:26:32,279 --> 01:26:35,260
They sacrificed themselves
in ritual suicide...

743
01:26:35,261 --> 01:26:38,283
to serve their Queen,
in the afterlife.

744
01:26:43,691 --> 01:26:46,110
Exactly as your notes.

745
01:26:48,305 --> 01:26:49,505
I found her.

746
01:27:16,014 --> 01:27:19,026
Alright this is it, we're finishing this.

747
01:27:20,725 --> 01:27:22,899
It's not too late to change your mind.

748
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:26,405
There's a very big difference between
myth and reality, Richard.

749
01:27:26,943 --> 01:27:29,182
Something that you could
never understand.

750
01:27:30,728 --> 01:27:31,928
Gentlemen.

751
01:27:49,938 --> 01:27:51,138
Open it.

752
01:28:35,834 --> 01:28:38,455
You see I told you there was
nothing to be afraid of.

753
01:28:39,407 --> 01:28:40,669
It's just...

754
01:28:41,148 --> 01:28:42,629
an old lady.

755
01:28:45,825 --> 01:28:47,314
Prepare her for transport.

756
01:28:56,403 --> 01:28:58,119
Something doesn't add up.

757
01:28:59,482 --> 01:29:02,448
She's not a monster
in any of these paintings.

758
01:29:08,411 --> 01:29:10,939
It looks like she was taken herself here.

759
01:29:14,806 --> 01:29:16,451
Without being forced.

760
01:29:19,089 --> 01:29:21,859
The death queen turns day to night.

761
01:29:22,275 --> 01:29:26,417
- She must die to bring back life.
- Bring back life.

762
01:29:29,449 --> 01:29:33,124
Spreading death and destruction
with just the touch of her hand.

763
01:29:34,490 --> 01:29:35,690
Come on.

764
01:29:38,489 --> 01:29:40,962
All myths have foundation in reality.

765
01:29:41,142 --> 01:29:43,896
Sacrificing one life is worth
saving millions.

766
01:29:45,194 --> 01:29:46,394
Wait!

767
01:29:48,515 --> 01:29:50,870
She was sacrificing herself.

768
01:29:53,451 --> 01:29:55,144
She was protecting the world.

769
01:30:10,463 --> 01:30:11,663
See?

770
01:30:12,253 --> 01:30:13,835
Smoke and mirrors.

771
01:30:16,409 --> 01:30:17,671
Alright let's pack her up.

772
01:30:38,774 --> 01:30:40,364
They thought it was magic.

773
01:30:46,918 --> 01:30:48,509
She was the carrier.

774
01:30:50,180 --> 01:30:51,880
And she was immune...

775
01:30:58,749 --> 01:31:00,386
It's a disease.

776
01:31:53,219 --> 01:31:56,654
This is what the Trinity
wants, this gets me out.

777
01:31:56,678 --> 01:32:00,658
If you take this out into the world,
it's genocide.

778
01:32:06,817 --> 01:32:10,665
I just need to take a
very small piece of you.

779
01:33:06,092 --> 01:33:07,381
Go! Ger her!

780
01:33:07,405 --> 01:33:08,698
Get her.

781
01:33:29,228 --> 01:33:30,568
This is it, Richard.

782
01:33:31,441 --> 01:33:33,766
All we have to do
is walk out of here.

783
01:33:34,022 --> 01:33:35,320
You're not going anywhere!

784
01:33:46,958 --> 01:33:48,454
Come on, Richard.

785
01:33:51,322 --> 01:33:52,616
Think of your daughter.

786
01:34:04,101 --> 01:34:05,301
Come on!

787
01:35:59,225 --> 01:36:00,917
- Dad?
- Lara.

788
01:36:01,649 --> 01:36:02,948
Vogel's gone.

789
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:06,065
- You need to go after him.
- Come on, let's go!

790
01:36:06,174 --> 01:36:07,333
No. Stay back!

791
01:36:07,357 --> 01:36:08,957
- What are you talking?
- Stay back!

792
01:36:11,871 --> 01:36:13,071
I'm done for.

793
01:36:19,409 --> 01:36:20,609
I'm infected.

794
01:36:23,082 --> 01:36:24,282
No.

795
01:36:27,668 --> 01:36:30,102
Don't touch me! Don't touch.

796
01:36:32,017 --> 01:36:35,232
You must stop Vogel
and get the hell out of here!

797
01:36:35,460 --> 01:36:37,636
And I'll bury Himiko once and for all.

798
01:36:39,502 --> 01:36:43,478
- I've only just found you.
- Promise me you'll stop him! Promise me!

799
01:36:43,502 --> 01:36:45,059
There must be another way!

800
01:36:45,083 --> 01:36:46,283
Lara,

801
01:36:47,170 --> 01:36:49,377
you're a very very bright young woman.

802
01:36:51,081 --> 01:36:52,398
There's no other way.

803
01:37:00,054 --> 01:37:01,386
I need you.

804
01:37:02,405 --> 01:37:03,714
No, you don't.

805
01:37:04,437 --> 01:37:05,995
You are worth ten of me.

806
01:37:08,455 --> 01:37:10,587
You said you don't believe in magic.

807
01:37:10,611 --> 01:37:12,868
What's this, my darling?

808
01:37:13,228 --> 01:37:15,162
All this time here...

809
01:37:15,516 --> 01:37:18,283
I wish I could see you grow up.

810
01:37:18,618 --> 01:37:19,899
No.

811
01:37:20,111 --> 01:37:21,654
- Now I have.
- No.

812
01:37:22,092 --> 01:37:23,459
It's a miracle.

813
01:37:24,435 --> 01:37:26,286
Chin up, sprout.

814
01:37:26,577 --> 01:37:28,150
There's jobs to do.

815
01:37:30,799 --> 01:37:32,452
Go on, go!

816
01:37:33,882 --> 01:37:35,288
There's no time, Lara!

817
01:37:35,964 --> 01:37:37,164
Go on, go!

818
01:37:52,723 --> 01:37:53,923
Dad loves you.

819
01:38:55,676 --> 01:38:57,657
Do you really want to do this, little girl?

820
01:38:57,796 --> 01:38:59,037
Let's just go home.

821
01:39:13,336 --> 01:39:15,187
You're not saving anyone.

822
01:39:15,859 --> 01:39:17,239
Trinity is everywhere.

823
01:39:20,513 --> 01:39:21,713
Yeah?

824
01:40:00,650 --> 01:40:02,170
I made a promise.

825
01:40:06,745 --> 01:40:09,179
No, no, no!

826
01:40:09,783 --> 01:40:11,223
You're not getting out of here!

827
01:40:11,736 --> 01:40:13,670
No, no!

828
01:41:13,388 --> 01:41:15,010
When you see Richard,

829
01:41:16,036 --> 01:41:17,611
send him my regards.

830
01:41:59,352 --> 01:42:00,841
Send them yourself.

831
01:42:17,861 --> 01:42:19,694
You messed with
the wrong family!

832
01:44:18,569 --> 01:44:19,893
Lara!

833
01:44:26,572 --> 01:44:27,772
Lara!

834
01:44:36,625 --> 01:44:37,825
Lara?

835
01:45:19,813 --> 01:45:21,013
Well.

836
01:45:21,784 --> 01:45:23,022
We're not dead yet.

837
01:45:27,555 --> 01:45:28,801
No shit.

838
01:45:54,260 --> 01:45:57,834
Vogel, Vogel, this is Patna transport
Bravo 5, over.

839
01:46:01,166 --> 01:46:03,514
Vogel, Vogel, are you reading me? Over.

840
01:46:05,037 --> 01:46:06,237
Boss.

841
01:46:10,024 --> 01:46:11,450
You're taking us home, yeah?

842
01:46:40,838 --> 01:46:44,787
LONDON.

843
01:46:44,841 --> 01:46:48,527
MISS LARA CROFT.

844
01:46:50,704 --> 01:46:53,736
Officially gone, like magic.

845
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:55,428
I don't think he has gone.

846
01:46:56,885 --> 01:47:00,311
- I see so much of him in you.
- Thanks, Ana.

847
01:47:00,819 --> 01:47:02,019
Really.

848
01:47:03,171 --> 01:47:04,933
You're in charge now, Lara.

849
01:47:06,788 --> 01:47:09,698
This is a list of all our assets.

850
01:47:09,860 --> 01:47:11,060
Thank you.

851
01:47:11,633 --> 01:47:15,520
Now I think you better stay on top
of the day to day things, Ana.

852
01:47:15,598 --> 01:47:17,676
Well, as you wish...

853
01:47:18,135 --> 01:47:20,301
Board rooms and business deals.

854
01:47:20,435 --> 01:47:22,301
I'm just not that kind of Croft.

855
01:47:29,754 --> 01:47:33,243
Neither was dad, as it turns out.

856
01:47:48,151 --> 01:47:50,351
Are all these companies
owned by us?

857
01:47:51,121 --> 01:47:52,321
Yes.

858
01:48:33,738 --> 01:48:35,476
I know them by name now.

859
01:48:35,668 --> 01:48:37,633
The Order of Trinity.

860
01:48:39,930 --> 01:48:41,943
An ancient militant
organization that...

861
01:48:41,967 --> 01:48:44,359
seeks control of the
supernatural...

862
01:48:44,382 --> 01:48:46,672
in order to rule the fate of mankind.

863
01:48:46,696 --> 01:48:49,764
PATNA
CONFIDENTIAL.

864
01:48:50,836 --> 01:48:52,613
What kind of work do you do?

865
01:48:53,571 --> 01:48:57,552
Oh a mix of things,
at the mercy of my employer.

866
01:48:58,254 --> 01:49:00,415
Are all these companies
owned by us?

867
01:49:01,083 --> 01:49:02,870
PATNA LTD.

868
01:49:03,450 --> 01:49:04,993
You're not saving anyone.

869
01:49:06,053 --> 01:49:07,891
Trinity is everywhere.

870
01:49:09,074 --> 01:49:11,242
I know it's difficult to accept,

871
01:49:11,266 --> 01:49:13,942
but you really must come in
and sign these papers now.

872
01:49:14,476 --> 01:49:18,168
I think you better stay on top
of the day to day things, Ana.

873
01:49:19,199 --> 01:49:20,124
As you wish...

874
01:49:20,148 --> 01:49:22,590
The only person that I get to talk to...

875
01:49:22,897 --> 01:49:25,371
is on the other end of this phone.

876
01:49:35,449 --> 01:49:37,275
You must understand,

877
01:49:37,299 --> 01:49:39,477
We Crofts, we have
responsibilities...

878
01:49:42,197 --> 01:49:43,709
jobs to do.

879
01:49:43,847 --> 01:49:49,748
TOMB RAIDER
THE ADVENTURES OF LARA CROFT

880
01:49:53,782 --> 01:49:56,086
Oh, you again.

881
01:49:59,036 --> 01:50:00,657
I came back for the amulet.

882
01:50:00,973 --> 01:50:02,907
Shame, I was hoping you'd forgotten.

883
01:50:03,294 --> 01:50:04,821
It's got a bloody fortune.

884
01:50:04,863 --> 01:50:08,602
- I did tell you it was your lucky day.
- Yes you did.

885
01:50:09,844 --> 01:50:11,356
At it again, are we Alan?

886
01:50:11,426 --> 01:50:12,785
You have no idea.

887
01:50:20,111 --> 01:50:22,511
I don't know if you've noticed or not, but

888
01:50:22,535 --> 01:50:24,817
You can't be too careful these days,
because the world

889
01:50:24,841 --> 01:50:26,106
has gone bloody mad.

890
01:50:26,130 --> 01:50:27,953
Yes, thank you, Alan.

891
01:50:28,966 --> 01:50:32,502
What you got there is a HK USP,
9 mil, extended mag.

892
01:50:33,239 --> 01:50:34,806
It's my personal favorite.

893
01:50:38,045 --> 01:50:39,245
You like that?

894
01:50:40,061 --> 01:50:41,261
I do.

895
01:50:44,011 --> 01:50:45,211
I'll take two.
