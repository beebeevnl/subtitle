1
0:0:1.090 --> 0:0:3.125
Swiping to the left.

2
0:0:3.159 --> 0:0:5.262
What, you don't do
Tinder in America?

3
0:0:5.294 --> 0:0:6.630
Tinder what?

4
0:0:6.662 --> 0:0:9.666
Do you know, I think it's
probably a generational thing.

5
0:0:9.698 --> 0:0:12.669
It translates as
"Go away, old man."

6
0:0:16.072 --> 0:0:17.307
Be good, be cool.

7
0:0:17.740 --> 0:0:18.809
Bye.

8
0:0:20.242 --> 0:0:22.078
Thank you for that.

9
0:0:22.111 --> 0:0:24.247
I'm Clara.
River.

10
0:0:24.280 --> 0:0:27.249
Bloody hell, is that the time?

11
0:0:27.282 --> 0:0:28.384
You know what, I'm so jetlagged

12
0:0:28.418 --> 0:0:30.352
I don't know
if I'm coming or going.

13
0:0:30.387 --> 0:0:31.955
Where've you been?
Anywhere nice?

14
0:0:31.988 --> 0:0:35.258
South America. Been spending
a bit of time out there.

15
0:0:35.291 --> 0:0:36.526
Training with the shaman,

16
0:0:36.559 --> 0:0:38.795
and trying to really connect
with my spirit animal.

17
0:0:38.829 --> 0:0:40.964
Yeah.
I'm a crow.

18
0:0:40.997 --> 0:0:42.700
And, hang on, let me guess...

19
0:0:42.733 --> 0:0:44.334
No.
Jaguar.

20
0:0:44.367 --> 0:0:46.470
What? No! Oh, my God!

21
0:0:46.503 --> 0:0:48.572
Yes?
How did you even know that?

22
0:0:48.604 --> 0:0:51.273
Look, it totally is.
Check it out.

23
0:0:51.307 --> 0:0:53.909
Oh. Ino Moxo.
Black jaguar. Very nice.

24
0:0:53.943 --> 0:0:57.113
You know what?
I wanna buy you a drink.

25
0:0:59.416 --> 0:1:1.418
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

26
0:1:5.822 --> 0:1:7.758
MERLIN: Eggsy sent this
from Glastonbury.

27
0:1:9.791 --> 0:1:13.363
And #bluerash is
trending on Twitter.

28
0:1:13.396 --> 0:1:15.698
Have you found any correlation
between these cases?

29
0:1:15.731 --> 0:1:17.833
Only recreational drug use.

30
0:1:17.867 --> 0:1:18.901
Ah.

31
0:1:20.204 --> 0:1:22.139
I know.
Not very Statesman-like.

32
0:1:22.872 --> 0:1:24.573
Tequila here...

33
0:1:24.608 --> 0:1:27.810
he is our resident bad boy.

34
0:1:27.843 --> 0:1:29.311
You don't think
this could be related

35
0:1:29.345 --> 0:1:31.514
to The Golden Circle, do you?

36
0:1:31.548 --> 0:1:35.450
A drug cartel
poisoning its customers?

37
0:1:35.485 --> 0:1:36.787
Doesn't make sense.

38
0:1:37.119 --> 0:1:38.488
Mmm.

39
0:1:43.726 --> 0:1:45.863
CHARLIE: Poppy, would you
pass the sugar, please?

40
0:1:46.396 --> 0:1:48.064
POPPY: Okay.

41
0:1:48.097 --> 0:1:51.802
But it's really bad for you.

42
0:1:51.834 --> 0:1:54.871
Eight times more addictive
than cocaine.

43
0:1:54.905 --> 0:1:57.541
Five times more likely
to cause death.

44
0:1:57.573 --> 0:1:59.209
But it's legal...

45
0:1:59.242 --> 0:2:1.544
so, you go ahead.
Knock yourself out.

46
0:2:2.845 --> 0:2:5.981
Don't get me started
on tobacco and alcohol.

47
0:2:6.015 --> 0:2:8.418
Peddle that stuff
and you're in Fortune 500.

48
0:2:8.450 --> 0:2:10.086
But me? No!

49
0:2:10.119 --> 0:2:11.521
I'm out here hiding

50
0:2:11.555 --> 0:2:14.224
in the middle of
nowhere. Homesick.

51
0:2:14.256 --> 0:2:15.624
Because I sell drugs.

52
0:2:15.657 --> 0:2:19.161
Oh, Pops. You're doing this
because you're homesick?

53
0:2:19.195 --> 0:2:20.897
POPPY: Yes.

54
0:2:20.930 --> 0:2:23.199
I want freedom.

55
0:2:23.233 --> 0:2:25.135
I want fame.

56
0:2:25.168 --> 0:2:28.537
Our profits were
250 billion dollars last year.

57
0:2:28.572 --> 0:2:30.039
I am the most successful
businesswoman

58
0:2:30.072 --> 0:2:32.208
in the world,
but nobody knows who I am.

59
0:2:32.242 --> 0:2:33.377
Pops, Pops.

60
0:2:33.410 --> 0:2:35.345
It's not long now, eh?

61
0:2:35.378 --> 0:2:37.313
You're right, thank you.

62
0:2:37.345 --> 0:2:38.715
ANGEL: Sorry to interrupt you.

63
0:2:38.747 --> 0:2:41.383
You wanted to see me,
Madam Poppy?

64
0:2:41.416 --> 0:2:44.453
Yes, Angel.
In The Golden Circle...

65
0:2:44.486 --> 0:2:46.655
we do not sample
the merchandise...

66
0:2:46.689 --> 0:2:49.693
and we do not break the rules.

67
0:2:49.726 --> 0:2:52.461
Which is why I have
invested in robots...

68
0:2:52.496 --> 0:2:54.831
because they are
so much more reliable

69
0:2:54.863 --> 0:2:57.166
and trustworthy
than human beings.

70
0:2:58.101 --> 0:2:59.470
