00:15:00,072 --> 00:15:01,805
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

183
00:15:01,807 --> 00:15:04,811
Yeah, Charlotte, yeah.

184
00:15:08,948 --> 00:15:12,184
Let's get you home, Pops, hmm?

- [sighs]
- Hey.

190
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:33,099
Don't you puss out on me, man.

191
00:17:07,565 --> 00:17:09,899
So how often do you make
this run up north again?

192
00:17:09,901 --> 00:17:12,336
About every two weeks.

193
00:17:12,338 --> 00:17:15,138
Okay, any other drivers
that make this run?

194
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,407
We're not gonna involve
anyone else, man.

195
00:17:17,409 --> 00:17:20,977
Why the fuck not? That's how
you branch out, move up.

196
00:17:20,979 --> 00:17:23,914
There ain't nobody else you can
trust to bring on this deal?

197
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:25,215
It's not about trust, man.

198
00:17:25,217 --> 00:17:27,050
I'm just not
involving anyone else.

199
00:17:27,052 --> 00:17:28,886
That's why you're always
gonna stay a fucking runner.

200
00:17:28,888 --> 00:17:31,221
That's fine, man.
I'm just gonna collect my money.

00:18:00,486 --> 00:18:01,651
Oh, Jesus Christ.

210
00:18:01,653 --> 00:18:03,320
What the fuck is wrong with you?

211
00:18:03,322 --> 00:18:06,089
All you had to do was drive
the fucking truck, man!

212
00:18:06,091 --> 00:18:07,390
We gotta get this shit
out of here

213
00:18:07,392 --> 00:18:09,059
before somebody comes, man.

214
00:18:09,061 --> 00:18:11,965
Fuck. Go get my bag

- Where is it?
- Right here, right here.

218
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,080
Give me the fucking flashlight.

219
00:18:31,082 --> 00:18:33,417
- Right here?
- Crack that fucker open.

220
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:34,517

That's my fucking truck!

225
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,629
Relax.
Open the fucking log.

226
00:18:46,631 --> 00:18:49,265
Dude, just get back here.
Hurry up.

[chopping]

228
00:18:53,538 --> 00:18:55,472
Jesus, that's a lotta dope.

229
00:18:55,474 --> 00:18:57,139
I know. Kinda makes you hard,
don't it?

230
00:18:57,141 --> 00:18:58,742
[laughs] Come on.
Load the fucking bag up.

231
00:18:58,744 --> 00:19:02,247
- Here, take it out of the bag.
- Oh, fuck.

232
00:19:04,248 --> 00:19:05,514
Fuck.

233
00:19:05,516 --> 00:19:08,187
Fuck. We need to
extinguish this, man.

234
00:19:10,221 --> 00:19:12,356
We gotta get rid of the dope
before the cops come.

235
00:19:12,358 --> 00:19:14,023
Just get it in the bag.

236
00:19:14,025 --> 00:19:16,193
Dude, just figure out
where we're gonna go.

237
00:19:16,195 --> 00:19:17,660
All right.

238
00:19:17,662 --> 00:19:20,097
We're not too far
from my boss' cabin.

239
00:19:20,099 --> 00:19:22,733
It's a couple miles up the road.
We'll stash it there.

240
00:19:22,735 --> 00:19:24,670
All right, let's go.

It's almost
one in the morning.

248
00:20:15,521 --> 00:20:17,821
I'm almost done.
Go back inside.

249
00:20:17,823 --> 00:20:19,292
Joe.

Hey.

253
00:20:31,803 --> 00:20:34,407
I don't wanna put my dad
in a home.

254
00:20:49,388 --> 00:20:52,358
He's the strongest man
I've ever known.

255
00:20:54,258 --> 00:20:56,128
Now look at him.

256
00:21:01,233 --> 00:21:04,037
I don't want Charlotte
seeing him like that.

257
00:21:09,373 --> 00:21:11,076
I know.

258
00:21:12,611 --> 00:21:14,414
But we're a family.

259
00:21:17,515 --> 00:21:18,650
Okay?

260
00:21:20,451 --> 00:21:22,721
And we will
make it through this.

261
00:21:24,622 --> 00:21:28,126
Maybe this doesn't have
to be our decision alone.

262
00:21:30,361 --> 00:21:32,665
You can talk to your dad.

263
00:21:34,867 --> 00:21:37,199
Take him to the cabin.

264
00:21:37,201 --> 00:21:40,270
Just you and him.

265
00:21:40,272 --> 00:21:42,542
You know he loves it there.

266
00:21:44,709 --> 00:21:47,646
Just get the conversation
started.

267
00:21:51,682 --> 00:21:52,651
Hey.

268
00:22:25,316 --> 00:22:28,186
- All right, this is it.
- Thank God.

You sure it's good here?

00:22:44,369 --> 00:22:46,405
Yeah. Joe's not
coming up here, man.

00:23:10,963 --> 00:23:12,265
Here.

277
00:23:15,367 --> 00:23:17,900
All right, good, man.
We'll pick it up tomorrow.

278
00:23:17,902 --> 00:23:19,769
Fuck.

279
00:23:19,771 --> 00:23:21,370
Dude, I'm freezing.

280
00:23:21,372 --> 00:23:23,406
Just fucking take it
if you're fucking cold.

281
00:23:23,408 --> 00:23:24,506
Dude, I'm trying
to share with you.

Thank God.

00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:37,286
Shit.

287
00:23:37,288 --> 00:23:40,357

This is really funny
to you, huh?

That shit on the side
of the road, that's my life.

00:23:51,836 --> 00:23:53,637
You should be worried
about Kassen.

294
00:23:53,639 --> 00:23:56,742
I gotta make the call,
so shut the fuck up about it.

295
00:24:14,659 --> 00:24:16,461
What's up, Kassen?

296
00:24:18,964 --> 00:24:20,897
Are you hungry?

297
00:24:20,899 --> 00:24:23,502
Pancakes here ain't half bad.

Look, I know that I fucked up,

299

but I'll make
this thing right.

I'm good. I feel good.

Hey, I'm feeling like
I'm ready to go back to work.

00:27:12,838 --> 00:27:15,538
I think you need to take
the day off, Dad, okay?

345
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,674
I was thinking maybe
we'd go up to the cabin.

Cabin? What for?

347
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:23,612
Well, you can help me

your old man

All right, I'll go.

I wanna go. Please?

Hey, I'll take you hunting.

from your dad.

I don't have to work today,

around here.

No, ma'am.

00:27:49,807 --> 00:27:51,707
Dad, I never see you.

361
00:27:51,709 --> 00:27:53,141
Charlotte, listen to me.
I owe you, okay, baby?

362
00:27:53,143 --> 00:27:54,511
I promise I'll take you
next time.

363
00:27:54,513 --> 00:27:56,612
You always say that.

364
00:27:56,614 --> 00:27:58,049
She's yours.

365
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:01,850
Listen, I got everything
packed up,

366
00:28:01,852 --> 00:28:03,520
so you wanna
grab your stuff?

367
00:28:03,522 --> 00:28:07,092
All right. You mind
if I eat an egg first?

368
00:28:16,868 --> 00:28:18,600
I'll drive.

369
00:28:18,602 --> 00:28:21,303
[laughs]
I got it, Pops, I got it.

370
00:28:21,305 --> 00:28:22,507
All right.

371
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:27,646
[engine starts]

372
00:28:30,582 --> 00:28:32,051
Get comfy, old man.

373
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,009
HALLETT: Shit.

374
00:30:46,383 --> 00:30:48,120
Ah.

375
00:30:49,187 --> 00:30:51,255
- Hey.
- Hey.

376
00:30:54,426 --> 00:30:56,729
Goddamn! You get off
on this shit, huh?

377
00:30:58,063 --> 00:30:59,962
Nice G.I. Joe gear, boy.

378
00:30:59,964 --> 00:31:01,697
Who's your friend?

379
00:31:01,699 --> 00:31:03,699
This is Weston, man.
He's gonna lead the way.

380
00:31:03,701 --> 00:31:05,167
Okay.

381
00:31:05,169 --> 00:31:06,869
Why don't you
ride with Gentry?

382
00:31:06,871 --> 00:31:09,108
You can ride with us, Weston.

383
00:31:10,408 --> 00:31:12,410
Gentlemen!
[imitates gunshot]

384
00:31:16,081 --> 00:31:18,684
Hey, hey, hey, hey, easy, man.

385
00:31:19,784 --> 00:31:21,754
Hey, what's up, man?

386
00:31:24,421 --> 00:31:25,990
How you doing?

387
00:31:28,493 --> 00:31:29,762
[sighs]

388
00:31:36,301 --> 00:31:37,966
Good.

389
00:31:37,968 --> 00:31:40,302
We got power.

390
00:31:40,304 --> 00:31:43,374
We'll get those curtains open,
let some light in.

391
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,501
Somebody left the crib
half empty.

392
00:32:11,503 --> 00:32:13,235
Wanna bring in some timber?

393
00:32:13,237 --> 00:32:14,273
Yep.

394
00:32:29,353 --> 00:32:30,288
There you go.

395
00:32:32,791 --> 00:32:34,823
Can I talk to you
for a second, Dad?

396
00:32:34,825 --> 00:32:37,326
Why don't you get
the coffee going?

397
00:32:37,328 --> 00:32:41,062
Yeah, yeah, just a minute.

398
00:32:41,064 --> 00:32:43,000
Can I ask you something?

399
00:32:51,342 --> 00:32:54,979
You remember what happened
last night at the bar?

400
00:32:57,247 --> 00:33:00,015
I had a disagreement,
wound up with 11 stitches.

401
00:33:00,017 --> 00:33:02,851
Yeah, I remember.

402
00:33:02,853 --> 00:33:05,554
You grabbed a woman by the arm
and tried to pull her out.

403
00:33:05,556 --> 00:33:08,293
They said you thought
she was Mom.

404
00:33:10,027 --> 00:33:12,497
Nah. I don't think so.

405
00:33:16,066 --> 00:33:18,600
Do you remember seeing
Charlotte at the hospital?

406
00:33:18,602 --> 00:33:22,972
Hey, what is this, huh?
What are you doing?

407
00:33:22,974 --> 00:33:25,144
What are these questions?

408
00:33:27,011 --> 00:33:30,378
The doctor thinks you need
a different kind of supervision.

409
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,849
[scoffs]

410
00:33:32,851 --> 00:33:34,917
I need to be supervised?

411
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:37,086
No, but when you go off
and do stuff that...

412
00:33:37,088 --> 00:33:40,523
What else does the doctor think?

413
00:33:40,525 --> 00:33:43,525
I need to be put somewhere,
maybe put in a home, huh?

414
00:33:43,527 --> 00:33:45,427
No, we're not
doing that, okay?

415
00:33:45,429 --> 00:33:47,263
But we gotta talk about
something else that we can do.

416
00:33:47,265 --> 00:33:49,398
Oh, we do, huh?
Let me tell you something.

417
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,068
When my old man
gave me the mill,

418
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:53,636
he didn't have to because
he could still get it done,

419
00:33:53,638 --> 00:33:54,936
and so could I.

420
00:33:54,938 --> 00:33:56,371
I didn't put him out to pasture.

421
00:33:56,373 --> 00:33:58,040
I didn't put him
in some goddamn home

422
00:33:58,042 --> 00:33:59,442
with a bunch of drooling,
bedwetting old bastards.

423
00:33:59,444 --> 00:34:00,976
I'm not gonna
put you in a home.

424
00:34:00,978 --> 00:34:03,512
You're goddamn right
you're not!

425
00:34:03,514 --> 00:34:05,117
Pops...

426
00:34:06,484 --> 00:34:07,586
Yeah.

427
00:34:09,419 --> 00:34:12,088
I forget some things now,
all right?

428
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:15,390
Hey, why don't you try
falling 40 feet

429
00:34:15,392 --> 00:34:17,894
with nothing
but a helicopter dash

430
00:34:17,896 --> 00:34:19,461
to break your fall?

431
00:34:19,463 --> 00:34:22,365
See how you wind up, huh?

432
00:34:22,367 --> 00:34:24,499
Hot shot.

433
00:34:24,501 --> 00:34:27,669
Pops, I don't wanna fight.
I just wanna talk.

434
00:34:27,671 --> 00:34:29,338
Yeah?

435
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:32,077
Is it working out the way
you thought it would?

436
00:34:33,378 --> 00:34:35,247
Goddamn it.

437
00:34:37,014 --> 00:34:38,150
[door slams]

438
00:34:43,421 --> 00:34:44,523
[sighs]

439
00:35:17,121 --> 00:35:19,557
WESTON: Shit.
Stop right here.

440
00:35:29,499 --> 00:35:30,501
Ah, shit.

441
00:35:34,972 --> 00:35:36,474
Uh, I think, uh...

442
00:35:38,041 --> 00:35:40,041
I think Joe
might be up here, man.

443
00:35:40,043 --> 00:35:41,410
Dude, what the fuck
are you talking about?

444
00:35:41,412 --> 00:35:43,211
You said the bag
would be safe.

445
00:35:43,213 --> 00:35:44,482
All right.

446
00:35:47,017 --> 00:35:48,483
Any other roads out of here?

447
00:35:48,485 --> 00:35:51,253
No, this is the only one.
There's ATV trails

448
00:35:51,255 --> 00:35:53,122
that go to the back ravines
and Blue Mountain,

449
00:35:53,124 --> 00:35:54,557
but this is the only road.

450
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:56,624
The cabin's about
a half-mile away.

451
00:35:56,626 --> 00:35:58,059
Cell service?

452
00:35:58,061 --> 00:36:00,363
Not up here.

453
00:36:00,365 --> 00:36:03,298
Except for maybe up
on Blue Mountain.

454
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,734
All right, we're gonna secure
the road 150 yards out.

455
00:36:05,736 --> 00:36:08,370
Clay, Louisi,
take the east side of the road.

456
00:36:08,372 --> 00:36:11,573
Ridley, Essington,
you take the west of the road.

457
00:36:11,575 --> 00:36:13,075
We're gonna flank him.
Gear up.

458
00:36:13,077 --> 00:36:15,644
Yo, G.I. Joe,
let me get one of those.

459
00:36:15,646 --> 00:36:17,245
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

460
00:36:17,247 --> 00:36:20,048
Look, I know this guy.
Let me talk to him.

461
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:22,318
- What is this, man?
- Talk to him, motherfucker?

462
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,653
We just need to go back in there
and get our shit.

463
00:36:24,655 --> 00:36:27,756
Anyone who hasn't royally
fucked up in the last 24 hours,

464
00:36:27,758 --> 00:36:29,524
raise your hand.

465
00:36:29,526 --> 00:36:32,128
Shut the fuck up
and do as you're told.

466
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:33,365
Hit it.

467
00:36:48,111 --> 00:36:49,347
[sighs]

468
00:37:05,829 --> 00:37:07,198
What the...

469
00:37:10,233 --> 00:37:11,369
[grunts]

470
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:28,586
Latch is busted.

471
00:37:31,722 --> 00:37:34,126
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know.

472
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,126
Yeah.

473
00:37:38,128 --> 00:37:39,829
There's tracks out there.

474
00:37:39,831 --> 00:37:41,166
Footprints...

475
00:37:43,101 --> 00:37:44,736
...around here.

476
00:37:47,238 --> 00:37:48,740
[click]

477
00:37:50,508 --> 00:37:51,707
Hi, Daddy.

478
00:37:51,709 --> 00:37:54,178
Charlotte, what are you
doing here?

479
00:37:55,512 --> 00:37:57,879
Does your mother know
where you are?

480
00:37:57,881 --> 00:37:59,682
I left her a note.

481
00:37:59,684 --> 00:38:01,383
Were you in the back
of my truck?

482
00:38:01,385 --> 00:38:04,687
- Yeah.
- Baby, you're a rascal.

483
00:38:04,689 --> 00:38:05,791
Pops, let's go!

484
00:38:12,697 --> 00:38:14,296
Is everyone in position?

485
00:38:14,298 --> 00:38:15,865
Not yet.

486
00:38:15,867 --> 00:38:17,202
Almost.

487
00:38:24,142 --> 00:38:26,575
Dad, I'm sorry.

488
00:38:26,577 --> 00:38:28,180
Get in the car.

489
00:38:33,217 --> 00:38:34,485
[engine starts]

490
00:39:09,753 --> 00:39:12,254
Another male rides shotgun.

491
00:39:12,256 --> 00:39:13,725
<i>Take 'em both out.</i>

492
00:39:33,244 --> 00:39:34,776
POPS: What?

493
00:39:34,778 --> 00:39:36,213
Something's not right.

494
00:39:41,852 --> 00:39:43,455
SNIPER: Come on.

495
00:39:44,588 --> 00:39:46,357
Baby, get down, get down.

496
00:39:52,762 --> 00:39:54,231
No shot.

497
00:39:55,865 --> 00:39:58,267
Let's move to the perimeter
of the cabin.

498
00:39:58,269 --> 00:40:00,336
<i>Essington,
take the back east corner.</i>

499
00:40:00,338 --> 00:40:02,771
<i>Louisi, front east.</i>

500
00:40:02,773 --> 00:40:04,807
<i>Ridley, you'll take
the front west.</i>

501
00:40:04,809 --> 00:40:06,608
<i>And, Clay, take the rear west.</i>

502
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:08,811
Let me know when
you're each in position.

503
00:40:08,813 --> 00:40:10,479
Let's go.

504
00:40:10,481 --> 00:40:12,551
You can ride
in the big boy's seat.

505
00:40:13,684 --> 00:40:15,287
Fuck, man.

506
00:40:35,972 --> 00:40:38,474
- Close the curtains, Pops.
- CHARLOTTE: What's going on?

507
00:40:38,476 --> 00:40:41,412
It's gonna be all right, baby.
It's gonna be all right.

508
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:47,582
CHARLOTTE: Daddy?

509
00:40:47,584 --> 00:40:49,653
It's gonna be okay,
baby, okay?

510
00:40:58,863 --> 00:41:01,597
- The CB is in the shed.
- You good to shoot?

511
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:03,301
What do you think?

512
00:41:05,769 --> 00:41:07,870
- Dad?
- It's gonna be okay, baby.

513
00:41:07,872 --> 00:41:09,872
Grandpa and I gotta do
a few things, all right?

514
00:41:09,874 --> 00:41:12,244
- I can help.
- Help by staying out of sight.

515
00:41:16,914 --> 00:41:18,946
It is very important that
you do not open this door

516
00:41:18,948 --> 00:41:19,981
unless it's for me, okay?

517
00:41:19,983 --> 00:41:21,716
- Okay.
- All right, baby.

518
00:41:21,718 --> 00:41:23,619
Get in there.

519
00:41:23,621 --> 00:41:24,956
Okay, I love you.

520
00:41:53,684 --> 00:41:54,686
Ehh.

521
00:41:56,419 --> 00:41:58,986
Once you're in position,
check in.

522
00:41:58,988 --> 00:42:00,622
ESSINGTON: <i>Copy. Rear east.</i>

523
00:42:00,624 --> 00:42:02,624
CLAY: <i>I got rear west.</i>

524
00:42:02,626 --> 00:42:03,691
RIDLEY: <i>Copy. Front west.</i>

525
00:42:03,693 --> 00:42:05,561
LOUISI: <i>Roger. Rear east.</i>

526
00:42:05,563 --> 00:42:07,965
KASSEN: <i>Hold your positions
until the bag is secure.</i>

527
00:42:44,735 --> 00:42:46,968
This is Joe Braven up on
Blue Mountain. Does anyone copy?

528
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:49,137
[static, indistinct voice]

529
00:42:49,139 --> 00:42:52,039
This is Joe Braven on
Blue Mountain. Do you copy?

530
00:42:52,041 --> 00:42:54,443
MAN: <i>This is Fish and Game.
Go ahead, Joe.</i>

531
00:42:54,445 --> 00:42:56,581
- This is Joe Braven.
- [static]

532
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:22,137
Come on, man.
Why we standing around?

533
00:43:22,139 --> 00:43:25,376
Give me a gun. I'll go in there
and get it myself.

534
00:43:26,477 --> 00:43:27,876
[sighs]

535
00:43:27,878 --> 00:43:30,479
Do you know this guy?

536
00:43:30,481 --> 00:43:31,850
Yeah, man.

537
00:43:33,117 --> 00:43:35,053
Tell me about him.

538
00:43:38,789 --> 00:43:40,222
How many of them?

539
00:43:40,224 --> 00:43:42,660
I make four, at least.

540
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,996
But you need to see this.

541
00:43:53,637 --> 00:43:55,807
- Motherfucker.
- Yeah.

542
00:43:58,709 --> 00:44:00,075
What are you gonna do?

543
00:44:00,077 --> 00:44:02,577
- I'm gonna go talk to him.
- No, no.

544
00:44:02,579 --> 00:44:04,579
With that amount of drugs,
they're not here to talk.

545
00:44:04,581 --> 00:44:08,051
They're gonna size you up,
take you out, then come for us.

546
00:44:10,921 --> 00:44:12,023
I got an idea.

547
00:44:14,258 --> 00:44:15,894
Son of a bitch.

548
00:44:29,539 --> 00:44:32,476
Hey, you know
what you're doing?

549
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:35,179
I think so, Pops.

550
00:44:36,847 --> 00:44:39,082
KASSEN: Why don't you
go bring him out?

551
00:44:41,818 --> 00:44:43,184
Look, his family's in there.

552
00:44:43,186 --> 00:44:45,019
Let's just come back
for the shit, man.

553
00:44:45,021 --> 00:44:47,555
Motherfucker's got our drugs.

554
00:44:47,557 --> 00:44:50,027
KASSEN: Just bring him out.

555
00:45:06,075 --> 00:45:07,276
He's coming out.

556
00:45:07,278 --> 00:45:09,046
Louisi, Ridley,
come in from behind.

557
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:15,019
Well, look at you.

558
00:45:18,789 --> 00:45:20,725
I'm so sorry, man.

559
00:45:25,863 --> 00:45:28,062
Ah, Mr. Braven.

560
00:45:28,064 --> 00:45:30,034
Sorry to interrupt your day.

561
00:45:33,003 --> 00:45:35,106
- [thud]
- Yeah.

562
00:45:41,778 --> 00:45:44,081
Where the fuck's
the rest of it?

563
00:45:48,285 --> 00:45:51,986
If you shoot me, my guys
will burn the other half.

564
00:45:51,988 --> 00:45:53,957
Okay.

565
00:45:56,126 --> 00:45:58,059
You clear off my property.

566
00:45:58,061 --> 00:46:00,963
I'll meet you in town
at the Waverlin Cafe in an hour.

567
00:46:00,965 --> 00:46:02,664
I'll bring the rest of it,
and you'll never see me again.

568
00:46:02,666 --> 00:46:03,999
Oh, no, no, no, fuck that.

569
00:46:04,001 --> 00:46:06,167
You get your Sasquatch ass
back in there

570
00:46:06,169 --> 00:46:08,003
and bring all of it out now,
motherfucker.

571
00:46:08,005 --> 00:46:11,807
No, Joe,
I don't wanna go into town.

572
00:46:11,809 --> 00:46:13,941
A city boy like me
wouldn't be welcome there.

573
00:46:13,943 --> 00:46:19,784
And besides, what if I run
into Stephanie or Charlotte?

574
00:46:22,753 --> 00:46:25,754
I didn't come here
to kill good people.

575
00:46:25,756 --> 00:46:27,189
I just want
what belongs to me.

576
00:46:27,191 --> 00:46:29,127
Joe, just do
what they want and then...

577
00:46:32,829 --> 00:46:35,664
So how 'bout you go inside,
get the rest of it,

578
00:46:35,666 --> 00:46:37,899
and then we'll be on our way.

579
00:46:37,901 --> 00:46:39,635
Could you do that for me, Joe?

580
00:46:39,637 --> 00:46:41,803
Please?

581
00:46:41,805 --> 00:46:43,675
Uh, yeah.

582
00:46:44,874 --> 00:46:46,177
Watch him.

583
00:47:15,372 --> 00:47:16,972
You know if you give
the other half,

584
00:47:16,974 --> 00:47:19,041
we're as good as dead.

585
00:47:19,043 --> 00:47:21,410
I got a sniper
in the front woods.

586
00:47:21,412 --> 00:47:23,348
I'd like to take him out.

587
00:47:24,414 --> 00:47:26,213
Not yet, Pops.

588
00:47:26,215 --> 00:47:27,816
We gotta get Charlotte
out of here,

589
00:47:27,818 --> 00:47:29,785
then I'll come back for you.

590
00:47:29,787 --> 00:47:32,189
Until then, just wait.

591
00:47:34,291 --> 00:47:36,294
Roger that.

592
00:48:15,298 --> 00:48:17,332
Hi, baby. I got you.

593
00:48:17,334 --> 00:48:19,337
You're doing so good.
Come on.

594
00:48:21,238 --> 00:48:23,738
It's gonna be okay,
all right?

595
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:26,240
Soon Grandpa and I are gonna
need your help, all right?

596
00:48:26,242 --> 00:48:28,910
- I'm ready.
- That's my tough little girl.

597
00:48:28,912 --> 00:48:30,848
You stay right here.
I'll be right back.

598
00:48:33,751 --> 00:48:35,416
You still got 'em?

599
00:48:35,418 --> 00:48:37,051
POPS: Yeah, I do.

600
00:48:37,053 --> 00:48:39,256
Wait for my signal.

601
00:48:55,338 --> 00:48:57,338
Once we have
the other half secured,

602
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:58,506
take 'em all out.

603
00:48:58,508 --> 00:49:00,307
<i>Copy that.</i>

604
00:49:00,309 --> 00:49:01,712
Copy.

605
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:19,096
Yeah, yeah.

00:50:07,477 --> 00:50:09,376
Goddamn it. You with me.

612
00:50:09,378 --> 00:50:12,012
Lay down some cover.

- Nobody gets out of that cabin.

616
00:50:18,488 --> 00:50:20,187
- Go!
- Oh, hell no!

617
00:50:20,189 --> 00:50:21,159
Hey!

618
00:50:23,126 --> 00:50:24,258
Hey!

619
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:26,029
Hey, I need a fucking gun!

620

- Fuck.

622
00:51:18,048 --> 00:51:19,414
Charlotte,
you remember the plan?

623
00:51:19,416 --> 00:51:21,182
- Okay.
- Yeah?

624
00:51:21,184 --> 00:51:22,584
You get to the top,
you call Mama.

625
00:51:22,586 --> 00:51:24,519
- Yeah.
- I love you.

626
00:51:24,521 --> 00:51:26,053
Go.

627
00:51:26,055 --> 00:51:27,425
Run, run.

628
00:51:31,461 --> 00:51:33,296
Go!

629
00:52:29,418 --> 00:52:31,051
Stop.

630
00:52:31,053 --> 00:52:32,523
Kill the engine.

631
00:52:52,342 --> 00:52:55,412
[distant engine revving]

632
00:53:00,182 --> 00:53:02,383
Wait.

633
00:53:02,385 --> 00:53:07,454
The main road's that direction.
Why is he looping back around?

634
00:53:07,456 --> 00:53:09,323
- Ah...
- What's going on?

635
00:53:09,325 --> 00:53:13,164
He's not trying to run.
He's going back to the cabin.

636
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:17,765
I'm going uphill,
try to find a sniper position.

637
00:53:17,767 --> 00:53:19,970
You push him back towards me.

All right.

[distant engine idling]

648
00:56:09,972 --> 00:56:11,372
I got the bag.

KASSEN: <i>And where's Braven?</i>

650
00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:15,278
I'll find him.

00:56:33,997 --> 00:56:35,232

<i>Charlotte, you can't

663
00:58:03,052 --> 00:58:05,320
Stop. Mom, there are men
shooting at us.

00:58:05,322 --> 00:58:07,488

- <i>They're shooting.</i>

00:58:41,758 --> 00:58:44,024
There seems to be
some sort of trouble.

- Trouble?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

<i>Charlotte called and said
there were men shooting.</i>

Anyway, she lost reception.

What's going on?

694
00:59:08,818 --> 00:59:10,984
Shots fired over at
the Braven cabin. Let's go.

695
00:59:10,986 --> 00:59:12,787
Man, look,
it's probably just some kids

696
00:59:12,789 --> 00:59:16,560
who are shooting cans off
some fence posts or something.

697
00:59:42,184 --> 00:59:43,786
Fuck you, man.

00:59:55,164 --> 00:59:56,467
