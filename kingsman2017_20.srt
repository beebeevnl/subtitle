CLARA: Sorry we never
found your friends.

10
0:0:48.151 --> 0:0:50.353
Well, we all go on
our separate journeys...

11
0:0:50.387 --> 0:0:52.022
but, ultimately,
we'll all arrive

12
0:0:52.055 --> 0:0:53.623
at the same destination.

13
0:0:53.655 --> 0:0:56.691
Shall we check my tent?
See if they're there?

14
0:0:56.726 --> 0:0:58.996
Uh... Yeah.
Oh, come on.

15
0:1:4.066 --> 0:1:5.568
Wow.

16
0:1:5.601 --> 0:1:7.236
This is amazing.

17
0:1:8.872 --> 0:1:10.306
Come on.

18
0:1:10.340 --> 0:1:13.376
Uh, you know what, I'm busting
for a pee actually. (CHUCKLES)

19
0:1:13.409 --> 0:1:15.111
You could do it on me
if you want.

20
0:1:15.912 --> 0:1:17.014
Uh...

21
0:1:17.680 --> 0:1:19.015
Maybe in a bit.

22
0:1:19.749 --> 0:1:21.416
Give me a sec, yeah?

23
0:1:21.450 --> 0:1:23.954
Okay, but hurry up, River.

24
0:1:23.986 --> 0:1:26.956
Been waiting all night for you
to at least kiss me.

25
0:1:28.191 --> 0:1:29.593

Hey!

28
0:1:34.831 --> 0:1:37.800
EGGSY: Hi, babe.
Uh, bit of a nightmare.

29
0:1:37.834 --> 0:1:39.169
I've got to sleep
with a target...

30
0:1:39.202 --> 0:1:41.904
but I won't do it, unless
you agree that it's all right.

31
0:1:41.938 --> 0:1:44.474
You've got
to be fucking kidding.

32
0:1:44.506 --> 0:1:46.309
What was I, target practice?

33
0:1:46.342 --> 0:1:48.845
Babe, surely it's better that
I'm honest with you...

34
0:1:48.878 --> 0:1:50.579
rather than me doing it
and not telling you.

35
0:1:50.613 --> 0:1:53.448
Kind of got a bit of
a "save the world" situation here.

36
0:1:53.483 --> 0:1:55.352
How the fuck is screwing someone

37
0:1:55.385 --> 0:1:56.986
gonna save the world?

38
0:1:57.019 --> 0:1:58.921
Well, it's a bit complicated...

39
0:1:58.954 --> 0:2:1.891
but trust me, I would not be
doing it if I didn't have to.

40
0:2:5.028 --> 0:2:7.463
Babe, please believe me.
I love you.

41
0:2:7.497 --> 0:2:8.698
You are the person I wanna spend

42
0:2:8.731 --> 0:2:9.999
the rest of my life with.

43
0:2:12.068 --> 0:2:13.302
Is that a proposal?

44
0:2:15.371 --> 0:2:16.539
Um...

45
0:2:16.572 --> 0:2:18.407
Because I think I'd give you
my permission.

46
0:2:18.441 --> 0:2:22.245
Having that security, knowing
that we were committed...

47
0:2:22.278 --> 0:2:25.247
In that context, yeah.
Yeah, I'd feel different.

48
0:2:26.316 --> 0:2:28.285
Right. Well, I mean...

49
0:2:28.318 --> 0:2:29.452
I want to be with you,

50
0:2:29.485 --> 0:2:31.086
but being
a public figure, babe...

51
0:2:31.121 --> 0:2:32.356
like a prince...

52
0:2:33.356 --> 0:2:34.524
It's a bit of a factor,
you know,

53
0:2:34.557 --> 0:2:35.859
what with my job and stuff.

54
0:2:37.492 --> 0:2:39.662
Oh, no, no, no, come on. Okay.

55
0:2:39.695 --> 0:2:41.730
Uh, look, we need to talk
about this properly.

56
0:2:41.764 --> 0:2:43.866
Just give me five minutes, okay?

57
0:2:44.767 --> 0:2:47.470
Don't put yourself down, Eggsy.

58
0:2:47.503 --> 0:2:49.739
I'm sure you can last
longer than that.
