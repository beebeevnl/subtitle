1
0:0:1.425 --> 0:0:3.460
I opened our doomsday
scenario locker

2
0:0:3.494 --> 0:0:5.396
and that umbrella was in it.

3
0:0:5.429 --> 0:0:8.633
Kingsman.
It's got our logo on it.

4
0:0:10.099 --> 0:0:11.134
I'm really sorry.

5
0:0:11.168 --> 0:0:13.804
(LAUGHING) My apologies, boys.

6
0:0:13.836 --> 0:0:15.939
I hope there ain't
no hard feelings.

7
0:0:15.972 --> 0:0:17.007
I was just doin' my job.

8
0:0:18.108 --> 0:0:19.342
Welcome to the Statesman,

9
0:0:19.376 --> 0:0:21.544
independent intelligence agency.

10
0:0:21.579 --> 0:0:22.880
Just like y'all, I reckon.

11
0:0:22.912 --> 0:0:25.081
But our founders went
into the booze business.

12
0:0:25.115 --> 0:0:26.150
Thank the sweet Lord above.

13
0:0:26.985 --> 0:0:28.084
This is Ginger Ale.

14
0:0:28.117 --> 0:0:29.852
She's our strategy executive.

15
0:0:29.887 --> 0:0:30.889
Hello.

16
0:0:31.588 --> 0:0:33.757
I'm Agent Tequila.

17
0:0:33.791 --> 0:0:35.727
This is the part
where you untie us.

18
0:0:39.296 --> 0:0:40.598
MERLIN: Thank you.

19
0:0:46.871 --> 0:0:47.972
Harry.

20
0:0:48.006 --> 0:0:49.474
Hello.
Hello, mate.

21
0:0:54.311 --> 0:0:55.914
Harry.

22
0:0:55.947 --> 0:0:57.015
How do you do?

23
0:0:58.148 --> 0:0:59.950
Have we met before?

24
0:0:59.983 --> 0:1:4.387
Harry, it's okay. It's fine.
They know that we know you.

25
0:1:4.421 --> 0:1:6.823
I think there must be
some mistake.

26
0:1:6.856 --> 0:1:9.559
It's been such
a long time, Harry.

27
0:1:9.593 --> 0:1:12.730
I need to get
my brogues resoled.

28
0:1:12.762 --> 0:1:15.599
Yeah, and my oxfords
are done in as well.

29
0:1:15.633 --> 0:1:17.936
Why are you telling me
about your shoes?

30
0:1:23.072 --> 0:1:24.174
I'm a lepidopterist.

31
0:1:25.108 --> 0:1:26.409
You're a what?

32
0:1:26.443 --> 0:1:27.978
I study butterflies.

33
0:1:31.983 --> 0:1:35.519
MERLIN: Well, you wanted to be before
you joined the army, but...

34
0:1:37.454 --> 0:1:38.923
Harry, look at me.

35
0:1:45.496 --> 0:1:46.865
It's good to see you.

36
0:1:47.999 --> 0:1:49.066
We'll be back soon.

37
0:1:49.099 --> 0:1:52.135
So these fellas right here
are our doomsday protocol?

38
0:1:52.169 --> 0:1:55.539
Turns out, our founder's
tailor was Kingsman.

39
0:1:58.008 --> 0:1:59.343
What the fuck
have you done to him?

40
0:1:59.376 --> 0:2:1.645
Nothing. Only tried
to help him.

41
0:2:1.679 --> 0:2:2.979
He's got retrograde amnesia.

42
0:2:3.014 --> 0:2:4.247
Now, we knew from his eyeglasses

43
0:2:4.282 --> 0:2:5.314
that he was intelligence.

44
0:2:5.349 --> 0:2:6.584
We just didn't know whose.

45
0:2:7.684 --> 0:2:9.286
How did he get here?

46
0:2:10.555 --> 0:2:11.589
(ALARM BLARING)

47
0:2:11.622 --> 0:2:13.691
GINGER: What the hell?

48
0:2:13.724 --> 0:2:16.026
Tequila, I'm getting
a crazy spike...

49
0:2:16.059 --> 0:2:18.695
of extreme low frequency waves
11 miles from here.

50
0:2:18.729 --> 0:2:20.665
I'm gonna need you to
escort me there immediately.

51
0:2:48.691 --> 0:2:50.193
I need your alpha gel.

52
0:2:51.896 --> 0:2:53.731
TEQUILA: I'll go check the church.
