00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,965
<i>You might think life is easy</i>

2
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,327
<i>fora cute little squirrel
with</i> a <i>fluffy fail,</i>

3
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,561
<i>but it's not.</i>

4
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,729
<i>Sure, when kids see you
in the park, they go, “Aww!.”</i>

5
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,245
Aww!

6
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,085
<i>If you're lucky,
they give you nuts.</i>

7
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,924
<i>If you're unlucky,
they are nuts.</i>

8
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,650
<i>Being the little guy means
everything's out to get you.</i>

9
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,082
Bikes...

10
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,924
Cars...

11
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,725
Gum...
Ugh.

12
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,763
Ugh! Whoa!

13
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,968
<i>But things got a whole
lot better last summer</i>

14
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,247
<i>when the Nut Shop
went out o! business,</i>

15
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,483
<i>and left a lifetime supply
of food in the basement.</i>

16
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,889
<i>Fur once, the little guy at
the bottom of the food chain</i>

17
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,769
<i>came out on top.</i>

18
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,849
Cannonball!

19
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,963
You da man, Surly.

20
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,610
Ha-ha! Thank you.
Thank you.

21
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,762
I call that one
"The Peanut Buster,"

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,445
patent pending.

23
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,968
Excellent.
A very tight tuck.

24
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,566
And a high degree of difficulty.

25
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,648
I prefer a cleaner entry.

26
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,881
A little loo much flare.

27
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,488
Whoa, nice. 10.

28
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,166
Now, if you'll excuse me,

29
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,083
I gotta get back
to slacking off.

30
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,487
Looking good, Surly.
Yeah, whoo-hoo!

31
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,927
Hey, Bruce, remember
to pace yourself.

32
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,246
Why would I wanna do that'?

33
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,084
Playing with
your food? Nice.

34
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,241
Look out!

35
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,250
Oh! Slow down
or someone's gonna get hurt.

36
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,768
Yes. Wheel Yee-haw!

37
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,601
Ahh! Precious, come on. That's disgusting.
We talked about this.

38
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,011
No lick-licks.

39
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,684
Ah, sorry, boss.

40
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,330
It's hard to respect
your personal space

41
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,845
when you taste
like peanut butter.

42
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,082
There's a peanut butter
machine right there.

43
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,208
No way.
Peanut butter.

44
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,328
Come on, Daddy needs
a new pair of shoes.

45
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,649
What do you need shoes for?
You're a wild animal.

46
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,285
Come on, snake eyes.

47
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,966
One peanut-colada,
coming right up.

48
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,885
Keep 'em coming, Morty.

49
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,964
All right. Clear a path.
Mixed nuts coming through.

50
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,049
Stuff your face until it's pink.

51
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,724
How many peanuts can you drink'?

52
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,524
One. Two. Three. Four.

53
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,728
Get your popcorn here.
Hot, fresh popcorn.

54
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,167
The fun never stops
with the corn that pops.

55
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,483
Popcorn here.
Get your popcorn.

56
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,601
No fair. Mine didn't pop.

57
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,884
That was awesome!

58
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,327
This is the life, Buddy, huh?

59
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,880
Kickin' back,
literally doing nothing.

60
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,322
Remember when we had
to work for these things?

61
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,443
Come on, Dad.
Hurry up.

62
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,488
Careful, sweetheart.
Not too fast.

63
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,921
There it is.

64
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,447
With a little hard work
and determination,

65
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,170
that nut will be ours.

66
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,611
Uh, Andie, why don't
we just get free nuts

67
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,250
from the Nut Shop
like everyone else?

68
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,848
Does anybody else
think that's a good idea?

69
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,123
- Uh, yeah. Yeah, I do.
- Oh! Oh! Oh!

70
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,726
Yeah.
No. It's a terrible idea.

71
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,966
Oh.

72
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,280
Come on, guys.

73
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,842
We're wild animals. Living off
the Nut Shop is unnatural.

74
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,367
But their products
are 100% organic.

75
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,731
Now, who thinks
we should go get that nut?

76
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,040
Guys.

77
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,040
This is when you're supposed
to put your hands up.

78
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,764
- Right. Okay, Andie. Okay.
- Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

79
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,849
That's better.
Now, pay attention

80
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,410
because this will be
on the test.

81
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,882
Remember,
the nut is your friend.

82
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,406
It's been waiting
its whole life for this.

83
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,881
Place your hands
at 10:00 and 2:00

84
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,405
and gently pull.

85
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,563
Gently pull. Ahh!

86
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,927
Uh, Andie?
Will this be on the test?

87
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,242
Please hold all questions

88
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,403
until the end of the demonstration.

89
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,011
The Nut Shop's

90
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,605
looking better and better.
Mmm-hmm.

91
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,729
See, class?
Hard work always pays off.

92
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,402
Ooh!

93
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,249
- Ahh!
- Ooh!

94
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,321
See? That wasn't so bad.

95
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,442
Now we can squirrel that
nut away for the winter.

96
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,805
Who wants to go
to the Nut Shop'?

97
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,291
Nut Shop rules!

98
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,803
Johnny's got the early lead,
but Jimmy's close behind.

99
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,167
Official eating contest rules
are in full effect.

100
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,844
Any regurgitory reversals

101
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,167
will result in disqualification.

102
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,041
Yay!

103
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,767
Whoo-hoo! Yeah.

104
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,251
Here come the nuts.

105
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,646
Attaboy, Johnny. Show
those nuts who's boss.

106
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,650
Are you joking?
An eating contest?

107
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,365
What? It's good
for morale.

108
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,246
Surly! Hold that
cranky response.

109
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,526
I got you something.

110
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,642
A Brazil nut?
Yeah.

111
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,326
It's, uh, exotic.

112
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,687
I, uh, thought
you might like, uh...

113
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,882
That's really sweet. I...

114
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,408
I can't believe
you saved it for me.

115
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,005
But, you know, I...

116
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,003
I won't take food
from the Nut Shop.

117
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,242
Well, that was supposed
to play out differently.

118
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,320
Eat. Eat. Eat. Eat.

119
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,488
Living off the Nut Shop
was okay in the beginning,

120
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,050
but look at what it's become.

121
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,401
And Jimmy tries to take the lead

122
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,687
with his patented
hammerhead technique.

123
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,410
What a tremendous athlete.

124
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,848
Classic.

125
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,763
This is not what animals do.

126
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,526
We work hard, we store, we save.

127
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,606
Look at all of you. Lazy
and spoiled and fat.

128
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,162
Who you callin' fat?

129
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,770
Come back to the park, Surly.

130
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,604
It's where we belong.

131
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,726
That's my favorite thing
about being mayor.

132
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,048
You get to sign
your own permits.

133
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,885
Hear, hear.

134
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,048
Every square inch of this
city is generating profits.

135
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,488
How else could we skim enough
off the top to build ourselves

136
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,369
that private golf course?

137
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,487
Am I right, people?

138
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,403
Fore!

139
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,840
But I've got a thorn in my side.

140
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,450
One part of this city
puts nothing in my pocket.

141
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:03,563
Liberty Park.
Nothing but grass and trees

142
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,566
sitting on premium
city real estate.

143
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,483
Generates zero profit,

144
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,846
and I can't very well charge
children to climb trees, now can I?

145
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,127
I'll look into it, sir.
A dollar a climb?

146
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,725
No need.

147
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,922
I got bigger plans than trees.

148
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,000
Andie, come back.

149
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,606
Come on, what's with you?
Why are you so mad'?

150
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,842
The animals are losing
their instincts.

151
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,605
They' re not gathering or
storing anything for winter,

152
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,603
and they're not
working together.

153
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,131
Take it easy.

154
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,282
That's all anybody does
around here.

155
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,486
Take it easy.

156
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,131
<i>For she's</i> a <i>jofly good
eater! For she's</i> a <i>jolly good eater!</i>

157
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,765
What's wrong with easy?

158
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,202
Easy doesn't build character.

159
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,611
Easy doesn't last.

160
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,441
That's ridiculous.

161
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,607
Look at 'em. Working together,
building character.

162
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,768
Morale is
at an all-time high.

163
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,330
You gotta get with
the program, Andie.

164
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,291
It's a house of cards, Surly,
and it's only a matter of time

165
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,290
till it comes crashing down.
Relax.

166
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,001
It's not like the Nut
Shop's gonna explode.

167
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,968
Oh, no! The peanut butter
machine was in there.

168
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,129
Oh, I can still
taste you on my lips.

169
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,962
No.
Oh, dear.

170
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,843
Mole, you had one job.

171
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,447
What was that again?

172
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,645
Shut off the boiler,
so it doesn't explode.

173
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,845
It's not my fault.
I told Jimmy to do it.

174
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,571
I told Johnny to do it.

175
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,971
I told Jamie to do it.

176
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,605
And I told Mole to do it.

177
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,929
Oh, right. It is my fault.

178
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,681
What are we going to do, Surly?

179
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,848
Yeah. What are
we gonna do?

180
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,809
Where we gonna get food?

181
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,205
It's okay.
It's okay. We'll be fine.

182
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,203
We'll just go back
to scrounging and gathering

183
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,611
like nature intended.

184
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,887
This will be a good thing. What?

185
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,127
You think the Nut Shop
blowing up is a good thing?

186
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,645
Well, I got news for you.

187
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,200
Nobody's gonna gather.
Nobody's gonna scrounge.

188
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,125
Nobody's gonna break their back

189
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,282
collecting dirty,
old, stale acorns.

190
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,044
Sit down, put your feet up,

191
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,521
and Surly'll take care
of everything.

192
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,011
It's over, Surly.

193
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,401
Things can't go back
to the way they were.

194
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,410
I'll find a new place even
better than the Nut Shop.

195
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,090
Like a nut market.

196
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,645
Or a nut emporium.

197
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,041
In fact, why limit
ourselves to nuts?

198
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,090
This city's got everything.
Popcorn. Donuts.

199
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,164
Hot dog on a stick.

200
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,244
Hot dog on a stick? Yeah!

201
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,686
I love hot dogs.

202
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,091
I love sticks.

203
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,163
What do you say, Buddy?
You in?

204
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,651
You can do it, Surly.

205
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,161
Bring us back a smorgasbord.

206
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,164
Hot dog on a stick!
Hot dog on a stick!

207
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,607
There are no
shortcuts in life, Surly.

208
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,202
Oh, really?
Come on, Buddy.

209
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,165
Let's take the shortcut.

210
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,891
When we find food,
Andie's gonna be all like...

211
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,888
"Oh, Surly,
you were right all along.

212
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,088
"And I was wrong
all along."

213
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,644
Please, Andie,
don't beat yourself up about it.

214
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,760
"Oh, Surly,
you're so wise and forgiving

215
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,962
"and kind
and nice and furry."

216
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,930
Shh.

217
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,401
Don't worry, Andie.
I forgive you.

218
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,449
Huh?

219
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,127
Jackpot.

220
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,164
Or should I say, le jackpot.

221
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,842
Oh, baby, you gotta
try this escargot.

222
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,162
Oh! That's good.

223
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,251
Rats!

224
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,560
Move it, Buddy!
Let's go!

225
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,000
Get out of my restaurant,
you disgusting rodents!

226
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,721
Jackpot.

227
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,963
Salty, overpriced,
snack food jackpot.

228
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,481
Come on.

229
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,161
Thank you, popcorn.

230
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,251
Oh...

231
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,126
Yes. Buddy, look.
One left.

232
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,604
Oh, come on!

233
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,970
<i>All units,
we have a Code 7 in progress.</i>

234
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,560
<i>It's half-priced donuts,
people. Get moving!</i>

235
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,125
Dibs on the jelly.
Get in there, get in there.

236
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,049
Jackpot

237
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,647
Deep-fried, honey-glazed,
artery-clogging jackpot.

238
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,488
Not the donut!
Not the donut!

239
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,441
Wow!

240
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,000
Those guys are serious
about donuts.

241
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,761
Ah, let's face it.

242
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,569
There's no food for us out here.

243
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,170
Let's go back to the park.

244
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,561
This is our stop.

245
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,211
Pay attention.
Timing is everything.

246
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,767
One, two, three.

247
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,282
I forgot to account
for the mailbox.

248
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,763
Everyone is gonna
expect us to have food,

249
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,247
so we're gonna need to let
them down easy. Got it?

250
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,763
All right.
Follow my lead.

251
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,281
Oh!

252
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,203
Hey, Surly's back.
Come on.

253
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,520
Yay. Surly.

254
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,443
Surly!
Surly, Yeah!

255
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,726
Did you find food?

256
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,526
Uh...

257
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,011
They found food.

258
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,322
What Buddy means
is we found food,

259
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,811
but it's complicated.

260
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,690
Did you find popcorn?

261
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,400
Buddy!

262
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,851
Did you find donuts?

263
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,967
Here's the thing...

264
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,841
How many donuts?

265
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,126
Everybody hold on!

266
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,520
Eight donuts?

267
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,883
There is no food!

268
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,602
We're all gonna die!

269
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,130
Everybody calm down.

270
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,006
Calm down!

271
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,240
Thank you.

272
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,368
Come on, guys.
Look around.

273
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,245
We're the luckiest animals
in the world.

274
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,087
Our park has everything we need.

275
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,531
<i>This park's our home</i>

276
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,241
What are you doing?

277
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,561
Singing. It felt like
the right thing to do.

278
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,921
When's the last time
you saw somebody

279
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,490
spontaneously break into song'?

280
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,244
Oh, come on.
They were into it.

281
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,005
It was a little awkward.

282
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,491
You're not a great singer.

283
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,688
Honestly, it was kind of pitchy.

284
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,004
Jeez. Tough crowd.

285
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,169
We all love the park,
but please...

286
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,731
Please, never do that again.

287
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,920
One question!
One question!

288
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,604
Ladies and gentlemen
of the press,

289
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,569
welcome to Liberty Park.

290
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,005
I think we can all agree
this boring old park

291
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,283
needs a shot in the arm.
Behold!

292
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,410
Libertyland!

293
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,682
The greatest place on Earth!

294
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,844
Who wants a regular park

295
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,760
when you can have
an amusement park'?

296
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,168
It's more fun,
more rides, more games,

297
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,491
and more profit.

298
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,724
Libertyland is
my greatest creation.

299
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,446
You told me I was
your greatest creation.

300
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,764
No, no. Of course
you are, sweetheart.

301
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,401
No, Libertyland is
my second-greatest creation.

302
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,688
No, no, no.
This is all wrong.

303
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,809
I want the Tilt-A-Whirl
here, bumper cars here,

304
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,086
and cotton candy

305
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,403
here, here, here,
here, here, and here.

306
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,331
That's a lot of
cotton candy now, snookums.

307
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,840
We don't want
your teeth to fall out.

308
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,640
But I want it!

309
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,200
Okay. She wants her teeth
to fall out, let's do it.

310
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,402
Can we get some more
cotton candy in here, please?

311
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,244
Yes, sir.
Now!

312
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,485
This doesn't look good.

313
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,846
Why don't you sing
a song about it?

314
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,287
Mr. Mayor, over here.
Mr. Mayor. Mr. Mayor,

315
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,727
what's going to happen
to the animals in the park?

316
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,161
Ah, nobody cares about
these animals.

317
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,049
Nobody cares more than me.

318
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,930
Look, don't you worry.
I will take care of them.

319
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,561
I will make sure
they're all taken care of.

320
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,522
And without further ado,

321
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,762
let the groundbreaking begin!

322
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,441
Look at that sign.

323
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,971
They're gonna destroy the park.

324
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,765
We're all gonna die!

325
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,490
Calm down. It's a fat guy
with a tiny shovel.

326
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,005
How much damage can he do?

327
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,125
Oh, I get it.

328
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,964
The tiny shovel was
a symbolic gesture.

329
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,686
Oh, no.

330
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,169
Run!

331
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,802
Well, my work here is done.

332
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,641
You see, sweetheart?

333
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,927
I make the speech,
they do the work.

334
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,371
Whew!

335
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,761
Abandon park!

336
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,410
Hey, where's everyone going?

337
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,002
Wait up. Andie.

338
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,361
Andie!

339
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,324
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, slow down.
Who put you in charge?

340
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,923
This isn't about
who's in charge, Surly.

341
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,490
It's about keeping us safe.

342
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,007
Are you saying
I can't keep us safe?

343
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,884
You had your chance
to take care of the group,

344
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,086
and you blew it.

345
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,004
Instead of doing what was
right, you did what was easy.

346
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,651
Ooh!

347
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,929
Easy? Huh! Look at you.
You're running away.

348
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,525
What could be easier than that?

349
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,409
Oh, I'm sorry. What do
you think we should do?

350
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,481
We, uh...

351
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,367
We fight!

352
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,971
Fight the humans?

353
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,168
We're all gonna die!

354
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:23,685
Tiny animals do not fight
humans with giant machines.

355
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,047
If you wanna tuck tail
and run, go ahead,

356
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,124
but I'm staying here.

357
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,442
This park belongs to us,

358
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,643
and I think it's worth
fighting for.

359
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,122
Let's go get 'em.
Who's with me?

360
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,486
We're with you, Surly.

361
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,050
Heck, yes, we are. Huh!

362
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,961
Please, Surly. Think about
what you're saying.

363
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,087
For the park!

364
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,488
Let me show you guys
how it's done.

365
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,811
In the name of the park,

366
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,884
I order you to stop your vehicle and...

367
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,208
So much for peaceful protest.

368
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,282
Let's see you drive
without this.

369
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,045
Whoa, Surly.

370
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,201
That was awesome.

371
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,361
YOU Okay?

372
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,924
I'm good, but you
guys get the next one.

373
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,687
So I told the foreman, my head's
so thick I don't need a hard hat.

374
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,004
Get it off! Get it off!

375
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,043
Dig, dig, dig, dig,
dig, dig, dig, dig, dig-

376
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,770
Whoa!

377
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,882
Hey! Hold on,
I'll be done in a second.

378
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,401
Whoa! MOUSE: Don't
forget to flush. Ha!

379
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,168
Let's trash this place.

380
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,281
Whoa!

381
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,651
I'm de-filing this thing.

382
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,688
This is what I call
a number three.

383
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,811
Whoa! Whoa!

384
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,281
Hey, look what I found.
Hut, hut, hut!

385
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,882
Whoa! It's good!

386
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,361
I wonder what this thing does'?
Whoa! Whoa!

387
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,801
Whoa! Oh! Whoa!

388
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,243
Ow! Ow! Whoa!

389
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,051
Ahh! You guys
gotta try this thing.

390
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,366
Trailer trash. Ha!

391
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,042
Nobody cuts down
a tree in my park.

392
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,641
Fire!

393
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,770
I may not be aerodynamic,

394
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,649
but I'm an excellent projectile.

395
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,169
Ha! Now we've both got
a squished-in face.

396
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,047
One left.

397
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,121
You ready, Buddy?

398
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,885
Go! Go! Go! Go!

399
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,284
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

400
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,603
Back in the hive! No, no, no!
Ow! Ow! No, no, no!

401
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,966
Ahh!

402
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,326
Huh?

403
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,129
Nice work, Buddy.

404
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,931
We took a lot of stings
for the team on that one.

405
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,764
How did you not get stung?

406
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,881
You better run!

407
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,611
I'm off-leash,
on a rampage!

408
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,529
Hello?

409
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,524
Yep, this is he. Yes, I
received your bribe.

410
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,609
On, did <i>I</i> say bribe?

411
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,490
Why, I meant
"campaign contribution."

412
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,167
Gotta go.

413
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,121
Come in.

414
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,849
Um...
Mr. Mayor...

415
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,968
Well, look who it is.

416
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,165
How nice of you to
take time out of your busy day

417
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,765
to come down here
and let me know

418
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,571
that construction
is right on schedule.

419
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,241
Actually, sir,
that's not why I'm here.

420
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,169
Well, then you must
be here to tell me

421
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,766
that we're ahead of schedule.
Uh...

422
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,449
'Cause I know you ain't here to
tell me that we have fallen behind!

423
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,841
Sir, we were overrun by animals.

424
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,248
They threw our potty
in the river.

425
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:37,369
Libertyland will proceed
according to plan!

426
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,963
Ooh, some mangy little rodents
think they can stop me?

427
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,570
Well, I'll show them

428
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,531
what happens when you mess
with Percival J. Muldoon!

429
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,089
Oh, yes, I will.

430
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,843
Oh, yes. I will.

431
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,810
Way to go, Surly!

432
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,326
You saved the park.
You did it, Surly.

433
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:10,366
Let's just say that bulldozer wrote
a check its scoop couldn't cash.

434
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,130
Ugh! Stop that.
We talked about this.

435
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,562
Oh, come on.
We're celebrating.

436
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,566
Fine. One more lick,
then you're cut off.

437
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,963
Ooh! Thanks, boss.
I'm gonna make it count.

438
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,770
Ooh, yeah,
it's gonna be a good one.

439
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,484
It's gonna be a good one.

440
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,324
Whoa. Whoa.

441
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,880
Whoa. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

442
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,167
Wow. That was intense.

443
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,091
Oh, you taste good today.

444
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,891
Stale acorns with
just a hint of bulldozer.

445
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,851
Way to go, everyone.
We did it.

446
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,166
I know everyone is hungry,

447
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,722
so I brought you all
a little surprise. Ta-da!

448
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,007
It's all the nuts
I was saving for winter.

449
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,010
- Ew!
- Yuck!

450
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,687
Not exactly what I'd call
"fine dining."

451
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,804
Oh, come on, Surly.
Have one.

452
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,445
We're all in this together.

453
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,245
Where'd you get this thing?

454
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,810
The bottom of a vacuum bag'?

455
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,964
Delicious.

456
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,249
More like
dust-licious.

457
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,921
Hey.

458
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,371
Hey, what the...

459
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,568
See? There's life
after the Nut Shop.

460
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,686
Hmm.

461
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,931
Oh, don't be like that.

462
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,730
Hey. There you are.

463
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,205
I never got a chance to say
you were amazing today.

464
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,646
I'm always amazing.

465
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,604
Today, you just happened
to notice.

466
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,211
I'm serious.

467
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,886
I didn't think we stood a chance
against those bulldozers,

468
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,849
but when you pulled
everyone together,

469
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,888
we were unstoppable.

470
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,727
Well, don't get used to it.
It was a one-time thing.

471
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,680
Today was a good day.

472
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,240
Why are you so intent
on being grumpy?

473
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,451
Are you happy it's gone?

474
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,008
Surly...
Answer the question.

475
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:18,641
I'm glad we're all living
together in the park again, yes.

476
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,601
Even if we starve?

477
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,604
We're not gonna starve.
Quit being so dramatic.

478
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,605
Animals did just fine
before there were nut shops.

479
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,409
Well, sorry if I'm not <i>as</i>
excited about it as you are.

480
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,250
It would be nice
if you could be.

481
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,560
Excited?
Yes.

482
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,564
About scrounging
for dusty old nuts? Ha!

483
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,043
The animals look up to you, Surly.
You need to set an example.

484
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,330
And what do you expect me to do?

485
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,882
You could start by
getting up at sunrise.

486
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,889
Get a head start
on the scrounging.

487
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,884
The animals will wake up and see
you working hard and think,

488
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,485
"I should work hard, too."

489
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,847
I'm gonna have
to give that a hard pass.

490
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,731
I'm sleeping in.

491
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,131
Well, you know what they say.

492
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,288
The early squirrel gets the nut.

493
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,607
That's not even a thing.

494
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:04,924
You just replaced "bird" with
"squirrel," and "worm" with "nut."

495
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,163
Well, it doesn't make it
any less true.

496
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,561
Good night, Andie.

497
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,805
Rise and shine, people.

498
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,730
Today is going to be
a great day.

499
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,849
Ugh! I think I'm having
a nightmare.

500
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,328
Up you get.
Clap your hands.

501
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,683
Today is the first day
of the rest of your life.

502
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,203
But what does
that make yesterday'?

503
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,768
Hey, Precious, wake up.

504
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,888
She's still sleeping. Ahh!

505
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,371
Hey, Andie! I'm starving!
What's for breakfast?

506
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,441
Whatever you want.

507
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,363
As long as you
gather it yourself.

508
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,130
Are you kidding me?

509
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:02,369
Please, Andie, stop.
Quit while you're behind.

510
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,122
Why lounge around when
you can scrounge around

511
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,282
for some nuts on the ground'?

512
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,166
Take your rhymes
somewhere else, sister.

513
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,925
You're right.
You should hang back.

514
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,642
Wouldn't want everybody to see that
Surly Squirrel has lost his instincts.

515
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,968
Hmm!

516
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,451
Try and keep up.

517
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,967
Nuts.

518
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,840
That's strange.
Where did those come from?

519
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,491
No instincts, huh?
How do you explain this?

520
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,081
Surly!

521
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,685
Well, this is embarrassing.

522
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,843
Surly's trapped, come on!

523
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,929
Pull!

524
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,843
We're all gonna die!

525
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,241
More specifically,
you're gonna die.

526
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,806
Way to keep it positive.

527
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,166
Get me out of here!

528
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,761
Pull!

529
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,251
It won't open!
It won't open!

530
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,683
Mr. Mayor, you have called
the right man for the job.

531
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,764
You'll be back to building your
amusement park in no time.

532
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,366
Let me demonstrate.

533
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,329
The little squirrel
having a nice day.

534
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,562
He sees a nut.
"Hello there, nut!"

535
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,327
Cage closes,
we drive him to the forest,

536
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,846
let him go, good as new.

537
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,929
I see. And this won't hurt
the animals?

538
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,129
Oh, no, Mr. Mayor!
Humane traps only.

539
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,009
Nobody's hurt,
everybody's happy.

540
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,964
Well, may I?
Of course.

541
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,170
I don't want humane!

542
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,326
I want painful,
gruesome termination!

543
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:42,003
Mr. Mayor, that is
a horrible and twisted way

544
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,128
to deal with the animals.

545
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,403
Daddy, I can help.

546
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,720
I'm good at shooting cute,
little, defenseless creatures.

547
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,920
Oh, sweetheart.
Daddy is so proud of you.

548
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,368
Oh, look. We got one.

549
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,886
Go get him, Frankie!

550
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,484
Go, Frankie, go!

551
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,007
On three,
everyone pull together.

552
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,726
One, two, three!

553
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,202
You okay?
I'm fine.

554
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,527
I... I'm fine. Bright-eyed
and bushy-tailed.

555
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,848
You had me worried there
for a second.

556
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,201
Wait. What's that sound?

557
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,243
It's probably the little
paranoid voice in your head

558
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,163
screaming at the top
of its lungs again.

559
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,526
I'm serious.

560
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,840
You certainly are.

561
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,721
You know, you're not <i>as</i>
funny as you think you are.

562
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,523
Dog! Run!

563
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,843
Dog!

564
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,246
Precious! Help!

565
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,726
Ahh!

566
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,929
Okay, someone's gonna
pay for that.

567
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,731
Whoa.

568
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,370
Why is he lookin'
at me like that?

569
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,725
What a beauty!

570
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:17,203
That smooshed-in face,
those bulging eyes.

571
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,080
She's like an angel.

572
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,241
Just go with it.

573
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,364
What? No, gross.

574
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,520
You gotta go talk to him,

575
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,568
or that mutt is gonna
rip us apart.

576
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,846
Ah...

577
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,964
You owe me big time.

578
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,565
Hey, there, handsome.

579
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,441
Hey, there, precious.

580
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,164
What? How do you know
my name?

581
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,364
Wait, your name
is actually Precious'?

582
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,602
Whoa. My name's Frankie.

583
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,205
It's long for Frank.

584
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,091
Oh, hey, I just had the most
unbelievable thought.

585
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,007
I'm Frankie, you're Precious.

586
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,646
That makes us, Frecious.

587
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,248
Keep him occupied. Try
using your feminine charm.

588
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,090
This is my feminine charm!

589
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,442
So, uh, tell me more about you.

590
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,006
What do you do for fun?

591
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,527
I would be more
than happy to show you.

592
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,766
Come here, you.

593
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,530
Come back here.
Get going.

594
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,641
I can't look away.

595
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,961
This guy is dumber than a bowling
ball with a face painted on it.

596
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,411
I'm gonna get you.
Oh! Oh! Oh!

597
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,721
This is the greatest thing
I've ever seen.

598
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,720
Gotcha!

599
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,800
Frankie's got a girlfriend.

600
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,486
Daddy, I got a new dog.

601
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,762
My little prince met a princess.

602
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,764
Surly!
Precious!

603
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:50,241
I'm coming for you, Precious!
Hang in there!

604
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,291
Ha-ha! Come on, boys!
Tonight we dine on squirrels!

605
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,520
Over the...

606
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,444
Guys in the...
Slow down.

607
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,601
What are you saying?

608
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,330
Uh...
We're all gonna die!

609
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,761
Oh, no! Everybody scatter!

610
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,161
My Egg!

611
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,482
No one's gettin' scrambled
on my watch.

612
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,726
Oh, thank you.

613
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,245
Come on, let's get out of here.

614
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,008
Everybody out.
We gotta go.

615
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,609
Leave it.
There's no time.

616
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,851
Guys, wait up!

617
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,731
Get back here,
you chubby little beast!

618
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:58,202
Come on, tiny legs!
Go faster!

619
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,728
This is so much fun! Whoo!

620
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,291
Whoa!

621
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,084
On!

622
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,971
Ow! My fingers!

623
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,645
And stay out!

624
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,724
You're gonna pay for this!

625
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,521
Fire in the hole.

626
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,606
That's not good.

627
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,084
Ah!

628
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,921
Huh?

629
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,371
I'd say we got him.

630
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,601
Smile.

631
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,529
You've completely
destroyed this park.

632
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,207
And I must say,
I am a fan of your work.

633
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:54,291
All right,
you layabouts, get moving!

634
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,965
Buckle up, sweetheart.

635
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,407
You know Daddy's got
a lead foot.

636
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,482
Precious!
Surly!

637
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,086
We gotta rescue Precious.

638
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,561
It's my fault she was
taken by that crazy kid.

639
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,563
Okay. You and Buddy
go after Precious.

640
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,842
I'll find us
a new place to live.

641
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,564
What?
Look around, Surly.

642
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,608
It's over.
We have to leave the park.

643
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,046
Where are we gonna go'?

644
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,248
There's another park
on the other side of town.

645
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,680
We'll check it out
and report back.

646
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,485
What about the rest of us?
What should we do?

647
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,964
You have the most important
job of all, little guy.

648
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,169
Try to not get killed.

649
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,881
I'll try, but I can't make
any promises.

650
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,843
Okay, let's get moving.

651
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,927
Hey.

652
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,525
Be careful out there.

653
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,569
Yeah. You too.

654
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,360
What're you
waitin' for? Move!

655
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,209
Out of the way, riffraff!

656
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,729
Well, I don't have time
for traffic.

657
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,166
Whee!

658
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,526
Get a license plate?

659
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,809
Whoa!

660
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,965
Faster, Daddy. Go faster.

661
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,451
Slow down.

662
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,404
I know this relationship
is moving fast,

663
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,045
but when it's right, it's right.

664
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,806
No! Slow down the car!

665
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,204
Where'd you learn to drive?

666
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,049
I voted for you.

667
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,887
Very nice to meet you.
Have a good day. Bye-bye.

668
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,202
Whoa!

669
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,041
Oh!

670
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,482
Oof! Ow! Come on, man.

671
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,691
Silly doggy.
Your new home is this way.

672
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,008
Help!
I'm not a rescue!

673
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,082
I need to be rescued!

674
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,370
Run, doggies, run!

675
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,202
Oh! Ow!
Whoa!

676
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,521
Are you okay?

677
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,682
Your owner is deranged.
Yeah.

678
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,603
She's got a screw loose,
that's for sure.

679
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,007
Who wants to eat today?

680
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,209
Oh, come on.
She's gonna feed us.

681
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,170
I make it a rule to never
take food from psychos.

682
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,485
But I'm starving.

683
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,526
Frankie, sit!

684
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,805
Stand on your hind legs!

685
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,966
Stand on one foot!

686
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,689
What are you, a circus dog?

687
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,286
I could be. You got a
thing for circus dogs?

688
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,811
Play dead!

689
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:44,050
Ah! Ah! I'm hit. I'm hit.
Ah! Oh!

690
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,884
Ah! You got me. Ooh!

691
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,964
Ah! You got me.

692
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,290
Man, that is dark.

693
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,124
Good boy.

694
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,529
Life is easy when you do
exactly what you're told.

695
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,010
Now, it's your turn.

696
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,607
Roll over.

697
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,488
I said, "roll over!"

698
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,760
What are you doin'?
Roll over!

699
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,201
L don't know how.
I'm not classically trained.

700
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,049
Oh, boy.
This ain't gonna be good.

701
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:17,091
You better learn
to do some tricks,

702
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,367
or you're gonna be hungry!

703
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,211
We've gotta find the mayor's
house and get Precious back.

704
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,684
Who you wavin' to?

705
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,691
Oh.

706
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,122
No time to make
new friends, Buddy.

707
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,449
Come on. This looks
like a shortcut.

708
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,200
Oh, don't tell me you're scared.

709
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,690
Everyone knows there's nothing
safer than a dark alley.

710
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,486
Come on. Ahh!

711
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:57,326
Just a lovable
little dolly. Oh!

712
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,211
Well, that's shoddy workmanship.

713
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,728
Dead end. Oh, no.

714
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,804
This is bad.
I'm too young to die.

715
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,123
I'm too furry to die.

716
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,483
It's been nice
knowing you, Buddy.

717
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,526
Oh, phew!

718
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,001
I thought we were in real
trouble there for a second.

719
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,566
You scared us,
you cute little guy.

720
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,641
Boop.

721
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,522
I shouldn't have booped
his cute little nose.

722
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,404
Don't call me cute!

723
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,571
The boop was too much.

724
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:49,241
This is my city.
You are on my turf.

725
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,370
How can someone
so cute be so violent?

726
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,966
Ow!

727
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:57,011
<i>I said,</i> don't call me cute!

728
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,721
Got it.

729
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,889
My name is Mr. Feng.

730
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,443
I was cursed with these big, adorable
eyes, and this fuzzy little body,

731
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,170
but make no mistake...

732
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,171
I'm a weapon
of mouse destruction.

733
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:14,961
Witness the power of my
one-sixteenth-of-an-inch punch.

734
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,090
Aw, that's cute.

735
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,204
And painfully efficient.

736
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,411
The city is no place
for park animals.

737
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,088
My army is unstoppable,

738
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,889
each mouse more deadly
than the last.

739
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,609
If you're telling me
that the first mouse

740
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,365
is the least deadly,
I'd like to speak with him.

741
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,485
Any last words?

742
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,003
Yeah, just one.

743
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,401
Cat!

744
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,720
Huh?

745
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,006
Everybody run!

746
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,605
Come on, Buddy!

747
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,806
There's no cat.

748
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,201
Get them!

749
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,442
You were right!
No more dark alleys!

750
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,441
Oof!

751
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,800
Taxi!

752
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,004
No! Buddy!

753
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,050
- Run!
- Get the rat!

754
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,284
Give me your hand, Buddy.
I got you.

755
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,011
Come on, jump!

756
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,203
If you ever come
back to the city, you're dead!

757
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,126
See you later,
you cutie patootie!

758
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,330
Wow, that sounded tougher
in my head.

759
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,646
Hurry up. The new park
is right over that wall.

760
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,205
What is taking them so long?

761
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,567
Come on!

762
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,206
Whoa, whoa. We were just doing
what the sign said. Oh, oh!

763
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,007
It's as pretty as a picture.

764
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,924
A picture of a beautiful park.

765
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,122
It's perfect.

766
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,804
Yeah, you're right.

767
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,201
It's not bad.

768
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,568
Whoa!

769
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,847
Out of my way!
No way! Me first!

770
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,485
How good is this?

771
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,569
And we've got the place
to ourselves.

772
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,324
Hello?

773
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,970
Everyone's gonna love it.

774
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:22,004
Mole can dig a new hole
right over there.

775
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,970
The chipmunks can live
in that beautiful old tree.

776
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:29,290
Gradually hollowing it out
until it stops living.

777
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,971
This park has
everything we need.

778
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,562
<i>This</i> park's our home

779
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,723
What is it?
Beats me.

780
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,851
Looks delicious.

781
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,081
It's stuck.

782
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,730
Get it out! Get it out!

783
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,730
At this point, I'm tempted
to let natural selection

784
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,450
take its course.
Get it out!

785
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,888
That thing stole my ball!

786
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,405
You gotta play it <i>as</i> it lays!

787
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,567
That's a stroke!

788
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,691
That's a stroke! I'm
counting all these, Barry!

789
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,721
Spit that thing out.

790
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,047
I'm trying!
I'm trying!

791
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,167
Look out!

792
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,171
It came out.

793
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,324
Run that thing over!

794
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,442
Look out!

795
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,890
Whoa!

796
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,040
Nice park, Andie!
This place is great!

797
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,291
Buddy, look.
It's the mayor's car.

798
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,607
Hang on, Precious. We're
coming for you.

799
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,243
Mailbox.
Good lookin' out, Buddy.

800
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,484
So many mailboxes.

801
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,680
Come on down, Buddy.

802
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,722
I got you.

803
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,609
Were you aiming for my face'?

804
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:27,205
This is gonna be
a stealth mission, so shh!

805
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,204
Don't say a word.

806
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,730
That shouldn't be
a problem for you.

807
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,405
Okay, that's a little creepy.

808
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,731
Buddy, check this out.

809
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,961
I call that one
"The Flying Squirrel."

810
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,322
Oh, I'm gonna kill you!

811
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,728
You kept me on hold
for 10 minutes!

812
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,084
Anyhoo, the roller coaster
was delivered today.

813
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:24,403
We got a great deal on a
used one that was condemned.

814
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,608
Ah, safety, shmafety. I want
profitability.

815
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,804
My name's Emma,
and this is my sister Maddie.

816
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,564
Can we come in and play?

817
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,529
No way! You have no bodies!

818
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,849
Our castle is
for body-people only.

819
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:43,921
Fine.

820
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,083
We'll use our piranha teeth
and chew our way in.

821
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,282
So this is what they mean when they
say, "There were warning signs-"

822
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,285
Yeah. You sleep better
if you don't watch.

823
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,643
Hey, what's wrong?
You hungry, babe'?

824
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,163
Starving. ls she ever
gonna feed me?

825
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:06,083
Hard to say, but don't worry.
Frankie's got you covered.

826
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,321
Dinner is served.

827
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:16,205
You want me to eat your barf?
That is revolting!

828
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,370
Revolting? Nah, girl.
Regurgitation.

829
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:20,920
There's a big difference.

830
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,930
Whatever it's called,
it looks nasty. Hmm.

831
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:27,488
Sorry, sweetie. I was just
trying to do something nice.

832
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,682
I didn't mean
to gross you out or nothin'.

833
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,487
Hmm. No sense in
lettin' this go to waste.

834
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,449
Oh, no!

835
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,007
Well, no sense lettin'
that go to waste either.

836
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,886
It's amazing how quickly
rock bottom sneaks up on you.

837
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,164
Psst! Precious.

838
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,007
What are you, vegan?
This has no taste.

839
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:49,210
Hey, Frankie,
what's that behind you?

840
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,441
Huh?

841
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,160
You wanna see me
catch it, don't you?

842
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,169
Hey, get back here.
Get back here, you.

843
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,971
Help. Help.
They're eating everyone.

844
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,484
I'm gonna get you.
I'm gonna get you.

845
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:00,686
I'm gonna get you.

846
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,842
Oh, oh, oh, oh! This ain't
gonna be good for you.

847
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:03,967
This ain't gonna be good for you.
Shh!

848
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,087
I'm gonna catch you.

849
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,606
I'm gonna catch you.
Come on. Get back here.

850
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,684
Come on. Get back here.

851
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,166
Hey!
What's going on?

852
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,008
Sorry, Frankie.
You're not really my type.

853
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,847
I was just pretending to
like you to save my friends.

854
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,125
Pretending?

855
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:26,011
But together, we're Frecious.

856
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,604
Come on.

857
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:37,607
Hop on!

858
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,127
Come on, move it!

859
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,201
I'm a pug.

860
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:43,124
I'm not built for speed.
Or power, or looks.

861
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,531
She's shootin' at us!

862
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,209
Giddy up! Yee-haw!
Ride, ride, ride!

863
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,204
Stop kickin' me!
I'm not a horse!

864
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,490
Good idea, Buddy.
Watch the rear.

865
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,046
When I catch you,

866
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,400
your heads are
going on the wall!

867
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,365
I don't think
that's an empty threat!

868
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,204
Hang on!

869
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:09,521
This is the worst rescue
of all time!

870
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:10,726
Daddy!

871
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,401
What's all this ruckus?

872
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,091
Hey, now! Ahh!

873
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,041
Whoa!

874
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:19,521
Gotcha!

875
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,682
Stop, stop!
Throw this puppy in reverse!

876
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,047
Get back here!

877
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,281
Bottoms up!

878
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,600
- Toodle-oo!
- No!

879
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:29,806
Yee-haw!

880
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,771
Ow!

881
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,481
Daddy, they're getting away!

882
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:37,285
Hold up.
There's something I gotta do.

883
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,124
Come on, we gotta go.

884
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:41,770
Buddy, you worry too much.

885
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:46,281
Well, well, well.
We meet again.

886
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,728
Little Mayor!

887
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:53,923
It's squirrel season.

888
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:56,647
Wha...

889
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,246
- Ha! ls that all you got?
- Buddy.

890
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:03,886
Buddy, no!

891
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,161
You got one.

892
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,208
Buddy!
No!

893
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,445
And stay out!

894
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,291
Andie...

895
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:35,925
<i>It's</i> Buddy.

896
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,681
Oh, no. What happened?

897
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,170
He's hurt real bad.

898
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,523
Here, let me help you.

899
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,047
Oh, his chest is movin'.
That means he's breathin'.

900
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,531
That's gotta be good, right?

901
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,649
It's all my fault.

902
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:02,246
If I hadn't been so reckless,
he'd still be okay.

903
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,885
Let me get this straight.

904
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,325
Liberty Park is destroyed,

905
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:15,689
the backup park was a bust,
and now Buddy's hurt too'?

906
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,729
Yes, yes, and yes.

907
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:20,124
Wow, I'm never right.

908
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,850
Now it happens
three times in a row,

909
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,524
and I'm not even happy about it.

910
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,122
Hey, Buddy, remember when we...

911
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,486
We hid
in that jack-o'-lantern

912
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:30,960
so we could steal Halloween candy
from the trick-or-treaters?

913
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,643
I didn't notice the candle.
My tail caught on fire.

914
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:38,451
Meanwhile, you got away
with two bags of candy.

915
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:42,607
Or that time we mailed
ourselves to the peanut factory'?

916
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,570
You got there fine,

917
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,449
I got flagged
as a suspicious package

918
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:48,249
and spent two weeks at the FBI.

919
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,403
It should have been me
who fell off that ledge.

920
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,570
You're the lucky one.

921
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,768
You're the one
who always ends up okay.

922
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,440
Hey, you need a break.

923
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,760
I'm fine.

924
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,845
Tell me about Buddy.

925
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,602
How did you guys
get to be so close'?

926
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,568
I've known Buddy forever.

927
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:14,170
Met him the year
of the hurricane.

928
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,409
The sky was a terrible color.

929
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,043
Never seen anything like it.

930
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,963
Surly!
Whoa! Ahh!

931
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:31,085
Surly!

932
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,248
Wow! That sure is
a howler.

933
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:40,651
Bad as I've ever seen.

934
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:41,767
Oh, totally.

935
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:45,084
<i>SURLY 1 Then I saw him,
the tiniest mile rat.</i>

936
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:47,208
<i>Couldn't have been
more than a few weeks old.</i>

937
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,160
Wha... Oh, no!
We have to help him.

938
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:51,721
It's too late.

939
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:52,881
There's nothing we can do.

940
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:54,847
No!

941
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,285
Seal the door.

942
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:59,204
Wait. I'm coming
for you, little buddy.

943
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,442
Whoa!

944
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,727
Little guy.
Little buddy.

945
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,607
Oof!

946
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,126
Hang on!

947
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,247
Hang on!

948
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:26,971
You got it. You got it.

949
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,247
Get down!

950
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,805
<i>That's when I blacked out.</i>

951
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,486
<i>I have no idea
how he kept me alive.</i>

952
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:41,928
<i>He never spoke a word about it.</i>

953
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:44,485
<i>Or anything else.</i>

954
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,201
When I woke up, he was there,

955
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,488
and he hasn't left
my side ever since.

956
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:58,924
Can you believe this
goofball saved my life'?

957
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:01,529
Sounds like you saved
each other.

958
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,721
Bring it down nice and easy.

959
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,722
Okay, that's good.

960
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:25,760
Libraryland?

961
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:28,121
Guh! That doesn't
sound fun at all.

962
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,885
It says "Libertyland,"
you moron.

963
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:32,690
You should've gone
to Libraryland

964
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,444
when you was a kid.
Oof!

965
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:37,803
Tell your crew of illiterate
layabouts to hurry up!

966
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,809
Mr. Mayor,
if we go any faster,

967
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:41,882
we're gonna have
to start cuttin' corners.

968
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:44,486
So cut 'em. I never liked corners.

969
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:47,928
I prefer rounded shapes myself.

970
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:51,010
Look at this ride.
Those are office chairs.

971
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,601
Kids love office chairs.

972
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,605
What if somebody gets hurt?

973
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:59,730
That is an excellent point.

974
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,484
I'm gonna need you
to make a sign

975
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,369
with large red letters
that says,

976
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,602
"No refunds!"

977
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,124
We've gotta do something.

978
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:13,965
So do something.

979
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:17,361
We need you
to come up with a plan.

980
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,727
Your plan is for me
to come up with a plan'?

981
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,160
Oh, that's a great plan.

982
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,922
News flash, Andie.
My crazy plans don't work.

983
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,490
Look what happened to Buddy.

984
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:31,891
Look at them, Surly.
They've lost the Nut Shop.

985
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:34,122
They've lost the park.
There's nothing to eat,

986
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,611
but they're still here.

987
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:37,491
Why do you think that is?

988
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,482
'Cause there's nowhere
left to go.

989
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,608
They're here because of you.

990
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,489
They need something
to believe in.

991
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:46,289
I need something to believe in.

992
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:50,329
What happens if he doesn't
wake up, Andie?

993
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,085
Then what?

994
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:55,971
Hey, Buddy.

995
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,805
I never got a chance to say
thanks for breakin' me out.

996
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,565
Leave him alone.

997
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:04,923
I was just tryin' to say thanks.

998
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,168
Did... Did he just move?

999
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:10,800
Come on, Buddy.

1000
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:12,842
Wake up.
Come back to me, Buddy.

1001
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,285
Surly...

1002
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:16,887
Lick him again. Do it.
But... But you just said...

1003
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,803
Who cares what I said?
Just do it!

1004
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:25,245
Come on, come on.

1005
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,010
<i>I</i> knew it.

1006
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:32,884
Even in a coma, nobody can stand

1007
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,042
to have dog slobber
on their face.

1008
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:36,686
Hey, I resent that.

1009
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,205
I've seen the places you lick.

1010
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:39,561
Touché.

1011
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:42,361
Now, hit him with
everything you got.

1012
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,450
Buddy.

1013
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,250
I thought I'd lost you.

1014
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,929
My licks are magical.

1015
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:02,684
Hey, anybody else need one?

1016
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,125
No, we're good.

1017
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,131
I'm so sorry, Buddy.

1018
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:09,050
I promise, I'll never do
anything reckless again.

1019
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:14,088
Don't turn over
a new leaf just yet.

1020
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:16,090
We still need to save the park.

1021
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,250
What do you expect me to do?

1022
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,846
Lead us into battle against
the mayor and his goons?

1023
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,850
Destroy all the rides and take
back Liberty Park by force'?

1024
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,729
I mean, come on.

1025
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:32,845
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.

1026
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:38,526
Jeez, guys, that's kind of
a lot of pressure.

1027
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,882
You can do it, boss.
It's all you.

1028
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,807
No, it's not all me.

1029
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:46,964
If we wanna stop these guys,

1030
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:49,290
it's gonna take everyone.

1031
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,643
Gather 'round.
Let's make a plan.

1032
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:57,489
Thank you. Thank you.

1033
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,643
- Thank you all for coming.
- Mr. Mayor.

1034
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:01,085
What are you waiting for?

1035
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:02,286
Take my picture!

1036
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,131
That kid's a monster.

1037
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:06,641
Her and the dog both.

1038
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:08,844
Hey, Frankie's nothing like her.

1039
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:10,843
You've got no idea
what he's been through.

1040
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:12,604
Come on, Frankie, move it.

1041
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,122
Mr. Mayor, what do you say
to allegations

1042
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:18,329
that this amusement park is
an environmental catastrophe?

1043
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:21,125
Uh, well...
I, uh... I, um...

1044
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:24,206
No questions!

1045
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,487
All right.
Well, then hit the switch.

1046
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,485
"Lie-land"?

1047
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:33,642
Uh... I'll get that fixed
right away.

1048
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:35,685
Nah, don't bother.

1049
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,569
No sense in running up
the electric bill.

1050
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:39,404
Mr. Mayor.
Hey.

1051
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:40,481
What's going on?

1052
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:45,691
Now, now, tonight is an exclusive
event for my campaign contributors.

1053
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:50,404
You will be more than welcome to buy
your very own full-price tickets

1054
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:52,648
when it opens to the public.

1055
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,166
Perfect timing.

1056
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,163
Launch the aerial campaign!

1057
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,010
Ahh! My eye!

1058
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:03,447
That's the sign!
That's the sign!

1059
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:10,605
Remember your training.

1060
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:11,886
You had training?

1061
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:18,768
I'm good to go.
I'm good to go.

1062
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,966
I'm flyin'. I'm flyin'.

1063
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:37,521
Yeah.

1064
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,045
Ha-ha.

1065
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:43,961
Yeah.
Whoo!

1066
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:49,722
Time to eat my vegetables.

1067
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:53,168
And by vegetables,
I mean ketchup. Huh?

1068
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,131
Oh, boy!
Whoo-hoo!

1069
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,890
Ooh.
Yeah.

1070
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,601
- White tuxedo.
- Target acquired.

1071
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:10,246
When that clock
hits 9:00, we attack.

1072
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:15,961
That clock
hasn't worked in 30 years.

1073
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:17,567
What? Gah!

1074
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:19,803
All right, fine.
Everyone go.

1075
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:21,450
Just forget the clock.
Just go.

1076
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,167
Ah! My white tuxedo!

1077
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:34,604
Dive! Dive! Dive!

1078
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:38,206
Get 'em! Go, go, go, go, go!

1079
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:39,850
Go, go!

1080
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:43,761
Stop pecking me!

1081
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,764
Ahh! m!

1082
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:53,808
Drink up! Drink up!

1083
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:57,321
Got him.

1084
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,243
Whack that mole.
Whack-a-mole.

1085
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:02,085
How do you like it?
How do you like it'?

1086
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:06,160
The very existence
of this game offends me.

1087
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:10,929
Nice chewin', guys.

1088
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,490
Ahh!

1089
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:25,330
I want that squirrel's head
deep-fried on a stick!

1090
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,170
What are you doing?
What?

1091
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:43,163
Nobody likes a parking hog.

1092
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,006
Ugh. Fine.

1093
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,730
Move, move, move, move, move!

1094
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:01,321
Ahh!

1095
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,524
Spread out, spread out.

1096
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:10,842
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

1097
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,201
Yeah. We're not
gonna hurt you.

1098
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:15,241
Punch it!

1099
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,528
Whoo! It's Groundhog Day!

1100
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,564
You are a terrible driver.

1101
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,608
What do you expect?
I'm a groundhog.

1102
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,007
I need backup.
I need backup!

1103
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:27,604
Whoa!

1104
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:29,250
I got him.
Watch the road.

1105
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:30,526
Watch the road!

1106
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:35,525
- What the...
- Let me go!

1107
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:36,647
Got 'em.

1108
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,006
Six more weeks of winter.

1109
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,844
Yeah, that's a groundhog joke!

1110
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:44,765
Whoa! Everybody take cover.

1111
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,724
Come here, fuzzy little guy.

1112
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:48,840
Where do you think you're going?

1113
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:53,049
Buddy, stay behind me.

1114
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:55,043
- Surly!
- Precious, look out!

1115
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,044
Ahh! Let me go, you...

1116
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:58,167
Precious!

1117
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,083
No, Buddy.

1118
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:06,764
No! Buddy!

1119
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:08,931
Gotcha, you little critter!
Oh!

1120
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,720
Okay, boys.
Move it through!

1121
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:22,521
Andie. Andie, up here.

1122
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:27,729
Surly, they've got everyone.

1123
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,763
The groundhogs,
Mole, even Buddy.

1124
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:32,601
We can't win this thing.

1125
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:33,966
Sure we can.

1126
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:37,769
No, Andie, we can't.
Not with only two of us.

1127
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:40,686
But we have to try.

1128
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,365
Save yourself.

1129
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:46,730
Surly, stop.

1130
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:48,370
Find somewhere to hide.

1131
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:50,600
Surly.

1132
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:54,527
Ah!

1133
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:59,645
That's all of them,
Mr. Mayor.

1134
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:01,211
Ladies and gentlemen,

1135
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:03,607
get back out there
and have a good time.

1136
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:08,482
I assure you that our little
rodent problem has been solved.

1137
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:33,250
I know you're out there!

1138
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:36,529
Come and get me!

1139
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:44,120
Mr. Feng will be
happy to see you.

1140
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:46,491
Ahh!

1141
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:49,204
Get going! Move it!

1142
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:52,245
You were a lot cuter
before you had a weapon.

1143
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:55,927
Hey, you're a long way from
the park, little squirrel.

1144
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:58,567
Yeah, you're in the city now.

1145
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:01,681
Ahh!

1146
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,080
Oh! Oh! Ah!

1147
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:23,043
Oh! Oh! Oof.

1148
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:33,881
Huh?

1149
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:43,728
I told you to stay
out of the city.

1150
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:47,489
You didn't listen.
Now, you gonna pay.

1151
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:49,000
I came to talk to you.

1152
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:50,526
Get rid of him.

1153
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:51,726
What's the problem?

1154
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:54,686
You too cute
to face me yourself'?

1155
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,047
"Cute"?

1156
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:03,170
Never call me cute!

1157
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:05,607
Yeah, yeah. Never call
you cute, I heard you.

1158
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:07,523
But guess what?
You are cute,

1159
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:09,927
and no matter how many
times you kick me... Ahh!

1160
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:11,890
Or punch me... Ahh!

1161
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:15,202
It's not gonna change
the fact that you're cute.

1162
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:18,045
You're an animal,
and all animals are cute.

1163
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:19,406
Well, with the exception
of the platypus.

1164
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:20,606
Those things are rough.

1165
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:23,248
Why are you here?

1166
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:25,642
I need your help
to take back the park.

1167
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:28,009
I don't care about your park.

1168
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:29,525
I used to live in the park.

1169
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,206
We all did.

1170
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,128
<i>We were peaceful and hawk</i>

1171
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:36,123
<i>but people called us vermin.</i>

1172
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:37,440
<i>They forced us out.</i>

1173
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:40,211
<i>They turned our home
into a gob' course.</i>

1174
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:43,889
<i>We hid in the city
and vowed to transform</i>

1175
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:45,644
<i>from cute and peaceful</i>

1176
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:47,802
<i>to armed and dangerous.</i>

1177
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:52,847
<i>We trained with the kung fu
masters of the Shaoiin Temple.</i>

1178
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:56,210
<i>We grew strong
and made sure our home</i>

1179
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:58,647
<i>would never be in danger again.</i>

1180
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:03,324
Now I'm a city mouse,
and I hate parks.

1181
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:06,126
Ahh! Oof.

1182
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:10,569
There's no such thing <i>as</i> a
city mouse or a park mouse.

1183
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,331
We're all animals,

1184
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,482
and we need to look out
for each other.

1185
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:19,401
Don't you see?

1186
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:22,006
They're doing the same thing
to us that they did to you.

1187
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:24,242
This is your chance
to do the right thing.

1188
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:25,924
Enough!

1189
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:29,769
You might <i>as</i> well do it

1190
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:32,605
because if you don't help me
save my friends,

1191
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:34,682
I got nothing to live for.

1192
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:48,170
Mmm.

1193
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:50,364
Is everyone here?

1194
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:52,610
Everyone but Surly.

1195
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:54,284
What happened to Surly?

1196
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:56,328
He's probably got
those animal control creeps

1197
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:57,765
right where he wants 'em.

1198
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:01,880
You're not gonna like
where you're going.

1199
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:08,726
What's going on?
Where are they taking us?

1200
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:10,564
We're all gonna die.

1201
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:13,007
Definitely gonna die.

1202
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:17,801
Stop!

1203
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:20,565
Hello, road kill!

1204
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:23,487
Now!

1205
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:25,403
Charge!

1206
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,001
Surly?

1207
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:41,161
Before you get mad,

1208
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:43,766
just remember, you're the one
who wanted a crazy plan.

1209
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:47,684
I'd like you to meet
my new friend, Mr. Feng.

1210
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:51,090
Oh, he's so cute!

1211
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:53,448
Ahh!

1212
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:56,127
That reminds me,
don't call him cute.

1213
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:59,210
How did you convince a gang
of city mice to come help us?

1214
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:02,966
We are not city mice.
We are just mice.

1215
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:05,367
A long time ago,
Mr. Feng and his friends

1216
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:07,647
were chased out
of their homes, too.

1217
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:10,486
Nobody was there
to stand up for us,

1218
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:12,289
and we lost everything.

1219
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:15,090
But Surly is right.

1220
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:16,969
We are all animals,

1221
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:19,441
and we are in this together.

1222
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:21,648
Individually, we might be tiny,

1223
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:23,643
but together, we're giants.

1224
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:27,369
For the park!
For the park!

1225
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:29,289
For the park!

1226
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:38,241
Hey! How's it going?

1227
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:41,290
What the... Help! Ahh!
There's so many of them!

1228
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,401
Lift!

1229
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:54,164
Wow, that was close!

1230
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:57,208
Dig, dig, dig! Run!

1231
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,323
All right, Buddy!
Let 'er rip!

1232
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:07,364
Yeah, Buddy!

1233
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:09,569
That is what I'm talkin' about!

1234
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:12,490
Hey, guys!
The swarm went over... Whoa!

1235
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:17,810
Popcorn! Popcorn!

1236
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:19,521
Ahh!

1237
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:25,325
Oh!

1238
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:39,810
Hey, Frankie.

1239
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:43,451
I thought I'd stop by,
see how you're doing.

1240
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:45,971
I'm fine.

1241
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:50,042
I also wanted to say
that I'm sorry.

1242
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:52,530
Don't worry about it.

1243
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:54,807
I'm used to people
treatin' me bad.

1244
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,803
Hey, nobody deserves
to live like that.

1245
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:00,326
You know, you don't need to
pretend to like me anymore.

1246
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:03,486
Hey. I'm not pretendin'.

1247
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:05,644
Then Why'd you run out on me?

1248
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:08,688
I don't regret
runnin' away, all right'?

1249
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:10,649
I regret not taking you with me.

1250
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:14,206
You looked out for me.

1251
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:16,681
You're a good guy
with a good heart.

1252
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:19,081
That's not somethin'
I'm gonna walk away from.

1253
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:22,083
Why should I trust you?

1254
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:27,251
What are you doing?

1255
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:29,448
I'm tryin' to regurgitate
somethin' for you.

1256
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:30,965
Sorry...

1257
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:34,243
I haven't eaten in a while.

1258
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:36,689
Oh, babe!

1259
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:38,489
You'd do that for me?

1260
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:43,609
Like you said,
together, we're Frecious.

1261
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:48,524
Knock them out.

1262
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:50,250
With pleasure.

1263
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:57,043
Now!
Look out!

1264
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:01,122
No, no, no! Precious!

1265
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:03,882
I'm fine!
It only hit my collar.

1266
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:07,281
<i>This is crazy!</i>

1267
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:09,727
You literally
took a bullet for me.

1268
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:11,211
That's, like, true love!

1269
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:12,327
I guess it is!

1270
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:13,400
Take the shot!

1271
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:16,330
Bye-bye, little doggies!

1272
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:20,728
What are you doing?
They're getting away!

1273
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:23,446
Ow! The tiny teeth
are so sharp!

1274
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:26,803
Do I have to do
everything myself?

1275
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:29,241
Ooh!

1276
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:32,720
Stop touching me!
What do you have against me?

1277
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:34,808
Not so defenseless now, are we?

1278
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:42,211
Andie, turn him this way!
Buddy, fire!

1279
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:50,643
Nice shot!
You shot me with a dart?

1280
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:53,605
<i>Uh-oh... um good.</i>

1281
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:01,729
Ooh... I don't feel so good.

1282
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:11,765
Hello, doggies!

1283
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:14,805
Heather, sit!

1284
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:16,441
Whoa.

1285
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:17,521
Play dead!

1286
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:20,761
Man, I'm good at this.
I should get a dog.

1287
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,887
It's coming right for us!
Take cover!

1288
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:28,041
Whoa!

1289
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:31,725
Hey! Stop! Wait!
Put me down!

1290
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:42,405
Stand up!
All together!

1291
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:45,324
Right, left! Right, left!

1292
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:47,284
Whoa! Dwayne, are you okay'?

1293
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:49,561
Hiyah!

1294
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,523
Get him!

1295
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:01,681
Flying fist!

1296
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:08,407
Look out!

1297
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:11,566
Get down!

1298
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,206
Yeah! Ha-ha!

1299
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:29,122
Don't mess with the little guy.

1300
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:31,368
I'm not gettin'
paid enough for this!

1301
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:34,125
Go, go!
Stop! Stop! I order you!

1302
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:36,727
Stop right there!

1303
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:40,527
Ahh!

1304
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:43,968
Please accept
my formal resignation.

1305
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:54,891
Hmm?

1306
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,243
Oh...

1307
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:03,040
That is a lot of sugar
for a little guy.

1308
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:11,002
No! No!

1309
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:13,051
Yikes!

1310
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:21,409
That has got to be
a safety violation.

1311
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:24,563
Whoever's in charge of this
place is going to jail.

1312
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:27,086
Ooh, I would hate
to be that guy.

1313
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:28,810
Ha!

1314
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:38,883
So long, suckers!

1315
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,810
I hear Canada is nice
this time of year.

1316
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:43,769
You're not getting away
that easy.

1317
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:45,126
TH-ta!

1318
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:46,687
Huh?

1319
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:49,726
Oof!

1320
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:52,526
He's getting away!

1321
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:55,520
Buddy, we don't have time
for rides!

1322
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:58,291
<i>Please keep your arms
and legs inside the ride at all times.</i>

1323
01:13:58,360 --> 01:13:59,930
<i>If an arm or leg
becomes detached,</i>

1324
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,604
<i>you can pick it up
at the Lost and Found,</i>

1325
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:03,682
<i>and remember, no refunds!</i>

1326
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:07,210
The balloon!
Buddy, you're a genius.

1327
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:13,526
Maybe we should put
the safety bar down.

1328
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:18,925
Safety bars are overrated.

1329
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:27,843
Humans actually like this?

1330
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,571
It's too far!
We're not gonna make it!

1331
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:46,765
Good idea, Buddy.

1332
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:49,486
We only got one shot at this.

1333
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:52,841
Here we go!
Here we go!

1334
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:54,922
Three! Two! One!

1335
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:56,724
Now!

1336
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:06,602
Oh, I'm gonna mount
your head on my wall!

1337
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:14,169
Time to take down
this sack of hot air.

1338
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:17,045
I should've exterminated you
when I had the chance.

1339
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:20,442
All right, time to take down
this sack of hot air.

1340
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:24,605
You destroyed Libertyland,
and now you're gonna die!

1341
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:27,522
Ahh! Ahh!

1342
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:29,011
Get off! Get off me!

1343
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:30,691
Ah!

1344
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:33,411
It's times like this
I wish I had rabies.

1345
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:36,687
Get off! Get off!

1346
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,887
Where is he?
Where'd he go'?

1347
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:48,283
Howdy.

1348
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:55,201
Oh, this is gonna be fun.

1349
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:05,887
Surly!
Andie!

1350
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:12,082
My taxidermist is
gonna have quite the job

1351
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:14,481
putting you back together again.

1352
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:20,210
What! What in the...

1353
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:22,806
This one's for Buddy!
Whoa!

1354
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:35,962
- I'm okay!
- Attack!

1355
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:38,407
Stop! Help! Help!
I'm not okay!

1356
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:39,720
Help!

1357
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:42,724
You mess with one of <i>us,</i>
you mess with all of us!

1358
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:46,603
Wow, those guys are hungry!

1359
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:48,842
Use your teeth, fellas!
Get in there!

1360
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:59,361
Mr. Mayor,
you're coming with me.

1361
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:01,324
Oh!

1362
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:04,085
Sarge, we're gonna
take this into evidence.

1363
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:06,686
Code seven.
Copy that, rookie.

1364
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:08,683
Get your hands off of me!

1365
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:10,410
Do you know who I am'?

1366
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:13,888
You, sir, are going to jail
for a long time!

1367
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:18,007
Help! I can't go to jail,
I'm rich!

1368
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:20,890
Get your hands off me!
Do you know who I am?

1369
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:23,006
Ahh!

1370
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:24,366
You.

1371
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:26,249
You shot me with a dart!

1372
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:28,004
Please, please!
Let me explain!

1373
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:32,122
Help! Somebody call
the police!

1374
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:34,680
Her tiny teeth are so sharp!

1375
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:36,683
Ah! Ow!

1376
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:39,491
This amusement park is closed!

1377
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:49,331
- Surly!
- Way to go, Surly!

1378
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:55,208
Hey, where's Andie?

1379
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:02,728
<i>Whoa-hem!</i>

1380
01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:07,208
Yeah!

1381
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:10,486
Whoo-hoo!

1382
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,841
Way to go, Andie!
Yay, Andie!

1383
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:31,963
Whoa!

1384
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:33,883
You go, Andie!

1385
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:35,803
Way to go, guys!

1386
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:37,490
We did it!

1387
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:39,969
Ugh, Buddy!

1388
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:42,004
Ugh, Precious, no licking!

1389
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:44,082
We talked about this.

1390
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:46,242
Ugh, come on, man.
We just met.

1391
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:48,482
Oh, ugh!

1392
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:50,767
Great. Two slobber monsters.

1393
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:51,887
The mayor is gone!

1394
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:54,804
The rides are destroyed!
We're all gonna...

1395
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:57,210
Live!

1396
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:08,161
<i>It took a lot of clean
up to get rid of Libertyiand,</i>

1397
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:10,288
<i>but everyone in town pitched in.</i>

1398
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:12,886
<i>Turns out,
some humans aren't half bad.</i>

1399
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:15,167
<i>Sure, they're ugly
and they've got no fur,</i>

1400
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:16,685
<i>but they're not half bad.</i>

1401
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,126
<i>So I bet you're wondering</i>

1402
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:22,044
<i>if I learned some huge
lesson from ail this.</i>

1403
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:25,681
<i>Nope! I'm happy to say,
I didn't learn a thing.</i>

1404
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:28,240
<i>- Surly!
- Okay, fine.</i>

1405
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:30,368
<i>I learned that
we're better together.</i>

1406
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:32,886
<i>When we put aside our
differences and work as a team,</i>

1407
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:34,564
<i>there's nothing we can't do.</i>

1408
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:39,161
<i>Mr. Feng and his friends
moved into the park</i>

1409
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:42,449
<i>and started exploring
more peaceful pursuits.</i>

1410
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:47,929
Tai Chi is like
fighting in slow-motion.

1411
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:51,491
Tough and cute.

1412
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:55,362
<i>Oh, and one more thing.</i>

1413
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:59,203
<i>I learned to appreciate what
was right in front of me.</i>

1414
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:09,644
All right, all right!
Stop lickin' Uncle Surly.

1415
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:12,690
I am so sorry! I don't know
what got into them.

1416
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:16,446
But, Dad, you said it's a
dog's job to chase squirrels.

1417
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:18,329
Frankie, what're you
teaching these kids'?

1418
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:20,289
Hey, I'm teaching them
the skills they need

1419
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:22,522
to be competitive
in the dog marketplace.

1420
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:23,806
Come on, pups!

1421
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:25,251
Let's go mark some territory!

1422
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:30,331
You know, Andie, you were right.

1423
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:32,289
I'm so happy we're
back in the park,

1424
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:34,886
living off the land
like nature intended.

1425
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:37,691
I can honestly say,
I'm a changed squirrel.

1426
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:39,649
Well, that's great, Surly.
Because l...

1427
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:41,848
What is that smell?

1428
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:47,764
It's a nut can!

1429
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:51,526
Please! Please! I promise
I'll only take one bag.

1430
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:54,251
Better make it two
'cause I am not sharing.

1431
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:55,401
Yes!

1432
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:57,244
This is why I love you.

1433
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:02,963
- Let's get nuts! Hiyah!
- Whoo!

1434
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:06,926
Ride, Precious! Ride! Hiyah!

1435
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:12,765
Ah!

1436
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:14,801
Ah!

1437
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:25,690
Witness the power of my

1438
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:27,728
one-sixteenth-of-an-inch
punch!

1439
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:29,685
Aw, that's cute!

1440
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:34,166
Can we do it one more time?
That one didn't feel right.

1441
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:35,571
- Cut!
- Take 28!

1442
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:37,531
Aw, that's cute!

1443
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:40,481
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry!

1444
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:42,403
- Cut!
- Take 44!

1445
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:47,283
Just too funny!

1446
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:49,283
Can we try one
without the punch?

1447
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:54,367
I said, don't call me cute!

1448
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:55,441
Get them!
