1
0:0:2.016 --> 0:0:3.385
You fucking dickhead!

2
0:0:3.417 --> 0:0:4.884
Fuck you!
I just saved your life!

3
0:0:4.918 --> 0:0:7.122
Yeah, and cost millions
of people theirs!

4
0:0:12.025 --> 0:0:13.494
(PANTING)

5
0:0:20.702 --> 0:0:23.671
All right, they're going
for cover and reloading.

6
0:0:23.704 --> 0:0:25.940
I'll fix their wagons.
Cover me, boys!

7
0:0:28.975 --> 0:0:30.010
Wait.

8
0:0:30.043 --> 0:0:32.613
Eggsy, I think he could be
working for the other side.

9
0:0:32.646 --> 0:0:34.481
What the fuck is wrong with you?

10
0:0:34.515 --> 0:0:37.051
You're having
a brain fart! Look!

11
0:0:37.084 --> 0:0:40.622
Does that look like
he's working with them?

12
0:0:40.654 --> 0:0:43.590
Harry, are you seeing
butterflies again?

13
0:0:43.623 --> 0:0:45.025
I know what I'm seeing.

14
0:0:48.128 --> 0:0:49.797
(GRUNTING)

15
0:1:7.014 --> 0:1:8.149
(GUNS CLICK)

16
0:1:36.910 --> 0:1:39.480
Good job
he didn't need our help.

17
0:1:39.514 --> 0:1:42.249
Thank fucking Christ
I didn't need any backup!

18
0:1:48.623 --> 0:1:51.058
I'm out of ammo!
Troop carrier coming in.

19
0:1:51.091 --> 0:1:52.192
What've you got?

20
0:1:54.028 --> 0:1:55.063
Fuck!

21
0:1:59.301 --> 0:2:0.936
Shit!
There's a fuck ton of 'em!

22
0:2:4.271 --> 0:2:5.907
What is this?

23
0:2:5.940 --> 0:2:8.910
Looks like you packed for
a fucking slumber party, not a mission!

24
0:2:10.011 --> 0:2:12.880
And they've got
fucking Gatling guns!

25
0:2:12.913 --> 0:2:16.216
MAN: You have 10 seconds
to surrender before we open fire!

26
0:2:16.251 --> 0:2:17.385
Guys, hurry up!

27
0:2:17.417 --> 0:2:18.451
MAN: 10!

28
0:2:18.485 --> 0:2:19.886
Hey!

29
0:2:19.921 --> 0:2:22.057
MAN: 9!
Butterfly guy!

30
0:2:23.457 --> 0:2:24.526
8!

31
0:2:24.559 --> 0:2:26.461
You don't look like
Ginger fixed you right.

32
0:2:26.493 --> 0:2:27.594
7!

33
0:2:27.627 --> 0:2:28.762
I said I'm empty!

34
0:2:28.797 --> 0:2:30.298
6!
Give me yours.

35
0:2:30.931 --> 0:2:31.799
5!

36
0:2:31.833 --> 0:2:33.167
Harry, give him the fucking gun!

37
0:2:33.199 --> 0:2:34.234
4!

38
0:2:35.669 --> 0:2:38.105
Harry, no!

39
0:2:42.243 --> 0:2:43.678
Oh, fuck it! Fire!

40
0:2:43.712 --> 0:2:44.946
Harry, get down!

41
0:2:52.453 --> 0:2:53.854
I mean, honestly, Harry,

42
0:2:53.887 --> 0:2:55.323
what the fuck is wrong with you?

43
0:2:55.355 --> 0:2:57.724
He broke the vial on purpose!

44
0:2:57.758 --> 0:3:0.160
You're a fucking idiot!
You're out of control, Harry!
