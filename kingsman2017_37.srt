1
0:0:8.401 --> 0:0:10.570
Luckily, I have this.

2
0:0:18.912 --> 0:0:22.682
This spray will freeze
the trigger mechanism...

3
0:0:22.716 --> 0:0:25.785
give us a split second.

4
0:0:26.587 --> 0:0:29.089
So on the count of three...

5
0:0:29.122 --> 0:0:30.390
what I want you to...

6
0:0:30.422 --> 0:0:31.658
Merlin!

7
0:0:37.564 --> 0:0:39.633
(PANTING)

8
0:0:47.440 --> 0:0:49.509
Merlin, what the fuck
have you done?

9
0:0:49.542 --> 0:0:53.112
Our journey together
began many years ago...

10
0:0:53.146 --> 0:0:55.783
when your father
did the same thing for us.

11
0:0:55.815 --> 0:0:58.517
Our journey began
with a mistake I made.

12
0:0:58.551 --> 0:1:0.621
Give me the can.
That's an order.

13
0:1:1.087 --> 0:1:2.156
Can's empty.

14
0:1:2.823 --> 0:1:4.591
Split second's over.

15
0:1:4.624 --> 0:1:6.260
You two need to get going.

16
0:1:6.292 --> 0:1:7.994
No, no, no.
There's got to be another way.

17
0:1:8.028 --> 0:1:9.029
HARRY: He's right.

18
0:1:9.063 --> 0:1:10.564
Mission comes first.

19
0:1:10.596 --> 0:1:11.931
Bollocks, mission comes first!

20
0:1:11.965 --> 0:1:13.033
Eggsy!

21
0:1:13.065 --> 0:1:15.702
This is no time for emotion.
Remember your training.

22
0:1:15.735 --> 0:1:17.171
Or we all die.

23
0:1:19.472 --> 0:1:21.274
Now get on with it.

24
0:1:21.306 --> 0:1:23.810
Do as you're told.
Move it!

25
0:1:31.251 --> 0:1:32.252
Go.

26
0:1:41.328 --> 0:1:42.329
It's been an honor.

27
0:1:44.597 --> 0:1:45.798
Good luck.
