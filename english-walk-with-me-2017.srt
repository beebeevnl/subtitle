1
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:16,208
<i>I know what it is to get angry,</i>

2
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,375
<i>and I know the pleasure of being praised.</i>

3
00:01:20,958 --> 00:01:24,708
<i>I'm often on the verge
of tears or laughter.</i>

4
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:30,500
<i>But beneath all these emotions,</i>

5
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:32,916
<i>what else is there?</i>

6
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:36,083
<i>How can I touch it?</i>

7
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:39,708
<i>If there isn't anything…</i>

8
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:44,125
<i>why would I be so certain that there is?</i>

9
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,729
Is it okay if you bang
the drum with the stick

10
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,666
wrapped like that?

11
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:08,979
Well, each stick will make

12
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,250
a different sound.

13
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:12,083
Try it.

14
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,708
Should we unwrap the other one

15
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:34,083
Shedding my hair completely…

16
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,250
Shedding my hair completely…

17
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,500
I make the great vow today…

18
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:40,708
I make the great vow today…

19
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,916
to transform all my afflictions…

20
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,458
to transform all my afflictions…

21
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,791
and to help all living beings.

22
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,750
And to help all living beings.

23
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:22,250
<i>When icy winter comes,</i>

24
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:27,708
<i>it is unforgiving to all things
young, tender and insecure.</i>

25
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:34,708
<i>One must grow beyond youthful
uncertainty to survive.</i>

26
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:39,875
<i>Maturity and determination are necessary.</i>

27
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:49,041
<i>Seeing the courageous, solid way</i>

28
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,750
<i>that trees prepare for winter</i>

29
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:55,875
<i>helps me appreciate
the lessons I've learned.</i>

30
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,708
You need to remove that word here.

31
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:42,541
What's going on here?

32
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:45,708
I'm not high enough here.

33
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,125
No, that's not it.

34
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,875
Yes, there's always that problem.

35
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:00,708
When the garden is fully weeded…

36
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,125
the flowers, symbol of enlightenment…

37
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:08,875
have the opportunity

38
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:11,375
to continue to grow.

39
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:27,666
You need compost…

40
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,541
to have flowers…

41
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,250
and you need to have suffering…

42
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:37,791
to be awakened.

43
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,416
Full stop.

44
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:46,541
Suffering is the compost.

45
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:49,375
The food of awakening.

46
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:50,375
Full stop.

47
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,729
You have to look for enlightenment

48
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:56,416
in the suffering.

49
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:03,583
This is why we have the expression…

50
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:08,708
"Suffering is enlightenment."

51
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:10,750
And:

52
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,208
"Finding Nirvana in birth and death."

53
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:59,541
Here is the first precept.

54
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:02,708
You cannot have sexual intercourse.

55
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,833
If a Shikshamana has sexual intercourse,

56
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:09,333
she can no longer remain a Shikshamana.

57
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,417
She can no longer be called a nun,

58
00:19:11,418 --> 00:19:13,458
a daughter of the Buddha.

59
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:17,541
If she has not had sexual intercourse

60
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,875
but has touched the body of someone else

61
00:19:19,876 --> 00:19:22,166
out of sexual desire,

62
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:24,458
although she's still a nun,

63
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,458
she has not kept the Shikshamana precepts.

64
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,875
She has to confess and take
the precepts again.

65
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:37,166
This is the first
of the six Shikshamana precepts.

66
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:39,791
Is your precepts body clear?

67
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:52,208
Do you understand this verse?

68
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:58,041
"Listening to the dharma
in the ultimate dimension…"

69
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:02,875
I see the autumn leaves fall…

70
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,708
occupying the whole sky.

71
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:12,458
I see the autumn moon…

72
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:17,708
in every… on every path… all path.

73
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:23,083
"But the dharma is neither full nor empty."

74
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,083
And the hermit sleeps in here.

75
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,750
<i>At first, it seemed like a passing cloud.</i>

76
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,750
<i>But after several hours,</i>

77
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:25,500
<i>I begin to feel my body turning to smoke</i>

78
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:27,541
<i>and floating away.</i>

79
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:34,250
<i>I became a faint wisp of a cloud.</i>

80
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:38,041
<i>I had always thought
of myself as a solid entity.</i>

81
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:43,375
<i>And suddenly I saw that I am
not solid at all.</i>

82
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:48,125
<i>I saw that the entity I had taken to be me</i>

83
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:50,416
<i>was really a fabrication.</i>

84
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:55,500
<i>My true nature, I realized,</i>

85
00:23:55,541 --> 00:23:59,083
<i>was much more real,</i>

86
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:04,208
<i>both uglier and more beautiful
than I could ever have imagined.</i>

87
00:25:09,416 --> 00:25:11,875
- The other day I asked Sister Cam Nghiem
- if she felt happy.

88
00:25:12,708 --> 00:25:15,041
"Am I happy?" she said.

89
00:25:15,083 --> 00:25:17,583
"It's hard. I don't know if I'm happy."

90
00:25:17,625 --> 00:25:20,125
And then I asked if she felt…

91
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:25,750
if she felt… satisfied

92
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:28,125
and she said, "Yes."

93
00:25:36,791 --> 00:25:39,229
Yeah, you just keep cooking all the time,

94
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:41,666
and it can be enjoyable.

95
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:47,708
But when you run out of ideas,
you get sick of it.

96
00:25:49,583 --> 00:25:52,125
Maybe for others it's different…

97
00:25:53,625 --> 00:25:57,375
but if I do the same thing
for too long, I get bored.

98
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:03,375
If it's your responsibility,
you just do it.

99
00:26:03,416 --> 00:26:07,458
As for liking it? I just
don't like repetitive tasks.

100
00:26:12,583 --> 00:26:14,625
There are times I do things

101
00:26:14,626 --> 00:26:16,666
out of love for our teacher.

102
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:20,125
That helps with the boredom.

103
00:26:21,416 --> 00:26:23,958
But sometimes I have to get out of here.

104
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,041
Then when I come back
I feel fresh again for him.

105
00:26:30,291 --> 00:26:32,500
We're close to our teacher.
That's why we sometimes

106
00:26:32,501 --> 00:26:34,708
feel bored.

107
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:37,333
The younger ones who don't get
as much time with our teacher

108
00:26:37,375 --> 00:26:39,750
- are probably very happy to spend
every moment - they can with him.

109
00:26:42,833 --> 00:26:44,375
Okay, it's ready.

110
00:26:44,416 --> 00:26:46,708
Ready? Wow, you're good!

111
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:09,604
Are you going to put
the napkin on the right?

112
00:27:09,605 --> 00:27:11,916
No, it goes on the left.

113
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:43,500
<i>Friends want you to appear</i>

114
00:27:43,541 --> 00:27:46,000
<i>in the familiar form they know.</i>

115
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:49,208
<i>But that is impossible.</i>

116
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:55,583
<i>How could we continue to live
if we were changeless?</i>

117
00:27:56,958 --> 00:27:58,208
<i>To live…</i>

118
00:27:59,333 --> 00:28:02,208
<i>we must die every instant.</i>

119
00:28:03,416 --> 00:28:06,500
<i>We must perish again and again</i>

120
00:28:06,541 --> 00:28:09,875
<i>in the storms that make life possible.</i>

121
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:36,500
<i>I became a battlefield,</i>

122
00:30:36,541 --> 00:30:38,896
<i>and I couldn't know
until the storm was over</i>

123
00:30:38,897 --> 00:30:41,250
<i>if I would survive.</i>

124
00:30:41,291 --> 00:30:44,500
<i>Not in the sense of my physical life,</i>

125
00:30:44,541 --> 00:30:48,083
<i>but in the deeper sense of my core self.</i>

126
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:54,291
<i>I experienced distraction upon distraction</i>

127
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:56,687
<i>and felt a tremendous
longing for the presence</i>

128
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:59,041
<i>of those I love.</i>

129
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:04,416
<i>Even though I knew
that if they were present,</i>

130
00:31:04,458 --> 00:31:07,666
<i>I would have to chase them away</i>

131
00:31:07,708 --> 00:31:09,875
<i>or run away myself.</i>

132
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:02,750
I took out 500. Okay.

133
00:32:02,791 --> 00:32:05,250
So, um…

134
00:32:05,291 --> 00:32:08,875
Or I could do the first week and then…
whichever.

135
00:32:08,916 --> 00:32:10,541
- That's fine. Is that fine to do?
- First week?

136
00:32:12,958 --> 00:32:15,958
Children find other children.

137
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,041
So in your case,

138
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:21,791
- going in a young adults group won't
work because you - have children.

139
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:23,666
Ah, okay, I understand.

140
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:25,416
That's fine.

141
00:32:50,625 --> 00:32:53,500
- You know the score with the clock chiming, right?
- You've heard about this?

142
00:32:53,541 --> 00:32:56,291
Yes, someone told me about it.
Isn't it every 15 minutes?

143
00:32:56,333 --> 00:32:58,292
That clock chimes every 15 minutes.

144
00:32:58,293 --> 00:33:00,250
Okay.

145
00:33:00,291 --> 00:33:03,250
But generally in Plum Village,

146
00:33:03,291 --> 00:33:09,333
every time we hear a bell,
we stop what we are doing.

147
00:33:09,375 --> 00:33:11,791
- And that's all about coming back
- to the present moment,

148
00:33:11,833 --> 00:33:13,979
Because we often find
ourselves on autopilot, and

149
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,125
the idea is to get out of that.

150
00:33:16,166 --> 00:33:19,000
It's difficult and requires
a lot of training,

151
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:21,333
but here we train together.

152
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:29,333
I have a doggy,

153
00:40:29,375 --> 00:40:32,958
and this doggy died, and I was very sad,

154
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,750
so I don't know how to be not so sad.

155
00:40:46,916 --> 00:40:49,458
This is a very difficult question.

156
00:40:52,208 --> 00:40:56,458
Suppose, uh, you look, uh, into the sky…

157
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,479
Look up into the sky and you see

158
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,458
a beautiful cloud.

159
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,791
And you like the cloud so much.

160
00:41:04,833 --> 00:41:09,625
And suddenly the cloud is no longer there.

161
00:41:09,666 --> 00:41:11,208
And you think that the cloud

162
00:41:11,209 --> 00:41:12,750
has passed away.

163
00:41:12,791 --> 00:41:15,916
Where is my beloved cloud now?

164
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:20,958
So if you have time to reflect,

165
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,041
to look,

166
00:41:23,083 --> 00:41:26,208
you'll see that the cloud has not died,

167
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,583
has not passed away.

168
00:41:28,625 --> 00:41:31,541
The cloud has become the rain.

169
00:41:31,583 --> 00:41:33,791
And when you look at the rain,

170
00:41:33,833 --> 00:41:36,125
you see your cloud.

171
00:41:36,166 --> 00:41:39,500
And when you drink your tea mindfully,

172
00:41:39,541 --> 00:41:42,375
you can see the rain in your tea

173
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:44,083
and your cloud in your tea.

174
00:41:44,125 --> 00:41:47,333
And you can say, "Hello, my cloud."

175
00:41:47,375 --> 00:41:49,750
I know you have not died.

176
00:41:49,791 --> 00:41:52,958
"You are still alive in a new form."

177
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,041
So doggy is the same.

178
00:41:56,083 --> 00:41:58,229
And if you look very
deeply, you can see doggy

179
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:00,375
in its new form.

180
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:25,625
<i>When the storm finally passed,</i>

181
00:42:25,666 --> 00:42:29,916
<i>layers of inner mortal lay crumbled.</i>

182
00:42:29,958 --> 00:42:33,416
<i>On the now-deserted battlefield,</i>

183
00:42:33,458 --> 00:42:37,791
<i>a few sunbeams peeked through the horizon,</i>

184
00:42:37,833 --> 00:42:41,875
<i>too weak to offer any warmth
to my weary soul.</i>

185
00:42:50,791 --> 00:42:53,458
<i>I was full of wounds,</i>

186
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:59,000
<i>yet experienced an almost
thrilling sense of aloneness.</i>

187
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:04,708
<i>No one would recognize me
in my new manifestation.</i>

188
00:43:07,958 --> 00:43:11,875
<i>No one close to me would know it was I.</i>

189
00:45:22,958 --> 00:45:28,083
Hieu, you have given me so much happiness.

190
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:34,500
When your father left, you gave me energy

191
00:45:34,541 --> 00:45:36,708
so that I could continue to go to work

192
00:45:36,709 --> 00:45:38,875
and live with you.

193
00:45:41,458 --> 00:45:44,666
I know that what's happened is my fault.

194
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:46,500
My job is so stressful, and I don't know

195
00:45:46,501 --> 00:45:48,291
how to control it.

196
00:45:48,333 --> 00:45:51,541
That's why sometimes when
Mom comes home late,

197
00:45:51,583 --> 00:45:53,146
I don't have space to think or breathe,

198
00:45:53,147 --> 00:45:54,708
and I yell at you, my child.

199
00:45:57,458 --> 00:45:59,791
I promise that I will do better

200
00:45:59,833 --> 00:46:02,083
and that I will breathe like our teacher,

201
00:46:02,084 --> 00:46:04,333
Thich Nhat Hanh, has taught us.

202
00:46:07,458 --> 00:46:13,708
I just want to say
that Mom loves you a lot.

203
00:46:38,791 --> 00:46:40,208
Breathing in…

204
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I enjoy my in-breath.

205
00:46:48,166 --> 00:46:49,750
Breathing out…

206
00:46:51,916 --> 00:46:54,875
I let go of the out-breath.

207
00:46:58,958 --> 00:47:00,583
In-breath.

208
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:04,125
Out-breath.

209
00:48:11,125 --> 00:48:12,916
There is a song

210
00:48:12,958 --> 00:48:16,458
that we like to sing in Plum Village.

211
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:20,250
"I have arrive, I am home."

212
00:48:20,291 --> 00:48:22,666
This is a song of practice…

213
00:48:24,375 --> 00:48:26,708
because the practice of mindfulness

214
00:48:26,709 --> 00:48:29,041
is to always arrive.

215
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:34,541
Arrive in the here and the now.

216
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:41,583
We have been running a lot…
but we have not arrived.

217
00:48:45,458 --> 00:48:47,625
We are always looking for something,

218
00:48:47,666 --> 00:48:49,750
searching for something,

219
00:48:49,791 --> 00:48:51,416
longing for something.

220
00:48:52,708 --> 00:48:55,875
And we have not found it.

221
00:48:55,916 --> 00:48:58,208
And we continue to run.

222
00:48:59,958 --> 00:49:02,375
And we don't know how long…

223
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:08,416
how much more we have to run

224
00:49:08,458 --> 00:49:11,583
and look for what we are looking for.

225
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:17,188
Maybe you are looking for some conditions

226
00:49:17,189 --> 00:49:19,125
of happiness

227
00:49:19,166 --> 00:49:21,583
that we believe we don't have.

228
00:49:24,375 --> 00:49:29,041
And running, searching has become a habit.

229
00:49:29,083 --> 00:49:34,583
And life and all the wonders of life

230
00:49:34,625 --> 00:49:37,708
are available only in the present moment.

231
00:49:39,208 --> 00:49:42,916
Because the past is no longer there,

232
00:49:42,958 --> 00:49:45,416
the future is not yet there.

233
00:49:45,458 --> 00:49:48,416
There's only the present moment.

234
00:49:48,458 --> 00:49:50,708
So the practice of mindfulness help us…

235
00:49:52,333 --> 00:49:55,291
to go home to the here and the now

236
00:49:55,333 --> 00:49:59,916
in order for us to learn
how to live our life deeply.

237
00:50:01,791 --> 00:50:04,750
That way we will not waste our life.

238
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:58,958
<i>Mountains and rivers,</i>

239
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,916
<i>Earth and sun</i>

240
00:54:01,958 --> 00:54:05,375
<i>all lie within the heart of consciousness.</i>

241
00:54:06,916 --> 00:54:09,541
<i>When that realization arises,</i>

242
00:54:09,583 --> 00:54:12,875
<i>time and space dissolve.</i>

243
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:15,000
<i>Cause and effect,</i>

244
00:54:15,041 --> 00:54:18,375
<i>birth and death all vanish.</i>

245
00:54:20,375 --> 00:54:22,729
<i>Though I dwell
a hundred thousand light-years</i>

246
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:25,083
<i>from a star,</i>

247
00:54:25,125 --> 00:54:28,916
<i>I can cross that distance in a flash.</i>

248
00:55:50,625 --> 00:55:52,583
Oh, that feels good.

249
00:55:52,625 --> 00:55:55,541
Let the teamaster take
care of the cups, please.

250
00:55:58,916 --> 00:56:01,666
Are there any more cups?

251
00:56:01,708 --> 00:56:04,541
Phap Luu has very long legs, so
he can reach you from there.

252
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Christ can save you!

253
00:57:11,041 --> 00:57:14,833
And the word of God has shown in its…

254
00:57:14,875 --> 00:57:17,125
Buddha cannot save you.

255
00:57:17,166 --> 00:57:19,458
Muhammad cannot save you.

256
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:22,333
Krishna cannot save you.

257
00:57:22,375 --> 00:57:24,833
Charles Darwin cannot save you,

258
00:57:24,875 --> 00:57:27,416
and you cannot save yourself!

259
00:57:27,458 --> 00:57:29,583
I cannot save myself!

260
00:57:39,875 --> 00:57:43,333
The devil, Satan, is real!

261
00:57:43,375 --> 00:57:44,708
God is real!

262
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:46,833
God is real!

263
00:57:46,875 --> 00:57:51,083
If you are not with Jehovah God,

264
00:57:51,125 --> 00:57:53,125
if you are not with Jesus Christ…

265
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:56,041
you are against him.

266
00:57:56,083 --> 00:57:59,416
I didn't say it. He said it.

267
00:57:59,458 --> 00:58:03,375
So why would you follow
a dead end to Buddha,

268
00:58:03,416 --> 00:58:04,958
when you can believe in Jesus

269
00:58:04,959 --> 00:58:06,500
and have eternal life?

270
00:58:06,541 --> 00:58:08,666
- Praise the Lord! You don't know that
- for a fact!

271
00:58:08,708 --> 00:58:11,250
Jesus said it! What about what Jesus said

272
00:58:11,291 --> 00:58:13,375
about loving everyone
and turning the other cheek?

273
00:58:13,416 --> 00:58:15,541
What I'm teaching here…

274
00:58:15,583 --> 00:58:17,958
Why won't you listen to the dialogue?

275
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,083
Because you're afraid
that I'm telling the truth?

276
00:58:20,125 --> 00:58:23,666
- You're so afraid I'm telling the truth
you don't - want to get to the dialogue?

277
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:25,000
Hallelujah! You are attempting

278
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:26,291
vile gossip.

279
00:58:26,333 --> 00:58:28,625
That is why you're getting
angry and riled up.

280
00:58:28,666 --> 00:58:30,750
- I'm not angry. You're the one
- who's angry, sir.

281
00:58:30,791 --> 00:58:32,562
Notice you don't… Notice you don't

282
00:58:32,563 --> 00:58:34,333
put down the Buddhists.

283
00:58:34,375 --> 00:58:37,083
You're the only one here
putting down the Buddhists.

284
00:58:37,125 --> 00:58:38,791
Nobody else here is putting anyone down.

285
00:58:38,833 --> 00:58:40,583
You're the only one condemning people.

286
00:58:40,625 --> 00:58:43,166
- Jesus said love everyone. He never
said anything - about judging people.

287
00:58:43,208 --> 00:58:45,416
Jesus Christ. That's it.

288
00:58:45,458 --> 00:58:47,750
Hey! The Savior.

289
00:59:39,416 --> 00:59:42,791
Walk a little faster.

290
00:59:42,833 --> 00:59:45,250
Almost like a normal pace.

291
00:59:45,291 --> 00:59:47,875
Walk a little faster.

292
00:59:50,583 --> 00:59:53,375
Walk really, really fast.

293
00:59:53,416 --> 00:59:54,771
Walk really,

294
00:59:54,772 --> 00:59:56,125
really fast.

295
00:59:56,166 --> 00:59:58,333
Pay attention to your foot
while you're doing this.

296
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,875
Now you can stop.

297
01:00:03,916 --> 01:00:05,375
Stop.

298
01:00:21,083 --> 01:00:24,541
- You guys ever seen any monks or nuns before?
- In movies.

299
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:29,750
- Where do you guys sleep at?
- Where?

300
01:00:29,791 --> 01:00:31,916
We have… We usually share a room.

301
01:00:31,958 --> 01:00:34,083
So there'd be like four people in a room.

302
01:00:34,125 --> 01:00:36,625
And, um, I think at the beginning,

303
01:00:36,666 --> 01:00:38,416
our monastery was really simple.

304
01:00:38,458 --> 01:00:40,541
There was nothing there. They had no beds.

305
01:00:40,583 --> 01:00:43,291
They didn't have money to buy beds.

306
01:00:43,333 --> 01:00:47,500
Because we take a vow to not
have any personal possessions.

307
01:00:47,541 --> 01:00:50,958
- So we don't have money. We don't have a bank account.
- We don't have a credit card.

308
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,666
We don't have a personal
card or, you know, like a…

309
01:00:54,708 --> 01:00:56,166
Cell phone. Cell phone.

310
01:00:56,208 --> 01:00:58,583
We don't have… We don't have money.

311
01:00:58,625 --> 01:01:00,208
We don't get paid at all.

312
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:02,000
We get pocket money,

313
01:01:02,041 --> 01:01:04,000
but we get just like, uh…

314
01:01:04,041 --> 01:01:06,750
It's about $40 a month.

315
01:01:06,791 --> 01:01:10,208
I can't survive. Can't survive.

316
01:01:12,875 --> 01:01:15,166
- You know, when you have a house
- and you have a car

317
01:01:15,208 --> 01:01:18,833
- And you have all that stuff,
actually you kind - of worry about it.

318
01:01:18,875 --> 01:01:21,125
It's not just, uh…

319
01:01:22,875 --> 01:01:24,625
You think it's going to be…

320
01:01:24,666 --> 01:01:27,416
You think you'll be happy
when you get all that stuff,

321
01:01:27,458 --> 01:01:30,500
but when you get it,
maybe you're not happy.

322
01:01:30,541 --> 01:01:32,208
Have you ever had that?

323
01:01:32,250 --> 01:01:34,125
You really think you're gonna be happy

324
01:01:34,126 --> 01:01:36,000
when you get something.

325
01:01:36,041 --> 01:01:39,000
- And when you get it, actually you're not happy.
- Yeah.

326
01:01:39,041 --> 01:01:41,333
- And if you break one of the rules,
- what happens?

327
01:01:41,375 --> 01:01:43,666
Well, there's different kinds of rules.

328
01:01:43,708 --> 01:01:46,229
Say you start dating
and then smoking and stuff,

329
01:01:46,230 --> 01:01:48,750
what happens?

330
01:01:48,791 --> 01:01:50,208
Then you're not a monk anymore.

331
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:53,000
Are you guys single

332
01:01:53,041 --> 01:01:55,416
We are single. We're not married.

333
01:01:55,458 --> 01:01:57,417
Because we choose to live the life

334
01:01:57,418 --> 01:01:59,375
that doesn't involve sex

335
01:01:59,416 --> 01:02:02,916
or a partner or anybody else.

336
01:02:02,958 --> 01:02:05,125
- And you have to live like that.
- No sex?

337
01:02:05,166 --> 01:02:08,041
And we live happily like that.
I was just making sure.

338
01:02:08,083 --> 01:02:10,792
Is your life controlled
by someone else higher

339
01:02:10,793 --> 01:02:13,500
than yourself?

340
01:02:13,541 --> 01:02:15,083
There's no master.

341
01:02:15,125 --> 01:02:16,750
We have a teacher.

342
01:02:16,791 --> 01:02:18,458
I call it a master.

343
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:20,916
Some people… Some people call him master.

344
01:02:20,958 --> 01:02:24,541
'Cause he's very, you
know, kind of like, um…

345
01:02:24,583 --> 01:02:26,750
You know Yoda in<i> Star Wars?</i>

346
01:02:27,041 --> 01:02:28,708
He's a little bit like that.

347
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,708
Everybody ready? I don't wanna lose nobody.

348
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:49,708
I don't wanna lose nobody.

349
01:03:14,375 --> 01:03:17,833
Now, let's have the brothers sing "Ahh."

350
01:03:17,875 --> 01:03:21,458
<i>♪ Ahh ♪</i>

351
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:22,666
And the sisters…

352
01:03:22,708 --> 01:03:24,125
<i>♪ Eeh ♪</i>

353
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:34,416
That's almost in tune.

354
01:03:34,458 --> 01:03:38,125
It's much nicer, okay Almost in tune.

355
01:03:38,166 --> 01:03:39,646
<i>…a guided meditation</i>

356
01:03:39,647 --> 01:03:41,125
<i>on the stage</i>

357
01:03:41,166 --> 01:03:43,125
<i>in about five or six minutes,</i>

358
01:03:43,166 --> 01:03:46,833
<i>so you've been asked
to come upstairs for that.</i>

359
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,291
<i>I knew early on</i>

360
01:04:40,333 --> 01:04:44,041
<i>that finding truth is not
the same as finding happiness.</i>

361
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:48,708
<i>You aspire to see the truth.</i>

362
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:51,666
<i>But once you have seen it,</i>

363
01:04:51,708 --> 01:04:54,208
<i>you cannot avoid suffering.</i>

364
01:04:55,833 --> 01:04:59,000
<i>Otherwise, you have seen nothing at all.</i>

365
01:05:36,375 --> 01:05:37,583
I've seen him.

366
01:05:37,625 --> 01:05:40,583
I only get over here once every other year

367
01:05:40,625 --> 01:05:43,875
'cause I live in France in a monastery.

368
01:05:43,916 --> 01:05:46,541
And so I only have the opportunity

369
01:05:46,583 --> 01:05:48,562
to see my dad and my family
here in the States

370
01:05:48,563 --> 01:05:50,541
every other year.

371
01:05:50,583 --> 01:05:52,583
- Well, I'm glad you're here.
- Yeah.

372
01:05:52,625 --> 01:05:55,458
- I feel very lucky, 'cause
some of my monastic - brothers and sisters

373
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:58,458
Don't get to see
their relatives that often.

374
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:01,458
Stay to your left.

375
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:03,416
To your left.

376
01:06:03,458 --> 01:06:05,041
To your left.

377
01:06:08,875 --> 01:06:10,750
This is my dad.

378
01:06:10,791 --> 01:06:12,791
Hey, baby doll.

379
01:06:12,833 --> 01:06:14,958
Dang.

380
01:06:17,166 --> 01:06:20,125
He cries… He cries every time he's happy.

381
01:06:21,875 --> 01:06:24,833
Bless you, Lord. Bless you, Lord.

382
01:06:28,666 --> 01:06:31,125
Give me a hug, man. You can lean on me.

383
01:06:31,166 --> 01:06:33,958
You can lean on me.

384
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,166
Oh, Lord.

385
01:06:35,208 --> 01:06:36,750
It must have been… That's right.

386
01:06:36,791 --> 01:06:39,375
It's been more than a month of Sundays.

387
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:45,916
Surprise, surprise.

388
01:06:45,958 --> 01:06:47,625
Surprise. You look
like you're 19 years old.

389
01:06:47,666 --> 01:06:49,375
I am 19. I am 19.

390
01:06:51,166 --> 01:06:52,416
Is that right? You look good.

391
01:06:52,458 --> 01:06:53,666
You shave?

392
01:06:53,708 --> 01:06:56,625
I shave just like you shave.

393
01:06:56,666 --> 01:06:59,583
- I shave every couple… well,
about three weeks - or so.

394
01:06:59,625 --> 01:07:02,041
Is that right? You look good.

395
01:07:02,083 --> 01:07:04,333
- Well, you know, I cut my hair back
- every year.

396
01:07:04,375 --> 01:07:05,438
Take your hat off, Daddy.

397
01:07:05,439 --> 01:07:06,500
Let me see your head.

398
01:07:06,541 --> 01:07:07,750
How's your head? Oh!

399
01:07:07,791 --> 01:07:09,125
Oh!

400
01:07:09,166 --> 01:07:12,791
Look at you. He got
a haircut too, huh, man?

401
01:07:12,833 --> 01:07:14,666
Look at that.

402
01:07:14,708 --> 01:07:16,666
My head gettin' cold.

403
01:07:16,708 --> 01:07:18,708
Okay. No, I was just kiddin'.

404
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:20,458
Yeah. It looks good there.

405
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:22,166
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

406
01:07:22,208 --> 01:07:24,458
- You wanna sit up a little better?
- Yeah, you all right?

407
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:26,875

01:07:28,208 --> 01:07:29,791
Yeah. Yeah.

01:07:29,833 --> 01:07:32,041
- I get to sit here and hold your hand.
- That's right.

411
01:07:32,083 --> 01:07:33,250
Huh?

412
01:07:33,291 --> 01:07:35,666
Look what I brought you.

413
01:07:35,708 --> 01:07:37,833
Trick or treat. Trick or treat.

414
01:07:37,875 --> 01:07:40,333
Yeah, the trick or treat. Trick or treat.

415
01:07:40,375 --> 01:07:43,666
Jacqui, do some of your breathing
with your dad.

416
01:07:43,708 --> 01:07:46,083
Okay, man.

417
01:07:46,125 --> 01:07:49,708
Just breathe. Reconnect with your body.

418
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:52,042
Breathing in and breathing out

419
01:07:52,043 --> 01:07:54,333
with a lot of gratitude.

420
01:07:54,375 --> 01:07:56,125
Breathing in.

421
01:07:56,166 --> 01:07:58,458
Breathing out with joy.

422
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:00,041
Breathing in.

423
01:08:00,083 --> 01:08:01,375
Yeah.

424
01:08:01,416 --> 01:08:04,416
It's all right.

425
01:08:04,458 --> 01:08:05,791
It's all right.

426
01:08:05,833 --> 01:08:09,708
Breathing out and release all that joy.

427
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:12,666
It's been pent up for how many years?

428
01:08:12,708 --> 01:08:15,416
Let all that joy come out.

429
01:08:16,625 --> 01:08:18,541
Praise the Lord. That's right. Yeah.

430
01:08:18,791 --> 01:08:21,000
Thank you, Lord.

431
01:08:21,041 --> 01:08:23,291
That's great.

432
01:08:23,333 --> 01:08:25,541
Praise the Lord.

433
01:08:25,583 --> 01:08:27,375
The last couple of times I've come

434
01:08:27,416 --> 01:08:31,041
that there hasn't been that smile.

435
01:08:31,083 --> 01:08:32,166
Breathe out.

436
01:08:32,208 --> 01:08:33,750
Breathing in

437
01:08:33,791 --> 01:08:35,583
and breathing out

438
01:08:35,625 --> 01:08:38,125
and releasing the tension.

439
01:08:39,125 --> 01:08:40,875
Breathing in.

440
01:08:42,125 --> 01:08:43,500
Releasing.

441
01:08:43,541 --> 01:08:46,041
That's good.

442
01:08:46,083 --> 01:08:48,750
You can remember to come
back to your body like this

443
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:52,000
every time you get
a little overwhelmed, huh?

444
01:08:52,041 --> 01:08:53,875
Even though when it's happy.

445
01:09:03,583 --> 01:09:05,333
Lord, have mercy.

446
01:09:07,375 --> 01:09:08,625
Say "thank you."

447
01:09:08,666 --> 01:09:10,666
Thank you, Lord.

448
01:09:13,583 --> 01:09:16,208
We're lucky too, you know.
It's not just you.

449
01:09:16,250 --> 01:09:19,000
We're lucky that we still got you around.

450
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:34,375
Yes.

451
01:09:37,916 --> 01:09:42,208
Lord, have mercy… mercy on my soul.

452
01:09:43,125 --> 01:09:44,416
On my soul.

453
01:09:44,458 --> 01:09:47,291
Happy moment, huh

454
01:09:47,333 --> 01:09:49,666
A happy moment. Is this
a happy moment or what?

455
01:09:49,708 --> 01:09:51,375
Yes, it is. Huh?

456
01:09:51,416 --> 01:09:55,125
Happy… Is this a happy moment or what?

457
01:09:55,166 --> 01:09:57,166
- Lord, have mercy on my soul.
- Or what?

458
01:09:57,208 --> 01:09:58,416
Yep.

459
01:09:58,458 --> 01:09:59,833
Lord, have mercy on my soul.

460
01:09:59,875 --> 01:10:03,750
This is the kingdom of heaven
right here now. Isn't it?

461
01:10:03,791 --> 01:10:05,916
Who says you have to go anywhere?

462
01:10:05,958 --> 01:10:08,250
Heaven is right here, isn't it?

463
01:10:08,291 --> 01:10:10,416
Huh? Right here.

464
01:10:11,583 --> 01:10:13,250
It's right here, isn't it?

465
01:10:13,291 --> 01:10:15,166
Mm-hmm.

466
01:10:15,208 --> 01:10:17,041
Right here.

467
01:10:17,083 --> 01:10:20,291
Right here with all of us.

468
01:10:20,333 --> 01:10:22,083
All of us. All of us.

469
01:10:22,125 --> 01:10:24,083
Thank the Lord. Mm-hmm.

470
01:10:24,125 --> 01:10:26,083
And they're on their cell phones.

471
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:32,041
Yeah.

472
01:10:32,083 --> 01:10:33,666
Okay.

473
01:10:33,708 --> 01:10:37,000
Where's your tissue? Get
another tissue for him.

474
01:10:47,208 --> 01:10:49,625
Mmm.

475
01:11:53,375 --> 01:11:55,208
Oop.

476
01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:01,791
Hold still. There you go.

477
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:07,666
Okay? Yeah.

478
01:12:07,708 --> 01:12:09,375
I'll help you get out the door.

479
01:12:22,666 --> 01:12:24,333
You working up a sweat?

480
01:12:35,416 --> 01:12:38,416
Do you work this hard when
you're on your own at home?

481
01:12:38,458 --> 01:12:40,458
Ah! I'm retired.

482
01:12:43,583 --> 01:12:47,291
One of the beauties of being retired.

483
01:12:47,333 --> 01:12:49,375
You don't have to work as hard.

484
01:12:50,916 --> 01:12:53,833
So this is the way you used to work.

485
01:12:53,875 --> 01:12:56,000
More or less, yeah.

486
01:12:56,041 --> 01:12:57,937
We didn't have you singing the song with us

487
01:12:57,938 --> 01:12:59,833
at the beginning.

488
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:01,625
It goes in the workplace…

489
01:13:01,666 --> 01:13:02,666
It goes…

490
01:13:02,708 --> 01:13:05,875
<i>♪ In, out ♪</i>

491
01:13:05,916 --> 01:13:09,416
<i>♪ Deep, slow ♪</i>

492
01:13:09,458 --> 01:13:12,125
We got to slow you down.

493
01:13:12,166 --> 01:13:13,750
You know, you remind me of somebody

494
01:13:13,751 --> 01:13:15,333
and I don't know why.

495
01:13:15,375 --> 01:13:16,979
Are you from St. Paul or Minneapolis?

496
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:18,583
Yeah.

497
01:13:18,625 --> 01:13:20,833
What was your name before?

498
01:13:20,875 --> 01:13:24,750
Well, when I was a priest,
it was Father Adrian Stier.

499
01:13:24,791 --> 01:13:28,375
When I was in Dave Gere.

500
01:13:28,416 --> 01:13:30,000
I'll be…

501
01:13:30,041 --> 01:13:31,833
I thought you died.

502
01:13:31,875 --> 01:13:33,750
I thought you died.

503
01:13:33,791 --> 01:13:35,125
Oh, wow.

504
01:13:35,166 --> 01:13:36,750
Dave Gere.

505
01:13:36,791 --> 01:13:38,791
How about this?

506
01:13:38,833 --> 01:13:40,375
You're a miracle.

507
01:13:41,583 --> 01:13:43,375
You're looking good. Yeah?

508
01:13:43,416 --> 01:13:45,250
Last I heard, you were very sick,

509
01:13:45,291 --> 01:13:48,458
and then I didn't hear
anything for a while.

510
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:49,917
Twenty years ago I had cancer.

511
01:13:49,918 --> 01:13:51,333
Yeah.

512
01:13:51,375 --> 01:13:55,083
And I was in deep chemotherapy. Uh-huh.

513
01:13:55,125 --> 01:13:59,041
- At which time was I first tapped into this program.
- Okay.

514
01:13:59,083 --> 01:14:01,458
And when I was in chemotherapy,

515
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:03,500
I happened to read my partner's copy

516
01:14:03,501 --> 01:14:05,500
of<i> The Miracle of Mindfulness.</i>

517
01:14:05,541 --> 01:14:07,083
Yeah. Yeah.

518
01:14:07,125 --> 01:14:08,750
How about this?

519
01:14:08,791 --> 01:14:10,771
We worked together in the Hampton County

520
01:14:10,772 --> 01:14:12,750
Court Services.

521
01:14:12,791 --> 01:14:15,041
Yeah. Yeah. Probation. Yeah.

522
01:14:15,083 --> 01:14:17,458
Yeah. Working with criminals.

523
01:14:21,208 --> 01:14:24,083
- You just looked… There was something
- about your face.

524
01:14:24,125 --> 01:14:26,042
I said, "I know who he is, but I can't put"

525
01:14:26,043 --> 01:14:27,958
a name to it."

526
01:14:29,541 --> 01:14:32,333
Good seeing you. Good seeing you, Dave.

527
01:14:32,375 --> 01:14:34,625
Wow. This is wonderful.

528
01:14:34,666 --> 01:14:37,541
We shall visit more in this week here.

529
01:14:37,583 --> 01:14:39,875
Okay. Okay. Good.

530
01:15:00,333 --> 01:15:02,791
I have a question. Yes?

531
01:15:02,833 --> 01:15:06,333
I'm with a sound therapy organization.

532
01:15:06,375 --> 01:15:08,791
My question really was:

533
01:15:08,833 --> 01:15:12,083
If silence is the pathway

534
01:15:12,125 --> 01:15:17,416
to mindfulness and awakening,

535
01:15:17,458 --> 01:15:20,166
what is the purpose of sound?

536
01:15:20,208 --> 01:15:22,833
And what is sacred sound?

537
01:15:22,875 --> 01:15:25,708
Well, silence can be thunderous.

538
01:15:27,041 --> 01:15:29,250
Yeah. True.

539
01:15:29,291 --> 01:15:31,750
You know that… Just like a black color

540
01:15:31,791 --> 01:15:34,541
is the absorption of all colors,

541
01:15:34,583 --> 01:15:37,916
so silence can absorb all sounds.

542
01:15:37,958 --> 01:15:40,708
It's a great sound… sacred sound.

543
01:15:40,750 --> 01:15:45,750
So in our practice, we practice
that deep silence within,

544
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:48,625
of the mind, of all the perceptions,

545
01:15:48,666 --> 01:15:52,708
the thoughts and also
the quietness of the body,

546
01:15:52,750 --> 01:15:57,000
so there's solidity, stability.

547
01:15:57,041 --> 01:15:59,500
Spaciousness is the foundation,

548
01:15:59,541 --> 01:16:02,750
and that's where other sounds can arise.

549
01:16:02,791 --> 01:16:05,312
If we are always in chaos or moving around,

550
01:16:05,313 --> 01:16:07,833
those are just noise.

551
01:16:07,875 --> 01:16:09,750
That's not sacred sound.

552
01:16:12,250 --> 01:16:14,791
So how would you define sacred sound?

553
01:16:14,833 --> 01:16:18,416
What would sacred sound be

554
01:16:18,458 --> 01:16:21,250
If there is one. I just did.

555
01:16:21,291 --> 01:16:23,562
When you take a step and you're completely

556
01:16:23,563 --> 01:16:25,833
in oneness with Mother Earth

557
01:16:25,875 --> 01:16:29,958
and you don't have the division
between you and Mother Earth,

558
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,208
nature and all that is,

559
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:34,333
that is very deep sound.

560
01:16:36,291 --> 01:16:38,750
And there's no limitation to it.

561
01:16:38,791 --> 01:16:41,750
And from there it can spring a song,

562
01:16:41,791 --> 01:16:44,000
a poem, a smile.

563
01:16:44,041 --> 01:16:46,708
A smile can be a beautiful sound.

564
01:17:43,375 --> 01:17:44,708
Ah.

565
01:20:04,666 --> 01:20:07,000
Hello. Ah, hey.

566
01:20:07,041 --> 01:20:08,541
Have a hug.

567
01:20:08,583 --> 01:20:11,125
Ah, good to see Mummy.

568
01:20:22,916 --> 01:20:24,625
Well… Interesting home.

569
01:20:27,291 --> 01:20:29,375
I thought you said
all the furniture was gone.

570
01:20:29,416 --> 01:20:31,312
Huh? I thought you said

571
01:20:31,313 --> 01:20:33,208
all the furniture was gone.

572
01:20:33,250 --> 01:20:34,791
No, some. Yeah, it's all gone.

573
01:20:36,291 --> 01:20:38,583
Garden is still there.

574
01:20:38,625 --> 01:20:39,958
Garden.

575
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,750
This is my rock garden.

576
01:20:41,791 --> 01:20:45,291
I know there's not much to see today,

577
01:20:45,333 --> 01:20:50,041
but in a month's time,
all the plants will come up.

578
01:20:54,958 --> 01:20:56,750
See?

579
01:20:56,791 --> 01:20:58,250
Oh, to…

580
01:21:00,708 --> 01:21:02,708
Is this my journal?

581
01:21:02,750 --> 01:21:04,916
It's amazing.

582
01:21:04,958 --> 01:21:08,208
Just… Just your drawing book.

583
01:21:15,708 --> 01:21:17,750
That's my… That's my journal.

584
01:21:17,791 --> 01:21:20,208
I show this part, this picture part.

585
01:21:21,458 --> 01:21:23,250
The maps. Right?

586
01:21:31,666 --> 01:21:33,500
Map of Davis's life.

587
01:21:35,541 --> 01:21:37,208
Cool, huh?

588
01:21:39,208 --> 01:21:41,041
Isn't it amazing though?

589
01:21:45,083 --> 01:21:46,791
Oh, my gosh.

590
01:21:46,833 --> 01:21:50,708
This is really… detailed.

591
01:21:52,333 --> 01:21:54,541
"Birth. Seven years old."

592
01:21:54,583 --> 01:21:56,666
Make friends. Be cool.

593
01:21:56,708 --> 01:22:00,750
Join the drama club and be
good at all sports.

594
01:22:00,791 --> 01:22:03,208
Thirteen years old… apply to high school.

595
01:22:04,208 --> 01:22:05,708
Student class president.

596
01:22:05,750 --> 01:22:08,458
Get accepted to all high schools.

597
01:22:09,708 --> 01:22:11,958
In college everyone loves me.

598
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,708
Good student. Founder of three clubs.

599
01:22:14,750 --> 01:22:16,666
Parents proud.

600
01:22:18,375 --> 01:22:22,500
Accepted to Ivy League college
with full scholarship.

601
01:22:22,541 --> 01:22:26,791
Twenty years old… buy $30,000 car.

602
01:22:26,833 --> 01:22:29,041
Twenty-one… get the perfect girlfriend.

603
01:22:31,041 --> 01:22:32,541
Twenty-one… get the perfect…

01:22:32,583 --> 01:22:34,791
Twenty-four… graduate with an MBA.

605
01:22:34,833 --> 01:22:37,125
Get a $300,000 job.

606
01:22:40,666 --> 01:22:44,500
"Twenty-six… get married.
Buy a million-dollar home."

607
01:22:44,541 --> 01:22:46,250
I wondered who planted that idea.

608
01:22:46,291 --> 01:22:48,916
I don't know. You did. Oh,
that's really inspired.

609
01:22:48,958 --> 01:22:50,562
"Thirty…"

610
01:22:50,563 --> 01:22:52,166
Pop out a few children.

611
01:22:52,208 --> 01:22:54,625
Parents super happy.

612
01:22:54,666 --> 01:22:58,791

01:23:05,958 --> 01:23:07,916
"Seventy… obtain enlightenment."

616
01:23:11,166 --> 01:23:12,396
How are you going to get there

617
01:23:12,397 --> 01:23:13,625
with all that?

618
01:23:13,666 --> 01:23:15,250
It's a busy life.

619
01:23:15,291 --> 01:23:18,375
Everything obviously goes
directly as planned, so…

620
01:23:45,541 --> 01:23:48,000
- Okay, we're gonna sing you a song.
- Oh, you don't have to.

621
01:23:48,041 --> 01:23:50,750
No, no, no. It's okay. It goes like this.

01:23:50,791 --> 01:23:55,083

Thank you.

635
01:24:31,291 --> 01:24:32,875
Thank you. That's okay.

636
01:24:32,916 --> 01:24:35,083
This has been very good.
Thank you very much.

637
01:24:35,125 --> 01:24:37,916
Glad you enjoyed it. Have a good day.

638
01:24:37,958 --> 01:24:39,416
Thank you!

639
01:24:39,458 --> 01:24:42,083
This tops it, man. Thank you so much.

640
01:24:42,125 --> 01:24:44,083
I haven't done this in 60-some years.

641
01:24:44,125 --> 01:24:45,958
Really?

642
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,458
Have a good day.

643
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:12,291
Wow!

644
01:25:16,250 --> 01:25:17,916
They're coming for your food.

645
01:25:19,208 --> 01:25:20,916
Oh, that's beautiful.

646
01:25:20,958 --> 01:25:22,458
Look at that.

647
01:25:49,875 --> 01:25:54,458
<i>At that moment, I felt perfectly at peace.</i>

648
01:25:55,833 --> 01:26:00,000
<i>Not one sad or anxious
thought entered my mind.</i>

649
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:08,916
<i>Ideas of past, present
and future dissolved.</i>

650
01:26:10,291 --> 01:26:12,875
<i>And I was standing
at the luminous threshold</i>

651
01:26:12,916 --> 01:26:16,750
<i>of a reality that transcends time,</i>

652
01:26:16,791 --> 01:26:19,458
<i>space and action.</i>

653
01:26:40,333 --> 01:26:44,875
<i>I arose and sat in meditation
the rest of the night.</i>

654
01:26:53,291 --> 01:26:57,708
<i>All that remained
was a deeply rooted peace.</i>

655
01:27:11,375 --> 01:27:13,541
<i>I sat like a mountain…</i>

656
01:27:14,625 --> 01:27:16,541
<i>and I smiled.</i>
