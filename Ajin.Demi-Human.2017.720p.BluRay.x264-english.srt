"Ajin" means a person who cannot die
Call the new mankind

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,531
No matter how hard I try
I just die temporarily.

4
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:21,936
It has the feature to reproduce again

5
00:00:24,184 --> 00:00:27,122
It was first discovered in Africa 26 years ago

00:00:27,591 --> 00:00:30,894
Currently, 46 people are identified worldwide

7
00:00:31,801 --> 00:00:35,172
The Japanese government established the Ain management committee

8
00:00:35,608 --> 00:00:39,139
I have been studying to solve the mystery.

- Yeah
- Yeah

18
00:01:24,212 --> 00:01:25,739
I have a ringer.

19
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:27,041
Examine the sample

20
00:01:30,792 --> 00:01:31,624
I'll cut it.

21
00:01:40,246 --> 00:01:41,613
The heart rate is three times

22
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,283
Reduction of bleeding 50

I would like 30 times

00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:48,455
Yeah

26
00:01:49,466 --> 00:01:51,436
Sample of blood enters the emotions

27
00:01:52,772 --> 00:01:53,763
Cutting is done.

28
00:01:55,011 --> 00:01:56,411
Next, cut the legs

29
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,420
What are the individual differences with 002

30
00:01:59,921 --> 00:02:02,188

32
00:02:05,132 --> 00:02:06,397
There is no big difference.

33
00:02:06,435 --> 00:02:06,833
Yeah

34
00:02:10,911 --> 00:02:12,175
No change.

35
00:02:12,214 --> 00:02:14,447
Decreases by 38

36
00:02:15,621 --> 00:02:16,612

Or

39
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,983
When do you do it?

Reset is complete

41
00:02:34,094 --> 00:02:35,325
Cut the left shoulder

42
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,459
What are you doing?

43
00:02:40,374 --> 00:02:42,402
Since when did you...

44
00:02:47,857 --> 00:02:49,850
Call an ambulance!

45
00:02:51,198 --> 00:02:52,291
What's up?

46
00:02:53,669 --> 00:02:54,638
Something's weird.

47
00:02:55,106 --> 00:02:57,407
I just want to live quietly.

48
00:02:57,444 --> 00:02:59,175
What, is he dead?

49
00:02:59,248 --> 00:03:00,216
Aren't you?

50
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,177
Ajin

51
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:02,586
I need to take a picture.

52
00:03:03,323 --> 00:03:04,052
Ajin

53
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,721
Ajin is ajin!

54
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:09,898
why me?..

55
00:03:09,937 --> 00:03:10,666
Reset it.

56
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:21,728
Ajin

57
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:28,505
<i>About 1 pm this afternoon,
In the streets of Nakagawa City ..</i>

<i>Ajin is protected</i>

00:03:31,617 --> 00:03:34,817
<i>On this Ajin's discovery
The world is paying attention</i>

61
00:03:34,857 --> 00:03:36,995
<i>It's Ajin to hit a truck.</i>

62
00:03:36,995 --> 00:03:39,523
<i>Nagai lives an ordinary life</i>

63
00:03:39,568 --> 00:03:41,800
<i>This ability to learn alone</i>

64
00:03:45,914 --> 00:03:48,682
Experiment 003
Nagai 26 years old

65
00:03:49,589 --> 00:03:52,687
Kyoto University Hospital
Working in the family,

66
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,763
Mother and one sister

67
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:59,401
In a traffic accident three days ago
It is witnessed to regeneration after death.

68
00:04:00,178 --> 00:04:01,237
It turned out to be Ajin.

69
00:04:04,521 --> 00:04:06,252
It's not a good feeling.

70
00:04:06,825 --> 00:04:07,452
Yeah

71
00:04:08,963 --> 00:04:13,269
Ajin is the key to human evolution
To be a valuable being

72
00:04:15,677 --> 00:04:16,976
Do you remember work two years ago?

73
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:19,277
The expense is full.

74
00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:28,331
The reaction is weak.

75
00:04:30,342 --> 00:04:31,208
Reset it.

76
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:32,307
- Yeah
- Yeah

77
00:04:38,192 --> 00:04:39,662
You're in the meeting room.

78
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:40,957
This is it.

79
00:04:43,604 --> 00:04:49,243
<i>Nagai-kai is protected
It's in front of Ajin Lab.</i>

80
00:04:50,953 --> 00:04:51,613
Tozaki

81
00:04:52,189 --> 00:04:52,986
Do you understand?

82
00:04:54,026 --> 00:04:58,798
Three of them are being protected.
The people believe so.

83
00:05:00,707 --> 00:05:04,739
If this experiment is open to the public

84
00:05:06,586 --> 00:05:07,953
Of course I know

85
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,786
What you need to worry about is

86
00:05:21,017 --> 00:05:24,183
I'm your grip. Tanaka-kun

87
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:25,926
Yes

88
00:05:26,796 --> 00:05:27,525
What's up!

89
00:05:27,831 --> 00:05:29,392
Check it out!

90
00:05:30,838 --> 00:05:31,806
I beg your pardon.

91
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,403
Just leave it to me.

92
00:05:37,051 --> 00:05:38,953
An intruder! An intruder!

93
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,105
<i>It's been a while.</i>

94
00:05:47,774 --> 00:05:51,943
<i>Here comes Tanaka.
I rescued you.</i>

95
00:05:52,383 --> 00:05:53,910
<i>Three years or so?</i>

96
00:05:55,691 --> 00:05:57,992
<i>Are you there? Tozaki</i>

97
00:05:59,031 --> 00:06:00,660
Take the people to the safe room.

98
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:02,367
Okay

99
00:06:02,873 --> 00:06:04,741
<i>I came to the Nagai Islands.</i>

100
00:06:06,447 --> 00:06:07,040
right

101
00:06:07,884 --> 00:06:12,349
<i>Tonight's situation in Japan
It's going to be very different.</i>

102
00:06:13,462 --> 00:06:14,898
<i>That's what I declare.</i>

103
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,830
Establish guard to block passage

104
00:06:18,807 --> 00:06:19,798
For intruders

105
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,446
Allow the use of lethal anesthetics

106
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,211
It captures after fortune.

107
00:06:33,271 --> 00:06:34,033
come!

108
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:50,938
Go!

109
00:07:16,931 --> 00:07:18,162
I'm sleepy.

110
00:07:44,857 --> 00:07:45,552
Hit

111
00:08:00,858 --> 00:08:01,519
I got it.

112
00:08:17,827 --> 00:08:18,818
Tanaka Tanaka

113
00:08:19,631 --> 00:08:20,690
How's it going?

114
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:22,198
Absolutely

115
00:08:24,174 --> 00:08:25,234
It's not going to work.

116
00:08:33,594 --> 00:08:35,564
Good to see you.

117
00:08:43,983 --> 00:08:44,644
who?

118
00:08:45,787 --> 00:08:47,279
My name is Sato.

119
00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:49,728
It's like you.

120
00:09:03,324 --> 00:09:05,762
Are you... are you here to rescue me?

121
00:09:08,369 --> 00:09:10,396
At first glance, it looks like twenties.

122
00:09:11,943 --> 00:09:15,041
But you are better than that.
Did you buy a lot more?

123
00:09:17,388 --> 00:09:18,014
Yeah..

124
00:09:18,456 --> 00:09:20,483
I understand that body.

125
00:09:22,097 --> 00:09:24,865
This country lied, breathing.

126
00:09:27,075 --> 00:09:29,205
The government protects Ajin...

127
00:09:31,651 --> 00:09:32,483
And then...

128
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,322
We do not think of us as mice.

129
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,424
Fight together

130
00:09:42,074 --> 00:09:43,669
For Ajin's future

131
00:09:58,308 --> 00:09:59,003
Do not shoot!

132
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:19,915
I'm outta here.

133
00:10:22,694 --> 00:10:23,628
You do it

134
00:10:27,938 --> 00:10:30,170
I gave you pain.

135
00:10:31,078 --> 00:10:32,639
You have the right to kill.

136
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,245
stop

137
00:10:34,485 --> 00:10:37,082
Kill .. right ..

138
00:10:42,202 --> 00:10:43,797
No... Do not shoot!

139
00:10:53,225 --> 00:10:54,217
I'll quit.

140
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,132
because

141
00:10:59,304 --> 00:11:02,767
When I shot these guys,
I thought they were just bothering them.

142
00:11:03,213 --> 00:11:04,113
Then there is no merit.

143
00:11:07,423 --> 00:11:10,054
Yes, you are unique.

144
00:11:13,869 --> 00:11:14,564
why?

145
00:11:15,238 --> 00:11:17,710
I like it a lot to kill.

146
00:11:18,612 --> 00:11:19,671
Childhood

147
00:11:20,316 --> 00:11:22,981
You play with worms?

148
00:11:28,534 --> 00:11:29,730
I'm outta here ..

149
00:11:30,939 --> 00:11:31,771
Sorry

150
00:11:32,476 --> 00:11:35,244
But is it okay?

151
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,020
You are...

152
00:11:42,764 --> 00:11:44,666
You are below expectation!

153
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:48,036
I'll kill you.

154
00:11:54,189 --> 00:11:54,849
Run away!

155
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:18,129
Hide and seek.

156
00:12:22,148 --> 00:12:23,242
I'm outta here.

157
00:12:24,553 --> 00:12:26,284
You'll know.

158
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:32,132
How much human beings
I'm scared and pointless.

159
00:12:33,807 --> 00:12:38,682
Those who have tested you are also at home.
If you go there, you will have loved ones.

160
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:45,524
At first, I thought I should try the Ajin experiment
I accept it, but soon my mind will change.

161
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:51,572
Once you know it's human evolution,
My heart will set.

162
00:12:55,486 --> 00:12:57,047
The human mind

163
00:12:58,058 --> 00:12:59,254
It is weak forever.

164
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,948
I did not forget what you did.

165
00:13:11,553 --> 00:13:13,786
It's the first time I'm escaping here.

166
00:13:17,934 --> 00:13:19,027
Gib and take it

167
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,810
I'll be the bait, you run away.

168
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:25,175
Then mark me the direction to escape.

169
00:13:25,216 --> 00:13:26,480
I'm outta here.

170
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:27,881
but..

171
00:13:29,224 --> 00:13:31,321
Where is it?

172
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,592
It will not be easy.

173
00:13:36,239 --> 00:13:38,176
Okay, that's me.

174
00:13:40,648 --> 00:13:43,120
Kill two of them quickly.

175
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:46,260
I'm outta here.

176
00:13:51,204 --> 00:13:52,264
Do you really?

177
00:13:52,307 --> 00:13:53,673
It will not be good.

178
00:13:54,678 --> 00:13:55,806
I'm outta here.

179
00:14:08,241 --> 00:14:09,368
Is that me?

180
00:14:11,247 --> 00:14:12,444
Are you listening?

181
00:14:22,405 --> 00:14:23,932
I'm sick.

182
00:14:37,102 --> 00:14:39,597
Well, it was not bad.

183
00:14:40,911 --> 00:14:43,645
But the finish is still poor.

184
00:15:56,238 --> 00:15:57,331
It's good.

185
00:15:59,445 --> 00:16:02,646
Congratulations on your first reset

186
00:16:14,911 --> 00:16:17,076
What are you doing? He's coming!

187
00:16:17,116 --> 00:16:19,109
I can not help it. It's a promise.

188
00:16:19,721 --> 00:16:20,951
Post the remaining expenses

189
00:16:25,133 --> 00:16:26,226
You are here.

190
00:16:30,711 --> 00:16:32,078
Someone will keep me.

191
00:16:35,355 --> 00:16:36,187
Okay

203
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,606
This is Ajin's ability.

It's Iya. It's good.

If this is the press
I can not act like this.

238
00:22:00,047 --> 00:22:04,819
To the people today
I have something to say.

239
00:22:07,262 --> 00:22:08,925
My name is Sato

240
00:22:09,968 --> 00:22:10,629
It's 'Ajin'.

241
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:11,661
Ajin ?!

242
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,170
There are three people in Korea.

243

Are not you promised protection?

251
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:43,708
It's just surface.
The reality is totally different.

Developed a new drug

262
00:23:25,896 --> 00:23:28,767

I had to continue.

263
00:23:29,739 --> 00:23:34,244
The evidence is all on my website
I uploaded it to 'AJIN.COM'

264
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:37,179

But, I feel pain.

I can not allow you to act.

Our wish is one.

272
00:24:14,266 --> 00:24:19,233
Give Ajin the citizenship
To designate a special autonomous district

273
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:22,611
Please

274
00:24:24,222 --> 00:24:26,192

00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:43,541
<i>For government manipulation of public opinion</i>

378
00:33:44,282 --> 00:33:46,184
<i>It is judged to be a CG composite image</i>

379
00:33:52,232 --> 00:33:53,132
That ghost ..

380
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,210
How do I get out?

381
00:34:06,329 --> 00:34:07,092
It came out.

382
00:34:09,937 --> 00:34:13,707
M4 carbine in 10 tablets
50 magazines

383
00:34:14,814 --> 00:34:16,283
Be thrilled

384
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:21,558
This big deal has been a long time.
What are you going to do?

385
00:34:21,628 --> 00:34:22,995
Here's what I promised

386
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:26,372
Ten kidneys and five kidneys

387
00:34:28,911 --> 00:34:30,471
I do not know where I always get it.

388
00:34:31,817 --> 00:34:34,551
How do you get it this way?

389
00:34:35,091 --> 00:34:36,617
You better not know.

390
00:34:36,961 --> 00:34:38,259
I do not want to know

391
00:34:38,865 --> 00:34:40,995
I hope you do not know.

392
00:34:45,713 --> 00:34:48,013
If we pick out a weed, it'll fly again.

393
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:50,050
You can just leave it.

394
00:34:50,757 --> 00:34:52,785
I do not even have time to do it.

395
00:34:53,262 --> 00:34:54,732
That's a guy.

396
00:34:56,603 --> 00:34:57,435
is that so

397
00:34:57,939 --> 00:34:59,534
Do not fret

398
00:35:16,513 --> 00:35:18,039
What should we do next?

399
00:35:25,899 --> 00:35:29,738
<i>In the hospital,
A member of</i>

400
00:35:30,041 --> 00:35:33,748
<i>Nagai-kei kin
It was reported to be hospitalized.</i>

401
00:35:33,749 --> 00:35:34,444
Eriko

402
00:35:49,583 --> 00:35:53,046
'Come up on the roof'

403
00:36:00,974 --> 00:36:03,104
Are you okay? Looks exhausted.

404
00:36:04,514 --> 00:36:06,075
You were worried.

405
00:36:08,389 --> 00:36:09,323
It's not mine.

406
00:36:11,061 --> 00:36:11,995
I'm sorry.

407
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:19,171
The woman in front of me

408
00:36:22,219 --> 00:36:23,312
Because he was Ajin.

409
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:25,886
I could live.

410
00:36:28,532 --> 00:36:31,197
I will not tell anyone.
I was embarrassed.

411
00:36:33,943 --> 00:36:34,638
Yes

412
00:36:38,554 --> 00:36:40,320
Is your brother Ajin?

413
00:36:43,164 --> 00:36:43,791
Huh

414
00:36:44,934 --> 00:36:46,061
I do not know why.

415
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,471
Why was it cold

416
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,988
What are you going to do now?

417
00:37:02,772 --> 00:37:04,401
I feel like asking from here.

418
00:37:06,848 --> 00:37:08,044
You know

419
00:37:09,085 --> 00:37:11,352
I desperately studied
Into the department of medicine

420
00:37:12,693 --> 00:37:14,254
I was trying to be a real doctor.

421
00:37:15,098 --> 00:37:18,002
I was suddenly a bitch
I'm being chased by strangers.

422
00:37:18,606 --> 00:37:20,372
My life plan is all gone.

423
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,077
What is Ajin?...

424
00:37:27,158 --> 00:37:28,285
Why did I...

425
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:31,861
I still have words.

426
00:37:34,673 --> 00:37:35,698
I was a little funny.

427
00:37:46,231 --> 00:37:48,498
Sato may attack again someday.

428
00:37:50,908 --> 00:37:51,568
Huh

429
00:37:53,547 --> 00:37:55,107
Because the media is loud.

430
00:37:56,887 --> 00:37:58,915
If you stay here, you can not live quietly.

431
00:38:02,065 --> 00:38:03,033
So what do you do

432
00:38:09,815 --> 00:38:10,408
Tanaka-gun

433
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:11,213
Yeah

434
00:38:11,252 --> 00:38:12,186
Are you ready?

435
00:38:13,022 --> 00:38:13,649
Yeah

436
00:38:16,161 --> 00:38:16,754
Start

437
00:38:21,573 --> 00:38:24,877
I see you again.
Nice to meet you, Sato.

438
00:38:26,919 --> 00:38:27,715
then

439
00:38:28,621 --> 00:38:34,226
<i>I have a government
It's already been five days since I requested it.</i>

440
00:38:34,267 --> 00:38:38,003
<i>However,
I did not even come back.</i>

441
00:38:40,046 --> 00:38:43,817
<i>So,
I will.</i>

442
00:38:45,425 --> 00:38:46,621
The content is

443
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:53,367

Destroy the Ministry of Health and Welfare

444
00:38:56,081 --> 00:38:58,678
<i>November 25, 3 pm</i>

445
00:38:59,187 --> 00:39:02,889
<i>This is our first wave.
You better watch out.</i>

446
00:39:04,531 --> 00:39:05,363
<i>And</i>

447
00:39:06,168 --> 00:39:09,106
If you have a heart to share with me

448
00:39:09,809 --> 00:39:11,609
<i>I hope you'll come that day.</i>

449
00:39:12,883 --> 00:39:15,480
<i>Fight together.</i>

450
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:21,191
And humans.

451
00:39:23,305 --> 00:39:25,241
<i>Prepare for shock</i>

452
00:39:35,965 --> 00:39:37,765
It's okay. It's stable.

453
00:39:38,671 --> 00:39:39,400
Thanks

454
00:39:40,175 --> 00:39:42,806
He was your doctor.

455
00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:44,582
He's still an apprentice.

456
00:39:44,617 --> 00:39:47,282
It's great.

457
00:39:48,525 --> 00:39:50,086
It looks different

458
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:54,996
Thank you very much

459
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,374
It's okay.

460
00:39:58,279 --> 00:40:02,653
A beautiful granddaughter
It feels like it.

461
00:40:05,495 --> 00:40:09,130
It'll be cold in the thick
I'll get you some clothes.

462
00:40:12,677 --> 00:40:13,508
He's a good person.

463
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:19,049
I've been walking a long time.

464
00:40:20,093 --> 00:40:21,118
I need you to fast down today.

465
00:40:33,221 --> 00:40:37,162
My brother healed my illness.

466
00:40:37,864 --> 00:40:39,459
So I'm trying to be a doctor.

467
00:40:41,405 --> 00:40:42,567
then..

468
00:40:44,144 --> 00:40:49,247
Unlike the real thing
There's a warm part.

469
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:58,234
I'm sure you'll get better.

470
00:41:01,681 --> 00:41:02,342
Yeah

471
00:41:17,215 --> 00:41:17,978
Hey, ghost

472
00:41:20,121 --> 00:41:21,021
Ask this

473
00:41:28,171 --> 00:41:29,264
Is that so

474
00:41:30,677 --> 00:41:31,577
No...

475
00:41:44,907 --> 00:41:46,775
You bring me

476
00:41:51,988 --> 00:41:55,360
<i>Sato Ajin Research Institute
He's the one who made it.</i>

477
00:41:55,429 --> 00:42:01,136
<i>Sato and Tanaka then went to Nakai
Likely to have made a colleague</i>

478
00:42:02,846 --> 00:42:04,337
Pick this up.

479
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:09,092
Pick up

480
00:42:23,222 --> 00:42:26,821
I'll be back someday.

481
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,324
What are you doing ..

482
00:42:42,797 --> 00:42:44,232
What is that guy ..

483
00:42:52,485 --> 00:42:53,385
That house.

484
00:43:12,861 --> 00:43:14,490
It is listed in the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare

485
00:43:14,532 --> 00:43:17,061
3 pm is coming soon ..

486
00:43:17,104 --> 00:43:19,876
It's the time that they decided to destroy

487
00:43:19,876 --> 00:43:21,903
It's about 3 o'clock in the afternoon.

488
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:26,422
Police and gentlemen are strict
I'm packing expenses.

489
00:43:26,456 --> 00:43:27,948
I do not see any movement

490
00:43:27,993 --> 00:43:32,697
Today, outsiders are completely blocked
Only the person concerned enters.

491
00:43:32,736 --> 00:43:34,103
The weather is sunny.

492
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:35,871
It was from Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare

493
00:43:36,645 --> 00:43:37,077
Hello

494
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:38,405
Hello

495
00:43:42,491 --> 00:43:43,857
This report was from

00:43:52,412 --> 00:43:55,612
<i>Soon to be</i>

<i>Please see any motion
There is not</i>

499
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,672
Thank you.
Are you okay?

500
00:44:10,083 --> 00:44:11,553
You said it was okay.

501
00:44:12,121 --> 00:44:14,388
Ajin horses
What can I do?

502
00:44:14,426 --> 00:44:15,223
But...

503
00:44:15,895 --> 00:44:16,624
Good.

504
00:44:19,036 --> 00:44:19,765
Secretary...

505
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:25,246
It's an airplane!

506
00:44:25,282 --> 00:44:26,843
The plane is now in labor!

507
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:41,348
The plane crashed into the building!

508
00:44:41,918 --> 00:44:43,319
You guys run away!

509
00:44:45,792 --> 00:44:46,658
run!

510
00:44:56,716 --> 00:45:01,181
<i>The plane just crashed into Labor.</i>

511
00:45:02,796 --> 00:45:06,327
<i>Something dangerous has happened.
Currently, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare</i>

512
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:09,673
<i>I can not reach you.</i>

513
00:45:09,711 --> 00:45:11,613
What is the matter?

514
00:45:23,406 --> 00:45:25,536
Thriller

515
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:29,184
The thrill of the plane is fun.

516
00:45:33,528 --> 00:45:36,865
I broke it.

517
00:46:09,872 --> 00:46:11,638
Wait for me.

518
00:46:11,676 --> 00:46:13,042
Did you really do it?

519
00:46:13,413 --> 00:46:16,647
You came here.
I was moved.

520
00:46:19,426 --> 00:46:21,054
There you are.

521
00:46:22,098 --> 00:46:23,430
Welcome party

522
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:26,898
This is not the end.

523
00:46:32,854 --> 00:46:33,651
Arrive at 2 minutes

524
00:46:38,333 --> 00:46:39,130
then

525
00:46:39,736 --> 00:46:42,834
This country's top troops
Is it self-defense?

526
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:44,410
No wrong

527
00:46:45,448 --> 00:46:48,911
I have never experienced
The ones that do not exist are out of the question.

528
00:46:49,991 --> 00:46:50,982
If so, then ..

529
00:46:51,894 --> 00:46:53,763
Special Officer of the Metropolitan Police Department

530
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:59,567
First of all,
Elite troops to mobilize

531
00:46:59,611 --> 00:47:01,411
Known as 'S.A.T'

532
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,556
<i>I'll get back to you later.</i>

533
00:47:06,326 --> 00:47:08,126
<i>Then the next news</i>

534
00:47:08,463 --> 00:47:09,488
<i>Fellow citizens</i>

535
00:47:10,668 --> 00:47:13,163
I'll show you my heart.

536
00:47:14,243 --> 00:47:16,647
This is the second wave

537
00:47:17,082 --> 00:47:17,879
And..

538
00:47:21,959 --> 00:47:23,325
<i>I'm outta here.</i>

539
00:47:24,598 --> 00:47:25,623
<i>Are you looking?</i>

540
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:28,936
<i>Watch it carefully.</i>

541
00:47:29,809 --> 00:47:31,746
<i>The power of Ajin</i>

542
00:47:36,223 --> 00:47:36,986
character,

00:47:39,396 --> 00:47:40,991
S.A.T Will you start your first fight

544
00:47:42,236 --> 00:47:44,002
Start operation

545
00:47:44,073 --> 00:47:44,699
launch

546
00:47:48,516 --> 00:47:49,882
Advance each squad

547
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,071
Secure target

548
00:48:05,452 --> 00:48:07,388
Sato is killing before he gets resurrected.

549
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:11,329
I ordered

550
00:48:13,269 --> 00:48:15,638
If you can not kill
Can not be resurrected

551
00:48:16,876 --> 00:48:18,038
We are free from freedom.

552
00:48:18,847 --> 00:48:19,644
Yeah

553
00:48:24,425 --> 00:48:25,622
2nd squad shoots forward

554
00:48:39,525 --> 00:48:40,219
It's a sniper!

555
00:48:41,295 --> 00:48:43,322
I do not have a hunch about shooting.

556
00:48:44,335 --> 00:48:46,032
At 7 o'clock 7 o'clock, the sniper

557
00:49:10,156 --> 00:49:11,056
Good morning

558
00:49:21,781 --> 00:49:22,510
Slow

559
00:49:57,824 --> 00:49:58,850
- hurry
- Go ahead.

560
00:51:00,191 --> 00:51:01,318
Pretty much.

561
00:51:21,603 --> 00:51:23,597
Mr. Sato, you're not completely human.

562
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:28,015
Well, it's because he's a boy.

563
00:51:43,851 --> 00:51:46,083

01:20:07,751 --> 01:20:08,742
wait

933
01:20:15,066 --> 01:20:16,262
This is all done.

934
01:20:16,903 --> 01:20:20,502
Mr. Hirasawa, I'll leave it to the rest.

935
01:20:21,948 --> 01:20:22,574
Leave it to me.

936
01:20:29,831 --> 01:20:31,231
Let's go here.

937
01:20:31,267 --> 01:20:31,826
Yeah

938
01:20:32,804 --> 01:20:33,431
Good

939
01:20:36,011 --> 01:20:36,409
It is now

940
01:20:36,813 --> 01:20:37,713
Turn the fan on.

941
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:39,650
Yeah

942
01:20:42,625 --> 01:20:43,457
What?

943
01:20:44,462 --> 01:20:45,396
What is this ?!

944
01:20:45,632 --> 01:20:46,566
Ajinu powder ?!

945
01:20:48,103 --> 01:20:48,900
Nagai ?!

946
01:20:52,112 --> 01:20:54,014
The ghost can only be seen by Ajin.

947
01:20:54,884 --> 01:20:55,579
In such a large amount

948
01:20:55,619 --> 01:20:56,678
What ?!

949
01:20:57,090 --> 01:20:57,887
Tanaka!

950
01:20:58,592 --> 01:21:00,062
What is visible?

951
01:21:00,664 --> 01:21:02,133
I do not see it!

952
01:21:06,542 --> 01:21:08,137
The attack is coming!

953
01:21:08,481 --> 01:21:09,175
Take care of Takahashi!

954
01:21:13,057 --> 01:21:14,184
Garbage!

955
01:21:17,833 --> 01:21:19,530
Dangerous

956
01:21:20,439 --> 01:21:22,809
run! Takahashi! This way!

957
01:21:30,226 --> 01:21:30,750
clear

958
01:21:32,298 --> 01:21:33,858
So far, four people have been destroyed.

959
01:21:35,004 --> 01:21:37,236
But even this time
I do not see Sato.

960
01:21:37,876 --> 01:21:39,505
There is only one entrance to this side.

961
01:21:40,114 --> 01:21:42,586
When you have all your troops on your side,
He can not help it.

962
01:21:49,334 --> 01:21:51,635
Wood shredder

963
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:55,243
I crush the logs by five centimeters.

964
01:21:56,516 --> 01:21:57,211
Good.

965
01:21:58,754 --> 01:21:59,516
Thanks

966
01:22:03,130 --> 01:22:05,100
Is he just a man to sleep

967
01:22:18,263 --> 01:22:21,133
I'll let you know about me.

968
01:22:22,271 --> 01:22:23,741
If Ajin is destroyed

969
01:22:24,174 --> 01:22:28,173
It will play from the biggest flesh

970
01:22:28,919 --> 01:22:31,049
is that so

971
01:22:32,626 --> 01:22:34,153
You'll see a rare sight.

972
01:22:35,232 --> 01:22:38,536
Mr. Spock Transmit

973
01:22:52,970 --> 01:22:53,767
Hello! I'm back

974
01:23:08,403 --> 01:23:09,131
Satoda

975
01:23:09,170 --> 01:23:10,105
Sato showed up.

976
01:23:10,941 --> 01:23:11,465
Yeah?

977
01:23:12,544 --> 01:23:14,036
Come to the office quickly.

978
01:23:15,885 --> 01:23:17,616
What happened?

979
01:23:27,944 --> 01:23:30,678
A hasty man is not popular.

980
01:23:36,697 --> 01:23:37,323
Nagai

981
01:23:37,364 --> 01:23:38,856
I'll send it to you right now.

982
01:23:39,869 --> 01:23:40,735
Our

983
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:42,506
It's a victory.

984
01:23:43,177 --> 01:23:43,872
wake up

985
01:23:48,288 --> 01:23:50,851
That's it.

988

Did you do it?

989
01:24:08,798 --> 01:24:09,857
Wait a minute!

990
01:24:12,072 --> 01:24:13,302
It's okay. It's okay.

991
01:24:19,454 --> 01:24:20,787
He's asleep.

992
01:24:28,306 --> 01:24:29,001
Well

993
01:24:34,854 --> 01:24:35,686
What is happening Hirasawa

994
01:24:37,192 --> 01:24:39,755
Now, let's fight back.

995
01:24:46,679 --> 01:24:47,169
Report

996

Hirasawa

997
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:50,947
Hirasawa!

998
01:25:02,346 --> 01:25:04,407
Sato! How do I...

999
01:25:05,051 --> 01:25:06,417
Amulets helped.

1000
01:25:08,225 --> 01:25:09,056
They are...

1001
01:25:10,129 --> 01:25:10,995
then

1002
01:25:35,282 --> 01:25:37,048
Let's open

1003
01:25:52,786 --> 01:25:55,690
This will change everything.

1004
01:25:58,699 --> 01:26:00,430
It's a lot of excitement.

1005
01:26:03,709 --> 01:26:04,506
I'll be back.

1006
01:26:04,979 --> 01:26:06,072
Is not it going back?

1007
01:26:06,115 --> 01:26:08,017
You've come all the way here.

1008
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:10,012
Enjoy the end roll.

1009
01:26:11,226 --> 01:26:12,194
End roll?

1010
01:26:12,228 --> 01:26:12,991
Tanaka-gun

1011
01:26:13,464 --> 01:26:14,056
Yeah

1012
01:26:15,301 --> 01:26:16,701
I'll take care of it.

1013
01:26:26,425 --> 01:26:27,154
Mr. Hirasawa

1014
01:26:32,872 --> 01:26:33,738
I'll stop.

1015
01:26:39,753 --> 01:26:40,050
Run away

1016
01:26:40,756 --> 01:26:41,724
Do not speak

1017
01:26:44,062 --> 01:26:46,329
Sato guy

1018
01:26:46,367 --> 01:26:47,267
I know.

1019
01:26:50,777 --> 01:26:53,112
If you do not fight...

1020
01:26:55,754 --> 01:26:56,881
Do not tell me!

1021
01:27:00,531 --> 01:27:01,328
And..

1022
01:27:04,773 --> 01:27:06,675
Your life...

1023
01:27:11,387 --> 01:27:12,116
I live.

1024
01:27:31,263 --> 01:27:32,129
Do not be ridiculous

1025
01:27:35,406 --> 01:27:36,602
I wanted to have a toast.

1026
01:27:43,155 --> 01:27:44,215
Wow ~ I'm outta here.

1027
01:27:44,925 --> 01:27:45,757
Are you there?

1028
01:27:47,097 --> 01:27:50,195
The last one is really fateful.

1029
01:27:51,105 --> 01:27:52,096
How did you get here?

1030
01:27:52,842 --> 01:27:55,109
I've given my left hand a charm.

1031
01:27:56,483 --> 01:27:58,887
If you think a little, you'll know.

1032
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:07,965
I got the gas.

1033
01:28:09,144 --> 01:28:11,639
I'll spray it now. Like spraying pesticides.

1034
01:28:11,716 --> 01:28:12,548
Where are you

1035
01:28:13,152 --> 01:28:16,182
Pest control is most effective in the yard.

1036
01:28:17,094 --> 01:28:21,468
I got it by the gas.
I thought Bonus Stage

1037

Shaking

1038
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:26,814
I'm outta here.

1039
01:28:32,393 --> 01:28:33,156
You too.

1040
01:28:36,903 --> 01:28:39,307
The best end roll comes

1041
01:29:06,566 --> 01:29:07,500
Where is Nagai?

1042
01:29:09,372 --> 01:29:09,965
Nagai

1043
01:29:11,143 --> 01:29:13,240
We will request the dispatch of diamond.

1044
01:29:14,884 --> 01:29:18,951
Mr. Tozaki, I'll be waiting for you.

[Top helicopter landing area]

1046
01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:44,180
Excited

1047
01:29:51,529 --> 01:29:54,399
You came here.

1048
01:29:54,468 --> 01:29:55,095
Happy

1049
01:29:55,872 --> 01:29:57,399
The last boss appears.

1050
01:29:57,775 --> 01:29:59,404
You will not be surprised.

1051
01:30:00,581 --> 01:30:02,176
Good.

1052
01:30:03,187 --> 01:30:05,180
Let's start the game

1053
01:30:44,809 --> 01:30:45,470
Yeah

1054
01:30:45,510 --> 01:30:46,444
[Restaurant on the 34th floor]

1055
01:30:46,479 --> 01:30:48,040
Come on!

1056
01:31:07,457 --> 01:31:07,924
Kurochan!

1057
01:31:59,335 --> 01:31:59,928
I meet again.

1058
01:32:17,808 --> 01:32:20,113
Why are you Ajin and sticking over there?

1059
01:32:20,113 --> 01:32:21,377
Neither.

1060
01:32:21,749 --> 01:32:25,018
I thought you guys were right.
You're not doing this.

1061
01:32:38,184 --> 01:32:38,981
I'm outta here.

1062
01:32:41,123 --> 01:32:42,889
What do you think Ajin is

1063
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:47,867
It is a human chosen to evolve.

1064
01:32:49,942 --> 01:32:51,742
How was you before

1065
01:32:53,350 --> 01:32:55,845
The next life of a human being

1066
01:32:56,824 --> 01:32:59,728
How was your life changed by Ajin?

1067
01:33:02,369 --> 01:33:03,532
You now

1068
01:33:04,139 --> 01:33:05,472
It's alive.

1069
01:33:10,353 --> 01:33:11,446
Let's enjoy

1070
01:33:13,259 --> 01:33:16,061
For me, the final wave is you.

1071
01:33:16,399 --> 01:33:17,094
I'm outta here.

1072
01:33:18,504 --> 01:33:20,804
But before that, 'purification'

1073
01:34:03,366 --> 01:34:04,425
That's too bad.

1074
01:35:16,288 --> 01:35:18,259
How long are you going to pretend to be a human?

1075
01:35:20,797 --> 01:35:22,768
While struggling and suffering

1076
01:35:23,704 --> 01:35:25,470
You hate humans too!

1077
01:35:44,548 --> 01:35:48,387
I have one question.

1078
01:35:50,461 --> 01:35:53,435
Why so
Are you on your side?

1079
01:35:56,207 --> 01:35:57,505
Ajin

1080
01:36:00,650 --> 01:36:02,620
You can enjoy it more.

1081
01:36:08,900 --> 01:36:10,096
It's a human or a human being.

1082
01:36:12,274 --> 01:36:13,937
I like that kind of thing.

1083
01:36:15,782 --> 01:36:16,682
I just

1084
01:36:21,393 --> 01:36:23,386
I hate you!

1085
01:36:51,759 --> 01:36:54,993
You are also unique.

1086
01:36:57,170 --> 01:36:58,161
Come on, ghost.

1087
01:37:32,912 --> 01:37:33,505
Shimomura!

1088
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:43,897
Proceed to reset!

1089
01:38:08,622 --> 01:38:10,183
You did not protect me.

1090
01:38:12,363 --> 01:38:13,833
That's not the point.

1091
01:38:15,804 --> 01:38:18,572
Sorry

1092
01:38:24,723 --> 01:38:26,420
Do not leave me.

1093
01:38:47,171 --> 01:38:50,873
How many times...
Can you get it out?

1094
01:40:36,805 --> 01:40:38,571
Now, too

1095
01:40:40,847 --> 01:40:42,578
I was nervous.

1096
01:40:46,359 --> 01:40:48,591
Hey ghosts!

1097
01:40:54,209 --> 01:40:55,336
Come out!

1098
01:41:01,357 --> 01:41:02,416
come out!

1099
01:41:15,354 --> 01:41:17,552
It looks good.

Can not recover
Are you willing to state

1104
01:42:25,971 --> 01:42:27,098
Nagai-ke did it.

1105
01:42:30,347 --> 01:42:35,723
I have Sato as the point of attack of Dia
I ordered you to drive it.

1106
01:42:37,329 --> 01:42:39,698
But he's got this situation.
After you make it

1107
01:42:42,405 --> 01:42:43,897
I want Nagai to take it.

1108
01:42:44,878 --> 01:42:49,013
That's the government
It was a condition to permit.

1109

What's your appointment with Nagai-ke?

1110

I do not know.

It's me!
