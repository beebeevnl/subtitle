00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:34,360
Sorry about that. Back there.

720
00:56:38,630 --> 00:56:41,233
I guess I can't
hide this anymore.

721
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:54,812
Why didn't you tell me?

722
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:57,949
Didn't think it would
make any difference.

723
00:57:02,553 --> 00:57:04,219
All I know is that WICKED
must have put me

724
00:57:04,221 --> 00:57:05,923
in that maze for a reason.

725
00:57:07,324 --> 00:57:08,190
Maybe it was literally

726
00:57:08,192 --> 00:57:09,625
just so they could tell
the difference

727
00:57:09,627 --> 00:57:12,797
between immunes like you
and people like me.

728
00:57:15,699 --> 00:57:17,902
You know we can
still fix this, Newt.

00:57:19,437 --> 00:57:21,136
Okay? We can.

00:57:21,138 --> 00:57:22,770

This is about Minho.

732
00:57:25,243 --> 00:57:26,944
Now he needs us.

733
00:57:28,078 --> 00:57:31,512
So if there is even
the slightest chance

734
00:57:31,514 --> 00:57:33,181
that we can save him,

735
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:36,187
we can get him out of there,
then we have to take that.

736
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:40,792
No matter what the cost.

737
00:57:43,259 --> 00:57:44,828

745
00:58:45,656 --> 00:58:47,525
you're going to save her.

746
00:58:48,558 --> 00:58:51,294

815
01:05:35,698 --> 01:05:37,464

one of them down

It's not about
giving up, Janson.

We'll start off simple.
Where's Minho?

You guys don't
seriously think...

833
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:07,120
Don't look at him.

834
01:07:07,122 --> 01:07:08,921
Why are you looking at him?

835
01:07:08,923 --> 01:07:10,423
Look at me.

836
01:07:10,425 --> 01:07:12,527
He's not gonna help you.

837
01:07:15,198 --> 01:07:17,367
Now, we know you have Minho
in the building.

838
01:07:18,533 --> 01:07:19,535
Where?

839
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:23,169
He's with the others
in holding.

840
01:07:23,171 --> 01:07:24,773

841
01:07:25,642 --> 01:07:27,343

842
01:07:28,744 --> 01:07:30,012
28.

843
01:07:32,113 --> 01:07:33,879
I can make that work.

No, you guys don't understand.

845
01:07:35,985 --> 01:07:38,718
The whole level's restricted.

That's why you're
gonna come with us.

848
01:07:43,459 --> 01:07:44,994
Well, I don't know.

849
01:07:46,093 --> 01:07:48,331
We don't necessarily need her.

850
01:07:48,997 --> 01:07:49,999
Right?

851
01:07:51,767 --> 01:07:53,867
Not all of her.

852
01:07:53,869 --> 01:07:56,135

are you squeamish?

a lot worse to Minho.

talk you out of this?

01:08:59,167 --> 01:09:00,670
It's your last chance.

874
01:09:02,737 --> 01:09:06,406
You know, it's not like you
to shy away from a fight.

875
01:09:06,408 --> 01:09:09,008
And it's not like you
to go looking for one.

876
01:09:09,010 --> 01:09:11,311
I just can't help but think
if I walk out that door...

877
01:09:11,313 --> 01:09:12,982
I'm never gonna see you again.

our necks out for strangers?

- No.

01:09:35,638 --> 01:09:36,706
Never.

883
01:09:44,447 --> 01:09:46,846
She's looking good.

884
01:09:46,848 --> 01:09:47,949
Healthy.

885
01:09:49,817 --> 01:09:52,053
How've you been
getting her serum?

886
01:09:53,688 --> 01:09:55,490
What are you talking about?

887
01:09:56,724 --> 01:09:57,794
Brenda.

888
01:09:59,827 --> 01:10:01,997
I didn't think
she'd still be alive.

889
01:10:04,733 --> 01:10:06,501

890
01:10:07,402 --> 01:10:08,938

The last time we saw you.

892
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:17,680
But that was months ago.

893
01:10:22,417 --> 01:10:24,719
Thomas, that's not possible.

894
01:10:26,254 --> 01:10:28,654
She should have turned by now.

895
01:10:28,656 --> 01:10:30,390
There's no way she
could possibly still...

896
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:31,994
All right, that's enough.

897
01:10:33,696 --> 01:10:34,897
You don't believe me?

898
01:10:35,697 --> 01:10:37,834
Do you really
expect me to?

899

a long way together.</i>

1624
02:12:03,406 --> 02:12:06,740
So many have sacrificed
so much

1625
02:12:06,742 --> 02:12:08,611
to make this place possible.

1626
02:12:09,978 --> 02:12:11,481
Your friends

1627
02:12:12,982 --> 02:12:14,183
and your family.

02:12:16,486 --> 02:12:20,087
So here's to the ones
who couldn't be here.

1629
02:12:20,089 --> 02:12:21,825
Here's to the friends we lost.

1630
02:12:24,626 --> 02:12:27,763
This place is for you.
It's for all of us.

1631
02:12:28,932 --> 02:12:30,500
But this,

1632
02:12:31,334 --> 02:12:33,269
this is for them.

1633
02:12:34,470 --> 02:12:37,874
So, in your own time,
in your own way,

1634
02:12:39,442 --> 02:12:41,344
come make your peace.

1635
02:12:43,478 --> 02:12:45,779

Yeah.

1642
02:13:30,492 --> 02:13:33,229
You had this on you
while you were passed out.

1643
02:13:38,033 --> 02:13:40,437
Figured I'd keep it
safe for ya.

1644
02:13:44,107 --> 02:13:46,009
Thanks, Minho.

1645
02:13:48,010 --> 02:13:49,877
See you out there.

NEWT: <i>Dear Thomas...</i>

1648
02:14:48,103 --> 02:14:51,838
<i>This is the first letter
I can remember writing.</i>

1649
02:14:51,840 --> 02:14:55,609
<i>Obviously, I don't know if I
wrote any before the maze.</i>

1650
02:14:55,611 --> 02:15:00,912
<i>But even if it's not my first,
it's likely to be my last.</i>

1651
02:15:00,914 --> 02:15:03,685
<i>I want you to know
that I'm not scared.</i>

1652
02:15:04,619 --> 02:15:06,418
<i>Well, not of dying, anyway.</i>

1653
02:15:06,420 --> 02:15:09,354
<i>It's more forgetting.</i>

1654
02:15:09,356 --> 02:15:11,256
<i>It's losing myself
to this virus.</i>

1655
02:15:11,258 --> 02:15:13,328
<i>That's what scares me.</i>

1656
02:15:16,865 --> 02:15:19,832
<i>So every night I've been
saying their names out loud.</i>

1657
02:15:19,834 --> 02:15:21,134
<i>Alby...</i>

1658
02:15:21,136 --> 02:15:23,105
<i>Winston, Chuck.</i>

1659
02:15:24,638 --> 02:15:26,773
<i>And I just repeat them
over and over,</i>

1660
02:15:26,775 --> 02:15:29,141
<i>like a prayer,</i>

1661
02:15:29,143 --> 02:15:31,079
<i>and it all comes
flooding back.</i>

1662
02:15:34,449 --> 02:15:35,715
<i>Just the little things,
like the way</i>

1663
02:15:35,717 --> 02:15:36,882
<i>the sun used to
hit the Glade</i>

1664
02:15:36,884 --> 02:15:39,085
<i>at that perfect moment
right before</i>

1665
02:15:39,087 --> 02:15:41,487
<i>it slipped beneath the walls.</i>

1666
02:15:41,489 --> 02:15:45,125
<i>And I remember the taste
of Frypan's stew.</i>

1667
02:15:45,127 --> 02:15:47,495
<i>I never thought
I'd miss that stuff so much.</i>

1668
02:15:50,565 --> 02:15:52,698
<i>And I remember you.</i>

1669
02:15:52,700 --> 02:15:55,067
<i>I remember the first time you
came up in the Box.</i>

1670
02:15:55,069 --> 02:15:56,469
<i>Just a scared little Greenie</i>

1671
02:15:56,471 --> 02:15:58,607
<i>who couldn't even remember
his own name.</i>

1672
02:15:59,706 --> 02:16:01,474
<i>But from that moment
you ran into the maze,</i>

1673
02:16:01,476 --> 02:16:03,911
<i>I knew I would
follow you anywhere.</i>

1674
02:16:05,481 --> 02:16:07,049
<i>And I have.</i>

1675
02:16:08,984 --> 02:16:10,852
<i>We all have.</i>

1676
02:16:14,356 --> 02:16:16,555
<i>If I could do it
all over again, I would</i>

1677
02:16:16,557 --> 02:16:21,528
<i>and I wouldn't
change a thing.</i>

1678
02:16:21,530 --> 02:16:24,764
<i>And my hope for you</i>

1679
02:16:24,766 --> 02:16:26,733
<i>is that when you're looking
back years from now,</i>

1680
02:16:26,735 --> 02:16:29,036
<i>you'll be able
to say the same.</i>

1681
02:16:31,873 --> 02:16:35,540
<i>The future's
in your hands now, Tommy.</i>

1682
02:16:35,542 --> 02:16:38,079
<i>And I know you'll find a way
to do what's right.</i>

1683
02:16:39,514 --> 02:16:41,083
<i>You always have.</i>

1684
02:16:43,118 --> 02:16:44,952
<i>Take care of everyone for me.</i>

1685
02:16:46,553 --> 02:16:48,523
<i>And take care of yourself.</i>

1686
02:16:50,391 --> 02:16:52,660
<i>You deserve to be happy.</i>

1687
02:16:56,063 --> 02:16:58,032
<i>Thank you for being my friend.</i>

1688
02:17:01,003 --> 02:17:03,068
