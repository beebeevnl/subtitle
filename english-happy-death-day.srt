I wasn't sure if you wanted
to sleep in or not, so.

On the dresser.

11
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:56,990
I folded your pants last night.

12
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,160
And I wasn't sure
if that material

13

Uh, pretty wasted last night.

18
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:11,000
- Got Tylenol?
- What?

19
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:15,090
My head is killing me.
Do you have any Tylenol?

Yes...

Hi.

00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,110
You haven't
returned any of my texts.

44
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,360
Yeah.
Sorry, I've been busy.

45
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,780
Yeah. I can see that.

46
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,950
Okay, Tim, we went on <i>a</i> date.

47
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,620
One.

48
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,540
I don't have to text you back.
We're not like a thing.

49
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,290
Okay. I just...

50
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,290
You know, I figured
we had a nice time.

51
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,830
<i>You</i> had a nice time.

52
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,380
I was miserable.

53
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,130
I mean, who takes
their first date to Subway?

54
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,760
It's not like you
have a footlong.

<i>Does this look infected to you?</i>

56
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,280
<i>Someone drank my booze.</i>

57
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,330
<i>It's open!</i>

58
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,120
Oh, my God.

59
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,090
You sneaky little biotch.

60
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,340
Who was it?

61
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,630
Nobody.

62
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,010
Sisters don't keep secrets.

63
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,050
Seriously, it was nobody.

64
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,100
Well, I hope <i>nobody</i>
used a condom.

65
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,510
We don't want <i>somebody</i>
looking like a whore.

66
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,980
Thanks, Danielle.
Super helpful.

67
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,180
What are sisters for?

68
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:17,270
Oh, and don't forget.
House meeting at lunch.

69
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,610
Living for it.

70
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,200
She finally rolls in.

71
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,700
Did I totally embarrass
myself last night?

72
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,290
Not at all.

73
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,160
Unless you consider

74
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,640
dancing on a table,
starting two fights,

75
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,210
and barfing pretzel chunks
all over the bar embarrassing.

76
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,750
Please, tell me you're kidding.

77
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,840
Oh, and you also rammed your
tongue down Nick Sims' throat

78
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,380
right in front of Danielle.

79
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,370
Oh, God, but she was so
nice to me this morning.

80
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,220
Yeah, I think she was
as drunk as you last night.

81
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,020
So, consider it collective amnesia.

82
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,520
Thank God for that.

83
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,280
Oh, crap.

84
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,730
I'm so late for class.

85
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,900
Can't find my damn book!

86
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,320
Ha!

87
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,320
Hm hm.

88
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,330
Did you really think you could
keep it a secret from me?

89
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:15,670
How did you find out?

90
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,960
Driver's license.

91
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,540
Not the best picture,
I might add.

92
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,420
I assume you
changed my ringer too.

93
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:21,540
Who me?

94
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,710
Never.

95
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,590
What'd you wish for?

96
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,840
A new roommate.

97
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,260
Wench.

98
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,270
I made that from scratch!

99
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,980
Sorry, too many carbs.

100
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,390
Toodles.

101
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,730
Locomotive response
in the subject shows

102
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,320
an acceleration
across quantum plane.

103
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,750
This creates greater
orbital overlap

104
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,660
between the partially
positive beta carbon

105
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:56,370
and the partially negative
hydrogen alkali group.

106
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,500
Thanks.

107
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,790
Get your school spirit on
before the big game.

108
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,630
10% off with your student ID.

109
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,840
Okay?

110
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,610
And we still need to pick
this year's charity.

111
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,800
I can say right now,

112
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,190
There's no way we're doing

113
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,510
the special needs
art fair again.

114
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,800
Totally freaked my shit out.

115
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,140
Thoughts?

116
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,640
What's wrong?

117
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,100
Oh, I don't know...

118
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,650
What's wrong, Tree?

119
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,270
Nothing.

120
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,530
Except for that cat lady buffet
you just dumped at our table.

121
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,150
And is that chocolate milk I see?

122
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,660
I missed breakfast.

123
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,450
What <i>is</i> breakfast, Becky?

124
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,370
- Asshole!
- I'm sorry.

Wait, you two know each other?

127
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,590
- Yeah.
- No!

128
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:51,470
We had uh,
a class together last year.

129
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,970
Look, I was
bringing you this back.

130
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,730
Sorry, I didn't know where you live.

131
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,940
You know, I...

132
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:09,070
Yeah. I'm sorry again about the-
the mess.

133
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,780

Hi.

142
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,890
Um...

143
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,100
So, I thought
you only worked nights.

144
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,310
Doing a double for Jan.
She has the flu.

145

That's nice of you.

It's none of my business, but...

150
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,790
I think something like this is

151
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,910
bound to have some
pretty serious consequences.

156
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,630
There's too much
going on in the building.

157

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,450
<i>Nathan's been acting really
strange since our big fight.</i>

170
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,490
<i>And this morning, he drove to
Atlanta for a last-minute</i>

171
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,290
<i>business meeting
about opening a new gym.</i>

172
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,580
Enter.

173
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,460
<i>It's weird because I've never heard
anything about it before.</i>

174
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,630
<i>But I'm trying not to
let that bring me down.</i>

175
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,630
- Is that my top?
- How cute is it on me?

176
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,590
Whatever. Just don't get
anything on it, please.

177
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,680
You mean like Nick's
nutter butter?

178
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,650
Wow. Classy, Danielle.

179
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,170
What time are you
going to the party tonight?

180
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,600
I dunno, later.

181
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,980
Ugh.
Our tuition dollars at work.

182
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,190
Anyhoo...

183
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,070
Don't be too late, or all the cute
Sigma boys will be taken.

184
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,250
- 'kay. Byeee.
- Byeee.

185
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,990
<i>Who took my hair dryer?</i>

186
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,360
Crazy bitch.

187
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,120
<i>Teresa, it's Dad.</i>

188
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,990
<i>I sat in that restaurant waiting
for you for over an hour.</i>

189
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,120
<i>I can't believe you would
do this to me.</i>

190
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,330
<i>Today, of all days!</i>

191
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,170
Bayfield, baby!

192
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,260
Can't miss tonight!

193
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,760
Okay, you guys are hilarious!

194
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:08,100
You can come out now!

195
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,190
Losers.

196
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,550
Yo, I think your friends
went the other way.

197
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,300
Can I help you?

198
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:52,690
Look, weirdo, I'm not scared.

199
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,610
Why don't you go try this with

200
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,520
one of the heffers
at Delta Gamma?

201
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,940
They're into cosplay.

202
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,330
Okay, I'm calling the cops!

203
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:03,590
<i>Shut up!</i>

204
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,890
Oh, hey, you're up.

205
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:12,470
I wasn't sure if you wanted
to sleep in or not, so.

206
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:21,020
Oh... right.

207
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,610
I folded your pants
for you last night

208
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,240
I wasn't sure if the
material gets wrinkled.

209
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:29,660
Uh...

210
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,170
I don't know if you
remember my name or not.

211
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,540
You were
pretty wasted last night.

212
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,750
But uh...

213
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,750
- I'm...
- Carter.

214
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,710
You remembered.

215
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,170
Ugh. Tylenol?

216
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,260
What?

217
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,550
Uh, my head is killing me.
Do you have any Tylenol?

218
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,510
Oh, uh, yes.

219
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,260
Um...

220
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,220
It's over there.

221
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,850
Right.

222
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:00,020
It's underneath your clothes...

223
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:03,570
- on the...
- Right, right.

224
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,490
Thanks.

225
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,160
And...

226
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:14,280
It's like you've
been here before.

227
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,290
Are you okay?

228
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,750
Tree?

229
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,630
Are you okay?

230
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,220
Dude, did you hit that
fine vagine or what?

231
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,260
Oh.

232
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,390
I'm...

233
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:41,020
I'm sorry.

234
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,030
Nice one, dickhead.

235
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:03,080
Hey. Stop global warming? I...

236
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,040
Sorry, no, thanks.

237
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,090
- Oh.
- Oh.

238
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,430

I can't hear you!

Hey.

251
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,510
You haven't returned
any of my texts.

252
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,470
Tim, what day is it?

253
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,590
Uh, Monday, the 18th.

254
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,370
You're sure?

255
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,680
I'm pretty sure.

256
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:01,890
I um...

257
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,020
I gotta go.

258
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,070
Call me?

259
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:30,300
Oh, my God.

260
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,590
You sneaky little biotch.

261
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,130
Who was it?

262
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,600
Sisters don't keep secrets.

263
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,350
I'm totally having
déjà vu right now.

264
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,600
Oh, I have it all the time.

265
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:46,820
It's supposed to mean like

266
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,830
someone's thinking about you
while they're masturbating.

267
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,360
I have it at least
five times a day.

268
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,280
Seriously, I've been having it
all day. It's so weird.

269
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,820
Maybe you should switch to
water next time, hun.

270
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,910
I... yeah, thanks.
I'll keep that in mind.

271
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,460
What are sisters for?

272
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:05,080
Oh, uh, and don't forget.
House meeting at lunch.

273
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,580
Hello?

274
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,960
It's been on the board
since last Thursday, Tree.

275
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:13,420
Yeah... I remember. I...

276
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,930
She finally rolls in.

277
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,810
That's so weird.

278
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,020
You okay?

279
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,060
You were kind of a mess
last night.

280
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:30,360
Oh, shhit.
I'm so late for class.

281
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,490
Hm hm.

282
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:39,200
Did you really think you'd
keep it a secret from me?

283
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,440
Don't you wanna know
how I found out?

284
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:45,620
Driver's license?

285
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:46,830
Clever girl.

286
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,670
That picture, though.

287
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:50,210
I gotta go.

288
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,000
But, you didn't even
blow out the c...

289
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,510
Candle.

290
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,550
<i>We really need to
step up our game.</i>

291
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,680
And we still need to pick
this year's charity.

292
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,930
I can say right now,

293
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,400
There's no way we're doing

294
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,890
the special needs
art fair again.

295
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:12,060
<i>Get your school spirit on
before the big game.</i>

296
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:14,480
<i>10% off with your student ID.</i>

297
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,530
What's wrong, Tree?

298
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,620
Um... I'm just
a little tired, I guess.

299
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,000
No, dumbass.

300
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,000
What's wrong with <i>that</i>?

301
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,800
So not Kappa cuisine.

302
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,880
And is that
chocolate milk I see?

303
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,590
I missed breakfast.

304
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,260
We all missed breakfast, Becky.

305
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,850
Becky, look out!

306
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,920
I'm so sorry.

307
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,370
I'm sorry, Tree.

308
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,310
Wait, you two know each other?

309
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,340
- Yeah.
- No!

310
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,240
I mean, we had a class
together last year.

311
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,450
That's all.

312
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,870
I'm sorry about all this.

313
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,030
Hey!

314
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:10,880
What?

315
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,080
My bracelet.

316
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,330
Oh.

317
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:19,090
You know, I'm sorry again
about the mess.

318
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,840
What a douchebag.

319
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,320
I can't do this today.

320
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,540
There's too much
going on in the building.

321
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,600
I need to talk to you.

322
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,570
Tree, I...

323
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,740
I know what you're gonna say.

324
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:40,940
You do?

325
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,450
Look...

326
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,960
It's normal for a young girl

327
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:47,990
to have feelings
for an older man.

328
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,870
But you can't fall in love.

329
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,460
I'm not
falling in love with you.

330
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:54,580
You're not?

331
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,540
No. I've been having
the weirdest day...

332
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:02,170

Gregory, are you in there?

335

Thank God you locked the door.

336
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,650
Hey, sweetie.

337
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,820
Ah, I didn't realize
I'd locked the door, um...

338
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,710
Uh, just wrapping up here.

339
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,030
Have you met my student, Teresa?

340
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,320
No.

341
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,120
I haven't.

342

Lori.
She said she'd be here.

She's so out of the house
next year.

406
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,250
thought I'd show
a little school spirit.

407
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,000

I'd get clocked for it.

496
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:28,360
But someone is.
I just don't know who it is yet.

497
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,120
Tree, you're starting
to freak me out!

498
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:31,740
Well, how do you think <i>I</i> feel?

499
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,620
Tree, look at me.

500
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:37,200
Nobody is trying to kill you.

501
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,750
Yes, they are, Lori.

502
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,090
Tree!
Look at me.

503
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,420
I know that today is hard,
with your mom and all.

504
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,930
Why don't you skip class?

505
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,260
Just take the day off
and get some rest.

506
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:52,380
I promise you, you'll
feel better tomorrow.

507
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,390
Okay?

508
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,900
Let's see you
get in here now, asshole.

509
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,120
Tree, why is the door locked?

510
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:28,220
Um... I just need some
alone time.

511
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:30,170
What time are you
going to the party tonight?

512
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,220
I don't know.

513
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:38,680
Our tuition dollars at work.

514
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,990
Anyhoo...

515
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:43,890
Don't be too late, or all the cute
Sigma boys will be taken.

516
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,480
Okay, see you soon.

517
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,770
<i>Who took my hair dryer?</i>

518
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,280
<i>...opening a new gym.</i>

519
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,410
<i>Which is weird because I've never
heard anything about it before.</i>

520
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,910
<i>But I'm trying not to
let that bring me down.</i>

521
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:03,580
<i>Because I'm on my way
to pick up Jace.</i>

522
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:08,260
<i>I'm just happy
I get to see Jace, so.</i>

523
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:10,680
<i>I know, it's been like
almost a month.</i>

524
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:13,090
<i>I'm just so excited to see you.</i>

525
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,090
Where'd Lori put
the freaking remote?

526
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:21,310
<i>Hi, Jace!
Hey, Jace!</i>

527
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,480
He-ey!

528
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,150
- Hi.
- Hi.

529
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,820

00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,250

00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,790

536
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,520

00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,290

540

541

<i>Tombs was the subject of...</i>

542
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:58,590
<i>- Aah!
- ...boring hairstyle?</i>

543
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:00,560
<i>Do you go through
a can of hairspray</i>

544
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:02,740
<i>trying to get that
full-volumized look?</i>

547
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:09,780

00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:43,430

00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:50,180

this is even remotely possible...

There has to be a reason
you're stuck in this day.

Out of all the days in your life,

what makes this day special?

582

What gives this day meaning?

- Nothing.
<i>- ♪ Yeah, it's my birthday ♪</i>

<i>♪ And now you gotta

00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,800
Its' your birthday?

586
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,130
- Yeah.
- Hello?

587
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:25,600
So? Birthdays are just
excuses to like

588
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,840
eat cake and open presents.
There's no real meaning...

589
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:29,430
No, it's symbolic.

590
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,890
Okay? Whoever's killing you
knows it's your birthday.

591
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,640
Ew.

592
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:36,440
All right, look.

593
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:38,740
Give me a list of names

594
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:40,440
of everybody who knows
it's your birthday

595
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,610
and whoever's trying to kill you.

596
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,830
Well, thanks to my sorority,

597
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:47,460
pretty much the entire school
knows it's my birthday.

598
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:50,200
God, they're throwing me this
stupid surprise party tonight.

599
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:52,580
I mean, it literally
could be anyone.

600
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,330
I mean, who has motive?

601
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:59,920
Okay, maybe it's Danielle.

602
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,180
All right.

603
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:03,010
Apparently, I made out
with some guy she liked

604
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:04,670
right in front of her
last night.

605
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:07,180
Oh.

606
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:10,850
Must've been before we met.

607
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,930
Busy night.

608
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:14,600
Okay, Mister I'm-gonna-

609
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,230
take-this-drunk-girl-home-
and-take-advantage-of-her.

610
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,700
Don't judge.

611
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:20,670
For the record, I didn't take
advantage of you last night.

612
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,570
Okay? I slept on Ryan's bed.

613
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:26,470
So, we didn't?

614
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,290
- Have s...
- No!

615
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,710
You were wasted last night.

616
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:31,540
You know, I was afraid
you were gonna fall or

617
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:33,370
choke on your own vomit
like Janis Joplin.

618
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:44,390
Uh, what were we...?

619
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,760
- Suspects.
- Right, suspects.

620
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,510
Um, okay so, Danielle.

621
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:53,390
Pfff... Gregory?
Um... his wife.

622
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,360
Creepy Tim.

623
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:57,980
Ooh, that tiny girl from T.J. Maxx
that I got fired.

624
00:40:58,010 --> 00:41:01,610
And maybe the Uber driver
that I spit on last week.

625
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,820
I think his name was...
what?

626
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:05,320
Nobody's perfect.

627
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:08,570
Okay, this isn't helping.

628
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,160
This is pointless, isn't it?

629
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:15,450
All right, look,
the way I see it, is, is...

630
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,580
You have unlimited
amount of lives.

631
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:20,330
So, you have unlimited opportunities
to solve your own murder.

632
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,510
So, I'm just supposed to keep

633
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:25,800
dying unitl I figure out
who my killer is?

634
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:27,670
That's your genius plan?

635
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,550

I wasn't sure if you
wanted to sleep in or...

693
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:50,960
Your plan totally sucks.

694
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:52,250
What?

695
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,030
I don't know if you remember
my name or not.

696
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,620
You know, you were
pretty wasted last night.

00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:06,290
Um, but I'm Carter.

698
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:07,950
Are you okay?

699
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:10,330
Never better.

700
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,760
Are you sure you're okay?

701
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:18,960
I'm fine.

702
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:21,430
Dude, did you hit that
fine vagine, or what?

703
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:23,050
Sup, hey...

704
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:25,510
Um, I'm sorry to bother
you guys, uh...

705
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,720
How's it go?

706
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:30,730
I had to sleep in my car, so...

707
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:36,070
Carter, please, a little help.

708
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:37,270
Carter!

709
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:15,690
Tree.

710
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:18,900
Hey, hey, hey, calm down.
I-It's just me.

711
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:23,320
How you doing?

712
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,870
Wh-what happened?

713
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:29,540
You collapsed this morning.

714
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:30,750
What day is it?

715
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:32,230
It's Monday.

716
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:33,620
What's the date?

717
00:46:33,910 --> 00:46:35,540
Uh, it's the 18th.

718
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:40,050
Oh, we've been trying to get
in contact with your parents.

719
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:42,470
But for some reason...

720
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:47,260
- Jeez!
- Can I help you?

721
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:49,330
Uh, I'm just checkin' on her.

722
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,270
It's okay. He's a friend.

723
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:53,520
Sorry, visiting hours are over.

724
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:54,890
Got it.

725
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:57,610
Thanks, Carter.

726
00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:00,610
Feel better.

727
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:05,650
When can I get out of here?

728
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:13,910
I'm having a hard time
pulling your medical records.

729
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,500
Why?

730
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,800
We just got these
back from imaging.

731
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:24,800
These are signs of major trauma.

732
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:29,800
Given the severity of the scar tissue
and the size of the lesions,

733
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,520
This is gonna sound crazy, but...

734
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:38,350
technically, you should be dead.

735
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:45,070
Hey, hey, hey,
what are you doing?

736
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,540
I need to get out of here.

737
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:48,380
No way, no. You need to
stay here for observation.

738
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:50,370
If I don't get out of here,
I'm gonna die.

739
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,010
Tree, shh, listen to me.

740
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:56,960
You are absolutely safe here.

741
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,130
Okay.

742
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,050
I won't let anything
happen to you.

743
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,100
I'm really thirsty.

744
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,310
Could you get me a soda?

745
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:16,730
Sure.

746
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:19,310
Thank you.

747
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,710
Special delivery.

748
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,910
Keys, keys, keys...

749
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:26,710
Greg, where are
the car keys, come on!

750
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:30,490
Tree, Tree, it's okay.

751
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,400
It's okay, it's just me.

752
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:33,990
Gregory, look out!

753
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:03,520
Come on, come on, come on!

754
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:59,220
I did it.

755
00:52:59,430 --> 00:53:01,090
I did it!

756
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:03,100
I did it!

757
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:05,600

758
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:07,310
Yeah!

759
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,690

760
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:13,690
Whoo!

761
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:18,360
What?

762
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,950
Oh, no, no, no!

763
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:22,660
Come on!

764
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:24,160
No!

765
00:53:24,370 --> 00:53:25,790
Oh, shit!

766
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:42,970
Shit, shit, shit.

767
00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:48,100
I know I was
speeding, officer, I just...

768
00:53:48,310 --> 00:53:49,600
Turn off the engine, please.

769
00:53:50,890 --> 00:53:52,400
Yes, officer.

770
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:54,650
License and registration.

771
00:53:56,070 --> 00:53:57,570
I um...

772
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,150
I don't have it.

773
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:05,830
- Pardon me?
- He's trying to kill me again.

774
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:07,620
- Again?
- Yes.

775
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:09,090
I mean, no, I...

776
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,230
He was trying before,
but this time I got away.

777
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:13,030
But I-I didn't have time
to grab my clothes

778
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:14,830
and my driver's license
is in my pocket.

779
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:19,920
Ma'am, are you under
the influence of alcohol

780
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:21,800
or any other controlled substance?

781
00:54:21,830 --> 00:54:23,680
No! That is
what I am trying to...

782
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,100
Wait.

783
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:31,150
If I am, does that mean

784
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:32,840
that you're going to arrest me

785
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:34,800
and lock me in a jail cell?

786
00:54:34,830 --> 00:54:36,770
That's how it usually works.

787
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,270
I'm drunk.

788
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:41,540
- You are?
- Wasted.

789
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:44,240
And I'm high.
You know, pills, weed.

790
00:54:44,270 --> 00:54:45,870
You name it, man, I'm on it.

791
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:49,540
Um, well...

792
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:53,210
Then I'm gonna put you
under arrest.

793
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,630
That's a good idea.

794
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:59,000
Let me help you.

795
00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:01,550
Uh, all right.

796
00:55:05,550 --> 00:55:07,720

00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:40,830
Water, por favor, mhm.

820
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:54,900
Dude, did you hit that...

821
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:57,060
Hi, I'm the so-called
"fine vagine".

822
00:57:57,090 --> 00:57:58,830
If that's the way
you refer to girls,

823
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:00,600
you and your hand
are going to have

824
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:02,100
a very lasting relationship.

825
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:04,270
Have a nice day.

826
00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:08,900
What?

827
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:12,360
I mean, are you-you always
this charming in the morning?

828
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:13,910
Just this one.

829
00:58:18,490 --> 00:58:21,080
So, you having a bad dream
or something?

830
00:58:21,110 --> 00:58:22,460
Sorry?

831
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:24,960
You were just screamin'
before you woke up.

832
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:28,550
Well... I was dying.

833
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:29,920
Again.

834
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:31,510
What?

835
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,590
Uh, it's a long story.

836
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:37,580
Well, I mean,
I got, you know, time.

837
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:40,180
I'm not doing
anything today if you wanna.

838
00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:41,810
Seriously.

839
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:44,060
I hate this sticker.

840
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:51,650
Hey, wait!

841
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:53,530
Why are you following me?

842
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:55,070
I wanna hear your story.

843
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,710
Look, no offense,
but the last time

844
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:59,830
I explained it to you,
it got me nowhere. So.

845
00:59:00,450 --> 00:59:02,250
The last time?

846
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:03,660
Hey.

847
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:06,630
So you-you're having bad dreams.

848
00:59:06,830 --> 00:59:09,670
I took an elective course on
neurocognition and dream content.

849
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:11,060
Hooray for you.

850
00:59:11,090 --> 00:59:12,670
I'm just saying, I...

851
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,680
I might be able to help,
you know.

852
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:16,280
Can you help me stop
reliving the same day

853
00:59:16,290 --> 00:59:18,010
over and over
only to be murdered

854
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:19,760
by someone I may
or may not know?

855
00:59:19,970 --> 00:59:22,140
Yup. Thought so.

856
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:23,640
Stop global warming?

857
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:29,610
So, wait, you literally think
you're reliving the same day?

858
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:30,870
Yup.

859
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,110
And somebody kills you?

860
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:33,320
Yup again.

861
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:37,990
All right, come on, you're
just messin' with me, right?

862
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:40,620
Sprinklers.

863
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:43,910
Car alarm.

864
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,290
Now, see that pledge over there,

865
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:51,480
the one in the baseball hat?

866
00:59:51,510 --> 00:59:53,670
He's going to fall right now.

867
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,170
Keep going!

868
00:59:55,590 --> 00:59:57,260
Any questions?

869
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:03,470
- How are your fries?
- Yeah, they're good.

870
01:00:07,650 --> 01:00:09,730
That's impressive.

871
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:11,480
That was nothing.

872
01:00:20,490 --> 01:00:22,200
Did you get it all out?

873
01:00:22,370 --> 01:00:24,290
Whatever.
You won't remember it, anyway.

874
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:26,250
<i>♪ Yeah, it's my birthday ♪</i>

875

pick up the phone ♪</i>

876
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:30,140

878

It's your dad. You wanna-
wanna get that?

879
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,430
I was never close to my dad.

880
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:47,310
Can't even remember
the last time

881
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:48,520
he called me on my birthday.

882
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:50,810
He kinda always forgets.

883
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:53,110
Yeah. I'm supposed
to be with mine.

884
01:00:53,690 --> 01:00:56,110
I don't know, I couldn't bear
the thought of sitting through

885
01:00:56,140 --> 01:00:58,080
another uncomfortable celebration

886
01:00:58,110 --> 01:01:00,490
while we both pretend
that everything is awesome.

887
01:01:00,910 --> 01:01:02,870
Are you closer with your mom?

888
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:04,330
Was.

889
01:01:04,370 --> 01:01:05,620
What happened?

890
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:08,830
Oh, she...

891
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:10,090
Yeah.

892
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:11,420
Three years ago.

893
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:14,130
I'm sorry.

894
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:16,630
That-that sucks.

895
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:18,050
Yeah.

896
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:20,970
We actually share
the same birthday, though.

897
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:23,180
Seriously? That's crazy.

898
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:27,980
You know, when I was a kid,

899
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:30,640
I always got to skip school.

900
01:01:30,850 --> 01:01:32,980
We'd go to the beach.

901
01:01:34,270 --> 01:01:38,860
My dad would buy us this like
huge birthday cake.

902
01:01:39,490 --> 01:01:41,490
And put just one candle on it.

903
01:01:41,910 --> 01:01:43,490
We'd blow it out together.

904
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,240
I bet you miss her.

905
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:49,370
Yeah.

906
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:52,180
You know, it's funny,

907
01:01:52,210 --> 01:01:54,960
you relive the same day
over and over again

908
01:01:56,750 --> 01:01:59,470
you kind of start to see
who you really are.

909
01:02:02,550 --> 01:02:04,180
If my mom saw me now,

910
01:02:04,390 --> 01:02:06,310
and who I've become,

911
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:10,770
I don't think
she'd be very proud.

912
01:02:10,890 --> 01:02:12,100
Don't say that.

913
01:02:12,130 --> 01:02:13,400
It's true.

914
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,320
I'm not a good person, Carter.

915
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:21,860
Maybe it's karma,
maybe I deserve it.

916
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:29,290
Well, look, I don't
know you all that well, but...

917
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:31,290
It's never too late to change.

918
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:33,240
I mean, especially if
what you're saying is true,

919
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:35,330
Each new day is

920
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:37,920
it's a chance to be
somebody better.

921
01:02:38,090 --> 01:02:39,670
See, that's just it.

922
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:44,640
I don't think I have
that many chances left.

923
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:50,270
I keep on getting weaker
every time I come back.

924
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:55,020
You know, maybe I'm like that
cat with nine lives.

925
01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:58,610
Eventually, I'm gonna run out.

926
01:02:59,610 --> 01:03:02,820
<i>Let's go live now to
Bayfield University Hospital.</i>

927

<i>Where Jennifer Trite has the latest

928
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:08,700
<i>I'm standing outside the

929
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:10,840

934
01:03:21,050 --> 01:03:22,550

01:03:30,930 --> 01:03:32,390

- He's been here the whole time.

941
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:39,650
What? Tree!

942
01:03:40,730 --> 01:03:43,320
Hey...
Tree!

943
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:47,700
He's going to escape.
Call the police.

944
01:03:47,730 --> 01:03:48,540
Who?

945
01:03:48,570 --> 01:03:50,120
John Tombs.
Just call the police.

946
01:03:50,150 --> 01:03:51,380
What?

947
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:52,500
Wait, don't go in there!

948
01:03:52,530 --> 01:03:53,670
Shit.

949
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:55,160
Excuse me, what are you doing?

950
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:53,350
He has a gun.

951
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:55,060
He has a gun, run!

952
01:05:00,770 --> 01:05:02,820

01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:31,820
You save that planet, girl.

Oh, Tim!

01:09:05,930 --> 01:09:07,310
I know you're back there.

1004
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:08,900
Hey, Tim.

1005
01:09:08,930 --> 01:09:10,310
- Hey.
- Hi.

1006
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:12,520
Uh, you haven't returned
any of my texts.

1007
01:09:12,730 --> 01:09:14,080
Look, Tim.

1008
01:09:14,110 --> 01:09:16,400
Let's get real.
I know you don't like girls.

1009
01:09:16,610 --> 01:09:18,990
Stop trying to be
someone you're not.

1010
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:21,250
Love is love, right?

1011
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:23,300
Now you go out there

1012
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:26,620
and get yourself a
fine piece of man ass.

Oh, my God.

1022
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:52,560
You sneaky little biAtch.

1023
01:09:52,590 --> 01:09:53,830
His name's Carter.

1024
01:09:53,860 --> 01:09:55,730
No, we did not have sex.

1025
01:09:55,940 --> 01:09:58,030
But, if I finally make it
through this day somehow,

1026
01:09:58,060 --> 01:09:59,530
I'm gonna have his babies.

1027
01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:01,240
Lots to do. Gotta go.

1028
01:10:04,030 --> 01:10:05,530
She finally rolls in.

1029
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:14,590
What's wrong?

1030
01:10:14,790 --> 01:10:17,920
- Ugh.
- Oh, nothing. I was...

1031
01:10:17,950 --> 01:10:19,800
Look, Lori.

1032
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:23,390
I have been <i>the</i> worst roommate.

1033
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:26,690
You've always been there for me

1034
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:29,180
but I've been way too selfish
to even appreciate it.

1035
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:31,850
Can we start over?

1036
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:34,560
I promise not to be
such a loser.

1037
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:38,480
Are you high?

1038
01:10:38,980 --> 01:10:41,110
On life.

1039
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:46,620
Oh, by the way, phone you
about this mystery guy.

1040
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:51,300
When extreme agitation occurs,

1041
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:52,920
the locomotive response
in the subject

1042
01:10:52,950 --> 01:10:54,130
shows an accelaration...

1043
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:55,500
Dr. Butler.

1044
01:10:56,710 --> 01:10:58,210
Can I have a word, please?

1045
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:07,430
What the hell do...

1046
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:09,640
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

1047
01:11:09,810 --> 01:11:11,020
I'm ending this.

1048
01:11:13,230 --> 01:11:15,440
Wait. What?

1049
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:18,440
I never should've
started seeing you.

1050
01:11:19,030 --> 01:11:20,320
It was wrong.

1051
01:11:20,530 --> 01:11:21,610
And I...

1052
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:26,620
Anyway, I can't change
what I've done, but

1053
01:11:26,820 --> 01:11:28,660
I can start trying to be
a better person today.

1054
01:11:31,250 --> 01:11:34,540
What lame little self-help book
did you get that from?

1055
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:39,630
You know what, you have a wife
who loves you so much.

1056
01:11:40,710 --> 01:11:42,660
So, if you can't be faithful to her,

1057
01:11:42,690 --> 01:11:44,630
at least have the balls to leave.

1058
01:11:47,850 --> 01:11:49,810
Don't expect me to let you
coast by my class now.

1059
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:52,020
Already dropped it.

1060
01:11:57,810 --> 01:11:59,440
I just have to say

1061
01:11:59,610 --> 01:12:03,440
how totally sad
and disappointing it is

1062
01:12:03,610 --> 01:12:05,600
when certain people
can't be bothered

1063
01:12:05,630 --> 01:12:07,620
to make it to a
mandatory House meeting.

1064
01:12:07,820 --> 01:12:10,620
We were supposed to be
picking this year's charity.

1065
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:13,830
Becky...

1066
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:16,040
Is that chocolate milk I see?

1067
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:18,540
I skipped breakfast.

1068
01:12:18,570 --> 01:12:20,130
Oh!

1069
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:24,340
Mmm, mmm.

1070
01:12:24,510 --> 01:12:26,310
Mmm, guys, it's so good.

1071
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:28,140
What's up with the fat fest?

1072
01:12:28,170 --> 01:12:29,350
We're Kappas.

1073
01:12:29,510 --> 01:12:32,520
Come on, hun, live a little.
A few calories won't kill ya.

1074
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:36,730
No. It'll just turn
me into a chunker.

1075
01:12:37,230 --> 01:12:38,440
Like Becky here.

1076
01:12:43,230 --> 01:12:44,240
Wait.

1077
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,340
Oh, my God!

1078
01:13:07,130 --> 01:13:08,340
It'll be okay.

1079
01:13:08,930 --> 01:13:10,010
Hey, Tree.

1080
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:11,720
Hey.

1081
01:13:12,220 --> 01:13:13,930
I just uh, came on by to...

1082
01:13:22,110 --> 01:13:23,520
What was that for?

1083
01:13:24,230 --> 01:13:26,940
I have to run, but what
are you doing later tonight?

1084
01:13:27,110 --> 01:13:28,290
Nothing.

1085
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:30,660
Do you wanna take me out
for my birthday?

1086
01:13:30,870 --> 01:13:32,070
What's the punchline?

1087
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:34,160
Look, I know
it's really random, but...

1088
01:13:34,370 --> 01:13:36,050
I promise I'll explain
everything tomorrow.

1089
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:37,750
Assuming there is one.

1090
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:39,460
Just say yes.

1091
01:13:40,540 --> 01:13:41,880
All right, yeah.

1092
01:13:42,250 --> 01:13:43,340
Cool.

1093
01:13:45,250 --> 01:13:46,340
Okay.

1094
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:03,440
Excuse me.

1095
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:07,200
Can I pay for my coffee, please?

1096
01:14:07,230 --> 01:14:09,950
- You're not gonna eat?
- No, just the check, please.

1097
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:11,530
I'll be right back.

1098
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:24,040
Hi, Daddy. Sorry I'm late.

1099
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:28,050
Like your tie.

1100
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:31,840
Thanks.

1101
01:14:32,130 --> 01:14:33,220
How's school?

1102
01:14:34,430 --> 01:14:35,550
Fine.

1103
01:14:36,060 --> 01:14:37,430
You like your classes?

1104
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:41,440
They're fine, Dad.
I don't wanna do that anymore.

1105
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:42,730
Do what?

1106
01:14:44,150 --> 01:14:45,520
Small talk.

1107
01:14:46,650 --> 01:14:47,820
It's just that

1108
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:50,320
this day

1109
01:14:51,490 --> 01:14:53,490
this day is really hard for me.

1110
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:56,330
And um...

1111
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:01,910
I miss Mom.

1112
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:04,460
You know, miss her so much.

1113
01:15:04,630 --> 01:15:06,460
I miss the way that she smells.

1114
01:15:07,550 --> 01:15:11,340
I miss that
crazy horse laugh she has.

1115
01:15:14,050 --> 01:15:15,640
Yeah, me too.

1116
01:15:16,260 --> 01:15:19,930
And I... I guess I thought that if.

1117
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:22,850
I avoided all of it,

1118
01:15:23,730 --> 01:15:27,650
or avoided you that somehow
it would be easier.

1119
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:28,860
But it's not.

1120
01:15:30,650 --> 01:15:33,650
It's been so much worse.

1121
01:15:36,030 --> 01:15:38,330
All of this running and hiding

1122
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:40,540
has made me so miserable.

1123
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:44,710
And I think I finally
figured it out.

1124
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:49,130
I mean, it took something
like totally crazy, but...

1125
01:15:51,210 --> 01:15:53,010
But I'm here.

1126
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:55,340
And I love you.

1127
01:15:55,510 --> 01:15:59,640
And I am so, so sorry
that I hurt you.

1128
01:16:10,820 --> 01:16:12,940
Happy birthday, baby.

1129
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:49,810
Stay calm.

1130
01:16:50,310 --> 01:16:52,440
I need you to stand up.

1131
01:16:53,030 --> 01:16:54,320
Slowly.

1132
01:16:57,320 --> 01:16:58,740
Slowly.

1133
01:16:59,410 --> 01:17:00,830
Okay, good.

1134
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:08,040
I guess this is a
really bad idea.

1135
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:09,920
Well, so is dying
for the 16th time.

1136
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:12,210
Okay.

1137
01:17:12,420 --> 01:17:14,210
Now, turn around.

1138
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:18,840
I need you to listen to me.

1139
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:20,640
He's going to escape.

1140
01:17:21,010 --> 01:17:23,310
We could talk about this,
just put the gun down.

1141
01:17:23,510 --> 01:17:25,520
He is going to escape.
Go get help.

1142
01:17:25,730 --> 01:17:26,930
- Go!
- Okay.

1143
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:13,710
I know you're not asleep.

1144
01:18:13,910 --> 01:18:15,210
Open your eyes.

1145
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:24,510
Safety's on, little girl.

1146
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:32,730
Uh-uh.

1147
01:18:32,930 --> 01:18:34,310
Look what we have here.

1148
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:35,810
Mmm?

1149
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:41,650
You know,

1150
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:45,110
It's a real nice surprise you
comin' and visit me like this.

1151
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,120
Hoo.

1152
01:18:56,330 --> 01:18:57,830
I like you.

1153
01:18:58,710 --> 01:19:00,420
Damn shame.

1154
01:19:02,420 --> 01:19:04,800
You're a feisty little shit,
ain't ya?

1155
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:11,100
That's right, crawl,
little girl, crawl.

1156
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:14,310
Don't worry.

1157
01:19:14,730 --> 01:19:17,730
I'll just make this one
real quick for ya, okay?

1158
01:19:31,330 --> 01:19:32,410
Hey!

1159
01:19:32,830 --> 01:19:35,910
Safety's off.
Thanks for the tip.

1160
01:19:50,140 --> 01:19:51,720
<i>Who took my hair dryer?</i>

1161
01:19:55,930 --> 01:19:56,950
So this has gotta be like

1162
01:19:56,980 --> 01:19:58,940
the strangest birthday
you've ever had, huh?

1163
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:00,940
You have no idea.

1164
01:20:03,150 --> 01:20:05,530
Did you ever figure out
how Tombs got free?

1165
01:20:05,820 --> 01:20:08,320
No. No one knows.

1166
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:10,360
It's kinda like Houdini.

1167
01:20:10,660 --> 01:20:12,490
Yeah, I guess.

1168
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:25,300
What are you gonna wish for?

1169
01:20:29,090 --> 01:20:30,260
Tomorrow.

1170
01:20:30,470 --> 01:20:31,590
Tomorrow?

1171
01:20:32,470 --> 01:20:34,760
What, is that kind of a given?

1172
01:20:35,970 --> 01:20:37,890
Aiming for anything higher?

1173
01:20:39,390 --> 01:20:40,480
Nah.

1174
01:20:41,190 --> 01:20:43,360
Tomorrow's good enough for me.

1175
01:21:05,790 --> 01:21:07,380
<i>Shut up!</i>

1176
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:09,880
<i>♪ Yeah, it's my birthday ♪</i>

1177
01:21:10,090 --> 01:21:12,180
<i>♪ And now you gotta
pick up the phone ♪</i>

1178
01:21:12,380 --> 01:21:13,640
Oh, hey, you're up.

1179
01:21:14,050 --> 01:21:15,140
Carter?

1180
01:21:15,350 --> 01:21:17,260
Yeah. I'm surprised
you remember my name.

1181
01:21:17,470 --> 01:21:19,140
You were pretty wasted
last night.

1182
01:21:19,270 --> 01:21:20,350
This can't be happening.

1183
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:21,870
- This can't be happening.
- What?

1184
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:23,290
I killed him!

1185
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:24,730
I stopped it!

1186
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:26,820
Who?
What are you talkin' about?

1187
01:21:28,030 --> 01:21:29,690
What's goin' on?

1188
01:21:31,490 --> 01:21:32,720
I mean, look, you were
probably just having a

1189
01:21:32,730 --> 01:21:33,790
bad dream or something.

1190
01:21:33,820 --> 01:21:35,350
Like it happens to me
all the time

1191
01:21:35,380 --> 01:21:36,910
when I'm dreaming,
you know, I...

1192
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:41,790
Nice one, dickhead.

1193
01:21:43,370 --> 01:21:44,960
She finally rolls in.

1194
01:21:48,590 --> 01:21:49,920
Going somewhere?

1195
01:21:50,130 --> 01:21:51,130
Yes.

1196
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:53,220
As far away as possible.

1197
01:21:53,430 --> 01:21:54,510
Tree, what's wrong?

1198
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:55,720
Me.

1199
01:21:55,930 --> 01:21:56,930
I was wrong.

1200
01:21:57,100 --> 01:21:59,300
I thought that if I stopped running
that I could beat it.

1201
01:21:59,310 --> 01:22:00,810
But it's never gonna stop.

1202
01:22:01,020 --> 01:22:02,390
Tree, you're freaking me out.

1203
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:04,190
Oh, well, that's me, a freak!

1204
01:22:12,990 --> 01:22:14,200
Tree.

1205
01:22:15,490 --> 01:22:16,820
Tree, look.

1206
01:22:18,410 --> 01:22:19,910
Happy birthday.

1207
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:23,500
Thanks. But I
already ate it last night.

1208
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:31,840
Oh, my God.

1209
01:22:33,630 --> 01:22:35,430
I died in my sleep.

1210
01:22:37,050 --> 01:22:38,220
What?

1211
01:22:42,140 --> 01:22:43,520
You killed me.

1212
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:46,850
What?

1213
01:22:49,150 --> 01:22:50,820
You poisoned it.

1214
01:22:52,650 --> 01:22:54,530
But I never ate it before.

1215
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:03,250
So you had to find another way.

1216
01:23:03,950 --> 01:23:06,420
Then Tombs fell
right into your lap.

1217
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:11,050
Perfect scapegoat.

1218
01:23:14,550 --> 01:23:16,510
You had access to him.

1219
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:19,720
Did you drug him first?

1220
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:28,660
You knew that if he escaped,

1221
01:23:28,690 --> 01:23:30,400
everyone would assume
that he killed me.

1222
01:23:33,190 --> 01:23:34,900
But it was always you.

1223
01:23:39,450 --> 01:23:41,990
Tree, are...
Is this a joke?

1224
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:43,990
You think I would actually
try to poison you

1225
01:23:44,020 --> 01:23:45,410
with a freaking cupcake?

1226
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,120
Okay then.

1227
01:23:49,710 --> 01:23:50,790
Prove it.

1228
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:57,010
Go on, Lori.

1229
01:23:59,220 --> 01:24:00,590
Take a bite.

1230
01:24:03,310 --> 01:24:04,560
Go on, Lori.

1231
01:24:06,060 --> 01:24:07,980
You really are crazy.

1232
01:24:09,350 --> 01:24:10,480
Okay then.

1233
01:24:10,850 --> 01:24:12,480
I'll take it down to the police.

1234
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:13,560
I'm sure they can tell us

1235
01:24:13,570 --> 01:24:15,820
what your little
birthday treat is made of.

1236
01:24:24,620 --> 01:24:26,500
You stupid little whore.

1237
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:28,790
I know I've been
a bad roommate, but...

1238
01:24:28,830 --> 01:24:30,120
Isn't this a bit much?

1239
01:24:30,290 --> 01:24:31,500
What the hell?

1240
01:24:31,630 --> 01:24:32,790
Oh, I don't know.

1241
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:35,210
Maybe because you wouldn't
stop sleeping with him.

1242
01:24:35,420 --> 01:24:36,800
What?

1243
01:24:37,420 --> 01:24:38,800
Gregory?

1244
01:24:41,220 --> 01:24:44,220
But he just kept choosing you
over me.

1245
01:24:45,010 --> 01:24:47,810
I guess all he wanted
was a cheap slut like you!

1246
01:24:48,730 --> 01:24:52,810
Wait, you've been killing me
over some stupid guy?

1247
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:55,190
Oh, that's not the only reason.

1248
01:24:56,110 --> 01:24:58,190
You're a dumb bitch, too!

1249
01:24:59,700 --> 01:25:01,490
What I really wanna know is,

1250
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:05,910
How did you figure it out?

1251
01:25:06,410 --> 01:25:08,120
Because you've killed me before.

1252
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,420
Then I guess I'm just
gonna have to do it again.

1253
01:25:36,820 --> 01:25:38,070
Stop.

1254
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:39,740
No! Bitch!

1255
01:25:39,940 --> 01:25:41,070
Fuck you.

1256
01:25:41,570 --> 01:25:42,570
No!

1257
01:25:43,450 --> 01:25:44,950
What the hell's going on in there?

1258
01:25:45,570 --> 01:25:48,740
Nothing. Tree just fell.
Everything's fine.

1259
01:25:48,950 --> 01:25:50,950
Whatever.
Clumsy hos.

1260
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:52,480
I better see you
at the meeting today.

1261
01:25:52,490 --> 01:25:53,670
We'll be there.

1262
01:25:56,750 --> 01:25:58,460
Eat it, bitch!

1263
01:26:00,490 --> 01:26:07,490
P_S_A_G_M_E_N_O.COM

1264
01:26:36,670 --> 01:26:38,670
What are you losers
doing in there?

1265
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,090
Lori

1266
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:42,010
ate

1267
01:26:44,010 --> 01:26:45,300
my cupcake.

1268
01:26:56,020 --> 01:26:58,230
<i>I just knew there was
something wrong with Lori.</i>

1269
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:00,020
<i>She never wore makeup.</i>

1270
01:27:00,230 --> 01:27:02,030
<i>Never posted any cute selfies.</i>

1271
01:27:02,230 --> 01:27:04,650
<i>And she literally
owned a pair of Crocs.</i>

1272
01:27:04,860 --> 01:27:06,740
<i>All the signs
of a psycho killer would...</i>

1273
01:27:06,950 --> 01:27:08,030
<i>Hello?</i>

1274
01:27:08,070 --> 01:27:09,950
<i>I'm trying to get
interviewed here.</i>

1275
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:13,870
Oh, my God, she is such a tool.

1276
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,080
<i>Anyhoo...</i>

1277
01:27:15,290 --> 01:27:16,870
<i>Lori's little plot was super lame.</i>

1278
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:19,210
<i>Poisoning a cupcake?
Really?</i>

1279
01:27:19,420 --> 01:27:21,710
<i>We're Kappas.
We don't eat cupcakes.</i>

1280
01:27:22,090 --> 01:27:23,920
<i>Is this local or national?</i>

1281
01:27:24,090 --> 01:27:25,090
<i>Local.</i>

1282
01:27:25,590 --> 01:27:27,720
- Hey, Dad. Dad.
<i>- Tree, are you okay?</i>

1283
01:27:28,090 --> 01:27:29,890
- Are you hurt?
- Dad, no, Dad. I'm fine.

1284
01:27:30,100 --> 01:27:31,310
I promise.

1285
01:27:31,510 --> 01:27:32,810
<i>- Are you sure?</i>
- Yeah.

1286
01:27:33,220 --> 01:27:35,100
Just a little scratched up.

1287
01:27:35,140 --> 01:27:37,990
<i>- All right.</i>
- Okay. I'll see you soon.

1288
01:27:38,020 --> 01:27:40,020
<i>- I love you.</i>
- I love you, too. Bye.

1289
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:42,870
So uh, now that your

1290
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:45,900
bedroom is officially
a crime scene and all.

1291
01:27:46,110 --> 01:27:47,990
Where are you
planning on crashing?

1292
01:27:49,410 --> 01:27:51,700
Is that an invitation?

1293
01:27:52,790 --> 01:27:54,790
You sure you wanna wake up
in the dorm room again?

1294
01:27:56,620 --> 01:27:58,120
Only if it's yours.

1295
01:28:00,710 --> 01:28:02,800
Only of course, you'll have to
sleep in Ryan's bed.

1296
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,550
- Of course.
- Yeah.

1297
01:28:05,670 --> 01:28:07,550
We can, you know...

1298
01:28:09,260 --> 01:28:10,550
Oh, uh...

1299
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:13,060
I almost forgot.

1300
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:15,140
You left this little guy.

1301
01:28:19,350 --> 01:28:20,560
Thanks.

1302
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:24,150
Hey, you know what your
little scenario reminds me of?

1303
01:28:24,180 --> 01:28:25,540
- What?
- Uh...

1304
01:28:25,570 --> 01:28:27,160
- What's that?
<i>- Groundhog Day.</i>

1305
01:28:27,190 --> 01:28:28,780
The movie <i>Groundhog Day</i>?

1306
01:28:28,990 --> 01:28:31,410
- I don't know.
