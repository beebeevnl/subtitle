3
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,566
You know how I came up with the
idea for the Triple-X program?

4
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,070
Skateboards and swimming pools.

5
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,844
Skateboards used to be
stuck on the ground.

6
00:03:52,868 --> 00:03:57,438
Adolescent transportation.
Then 1977 happens.

7
00:03:57,473 --> 00:03:59,718
Big drought hits
Southern California.

8
00:03:59,742 --> 00:04:01,008
Got so bad,

9
00:04:01,044 --> 00:04:03,922
rich suburbanites couldn't afford
to fill their swimming pools.

10
00:04:03,946 --> 00:04:06,447
That's when
the light clicked on.

11
00:04:06,482 --> 00:04:09,494
Some kid figured out he could
skate those empty pools

12
00:04:09,518 --> 00:04:12,320
and get some real nasty air.

13
00:04:12,355 --> 00:04:16,324
<i>Dogtown and Z-Boys.</i> You ever seen it?
It's a movie.

14
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:17,325
Doesn't matter.

15
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,662
Anyhow, our hero starts
doing things on a board

16
00:04:21,697 --> 00:04:23,798
that no one's ever seen before.

17
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:27,802
Things the world thought
were impossible.

18
00:04:27,837 --> 00:04:31,606
Now,
that kid needed that drought.

19
00:04:31,641 --> 00:04:35,343
The world needed
those empty pools.

20
00:04:35,378 --> 00:04:36,644
That's why Triple-X.

21
00:04:45,655 --> 00:04:48,956
Do you feel safer today
than you felt yesterday?

22
00:04:48,991 --> 00:04:50,625
I know I don't.

23
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,894
The biggest, most expensive
military in the world,

24
00:04:53,929 --> 00:04:57,431
and we're still scared of shoe and
tighty-whitey bombs at the airport.

25
00:04:57,466 --> 00:04:58,665
Why is that?

26
00:04:58,701 --> 00:05:02,403
Because soldiers are built to
take orders and fight wars.

27
00:05:02,438 --> 00:05:06,507
But we, my friend,
are not at war.

28
00:05:06,542 --> 00:05:09,377
We are at peril.

29
00:05:09,412 --> 00:05:11,813
That's why Triple-X.

30
00:05:12,948 --> 00:05:14,326
What's the matter?
You on a diet?

31
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,590
You ain't hungry?

<font color=#4aa5ff>(SPEAKING PORTUGUESE)</font>

33
00:05:17,687 --> 00:05:19,398
So? It's lunch or dinnertime
somewhere in the world.

34
00:05:19,422 --> 00:05:21,789
Come on, eat up!

35
00:05:21,824 --> 00:05:23,535
You know who does feel safe?

36
00:05:23,559 --> 00:05:25,671
The men in charge.
The world beaters.

37
00:05:25,695 --> 00:05:29,864
The top-shelf, par excellence
ayatollahs with all the "dollahs."

38
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:32,077
And that's because
those righteous bastards,

39
00:05:32,101 --> 00:05:34,835
somewhere along the way,
made a deal with the devil.

40
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,938
They traded liberty
for safety. And us,

41
00:05:37,973 --> 00:05:39,674
we the people,

42
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:43,411
ended up losing both.
That's why Triple-X.

43
00:05:43,446 --> 00:05:45,813
While everybody else
is stuck on the ground,

44
00:05:45,848 --> 00:05:49,717
we're doing shit on the board
nobody's ever even seen before.

45
00:05:49,752 --> 00:05:52,030
<font color=#4aa5ff>(SIGHS)</font> Well, that's my pitch.

You're exactly the kind

At the end of the day,

00:06:52,148 --> 00:06:55,383
it comes down to the same

this is the device that crashed

the satellite
and killed Gibbons.

79

Nerds in the lab have
coined it "Pandora's Box."

80
00:08:16,565 --> 00:08:20,201
My team backtracked the satellite's
last signal input to Miami.

81
00:08:20,236 --> 00:08:22,937
Some asshole living the high life
at the Ritz-Carlton penthouse

82
00:08:22,972 --> 00:08:25,072
thought he could
hold the world ransom.

83
00:08:25,107 --> 00:08:28,709
Three flashbangs, two bullets,
and one body bag later,

84
00:08:28,744 --> 00:08:30,511
we took custody of the device.

85
00:08:30,546 --> 00:08:32,680
We must have over 100

to prevent some punk with a

crash a satellite out of the sky

00:16:16,011 --> 00:16:18,479
And line the pockets of some
boardroom billionaires?

154
00:16:20,015 --> 00:16:21,648
You know,

155
00:16:21,683 --> 00:16:25,219
these days, a regular guy
can't afford to be regular.

156
00:16:26,221 --> 00:16:28,989
<font color=#4aa5ff>(GRUNTS)</font>
Let's go.

163
00:17:39,761 --> 00:17:41,362
I know the feeling.

164
00:17:42,631 --> 00:17:46,166
Running from your problems
never works out.

165
00:17:46,201 --> 00:17:47,601
You need a new plan.

166
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,370
I need a new map.

167

<font color=#4aa5ff>(LAUGHS)</font>

Don't say I didn't warn you.

Oh, boy.

172
00:18:44,426 --> 00:18:46,726
Here we go again.

173
00:18:46,761 --> 00:18:48,796
Down! Get down!
Don't move, asshole!

174
00:18:51,533 --> 00:18:53,467
On your knees now,
you son of a bitch!

175
00:18:53,502 --> 00:18:55,346
Okay, okay.
I want to comply.

176
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:57,770
I really wanna comply.
But you're confusing me.

177
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,551
"Don't move, you asshole."

178
00:18:59,575 --> 00:19:02,153
"On your knees, you son
of a bitch." Which is it?

179
00:19:02,177 --> 00:19:03,387
You have three
seconds to comply!

180
00:19:03,411 --> 00:19:04,522
You're not good at this.

181
00:19:04,546 --> 00:19:05,756
One!

182
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,780

00:19:24,466 --> 00:19:26,467
Come on out, Frankenstein!

186
00:19:27,602 --> 00:19:30,504
Gibbons! Gibbons?

187
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:32,873
Olly-Olly-oxen-free.

188
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:39,713
Wow. You really do look
different, Gibbons.

189
00:19:39,748 --> 00:19:41,314
Did you lose weight?

190
00:19:41,349 --> 00:19:44,451
Augustus always had such, well,

191
00:19:44,486 --> 00:19:47,421
not exactly nice things
to say about you.

192
00:19:49,357 --> 00:19:51,391
When did you
realize it was all fake?

193
00:19:51,426 --> 00:19:53,260
You mean the clown show?

194
00:19:53,295 --> 00:19:55,795
You had a guy over there
wearing $1,000 Beats

195
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:58,176
when you can buy the
knockoff for half the price.

196
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,677
Or the lady that was running

197
00:19:59,701 --> 00:20:02,313
to catch a bus that doesn't
leave for two hours.

198
00:20:02,337 --> 00:20:03,948
Or the security guard over there

199
00:20:03,972 --> 00:20:05,850
buying a soda with
foreign currency?

200
00:20:05,874 --> 00:20:07,818
Oh, you know
what the kicker was?

201
00:20:07,842 --> 00:20:09,954
Clarence from
<i>It's a Wonderful Life.</i>

202
00:20:09,978 --> 00:20:11,789
The nice old man
that you had sit down

203
00:20:11,813 --> 00:20:14,281
next to me with
the bag of bombs?

204
00:20:14,316 --> 00:20:16,597
Just happened to
know I spoke English.

205
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:18,552
Go figure.

206
00:20:18,587 --> 00:20:19,764
The bullets could've been real.

207
00:20:19,788 --> 00:20:22,268
Then the body armor
would've been real.

208
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:26,726
I don't know you, but...
I don't like to be tested.

209
00:20:26,761 --> 00:20:30,797
Gibbons never believed you were dead!
Never stopped looking for you.

210
00:20:31,733 --> 00:20:32,966
Hell of a friend.

211
00:20:33,001 --> 00:20:37,237
Yeah, well, the joke's on him.
'Cause we were never friends.

212
00:20:37,272 --> 00:20:39,573
Oh, trust me, he's not laughing.

213
00:20:39,608 --> 00:20:41,942
Nor will he ever again,
for that matter.

214
00:20:46,481 --> 00:20:48,459
<font color=#ffff80>MARKE:</font> I've never seen
anything like it.

215
00:20:48,483 --> 00:20:50,217
This group is lethal,

216
00:20:50,252 --> 00:20:53,253
and they don't care
who or what gets in their way.

217
00:20:53,288 --> 00:20:54,788
I was hoping you'd be interested

218
00:20:54,823 --> 00:20:56,790
in headlining
the next fight card.

219
00:20:56,825 --> 00:20:59,793
<font color=#ffff80>XANDER:</font> Seventy feet across,
90 feet down.

220
00:20:59,828 --> 00:21:01,995
Three inches of security glass?

221
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:06,366
No rope. No line. No chute.

222
00:21:06,401 --> 00:21:08,368
I bet they had a blast.

223
00:21:08,403 --> 00:21:10,937
We ran facial IDs on
every database in the world.

224
00:21:10,972 --> 00:21:14,741
Nothing. Not even a match
on a speeding ticket.

225
00:21:14,776 --> 00:21:17,510
They're ghosts,
in a day and age where

226
00:21:17,545 --> 00:21:19,680
that kind of thing
is almost impossible.

227
00:21:20,515 --> 00:21:22,349
Okay,

228
00:21:22,384 --> 00:21:24,618
you get that I
don't work for suits.

229
00:21:24,653 --> 00:21:28,521
What makes you think I'm gonna
want to ruin all their fun?

230
00:21:28,556 --> 00:21:32,459
Well, if you won't do it for me,

231
00:21:33,561 --> 00:21:34,828
do it for Gibbons.

232
00:21:36,665 --> 00:21:38,765
Your country needs you,
Mr. Cage.

233
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,834
The Triple-X
program needs you.

234
00:21:41,803 --> 00:21:44,304
It's time to be a patriot.

235
00:21:44,339 --> 00:21:46,340
By whose definition?

236
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:56,383
The last time I was patriotic,
I got three strikes.

237
00:21:56,418 --> 00:21:59,286
And there was only one man
who believed in the underdog.

238
00:21:59,854 --> 00:22:01,655
Patriotism is dead.

239
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:03,657
There's only
rebels and tyrants now.

240
00:22:03,692 --> 00:22:05,292
So, which are you?

241
00:22:11,466 --> 00:22:13,433
I'm Triple-X.

242
00:22:17,472 --> 00:22:19,306
Well, welcome back, Triple-X.

243
00:22:25,747 --> 00:22:28,815
Uh, where are you going?

244
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:31,685
London.
Why? What's in London?

245
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,853
A ghost hunter.

246
00:22:33,955 --> 00:22:35,555
And possibly my fur coat.

247
00:22:37,992 --> 00:22:40,427
<font color=#4aa5ff>(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)</font>

248
00:23:16,631 --> 00:23:19,999
I'd forgotten how beautiful
the view is up here.

249
00:23:20,034 --> 00:23:22,769
Oh, I, uh, see
you found your coat.

250
00:23:22,804 --> 00:23:24,971
Well, you promised
to take care of it for me.

251
00:23:25,006 --> 00:23:26,106
And I did.

252
00:23:27,509 --> 00:23:29,153
So, I'm looking for someone.

253
00:23:29,177 --> 00:23:32,145
Since when have we had
a business relationship?

254
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:35,649
I get caught even touching a
computer, my ass goes away for 20.

255
00:23:37,719 --> 00:23:39,085
<font color=#ffff80>XANDER:</font> Name your price.

256
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,787
You know I'm good for it.

257
00:23:42,557 --> 00:23:44,891
Information like this
doesn't have a price.

258
00:23:44,926 --> 00:23:47,160
<font color=#ffff80>XANDER:</font> Ainsley,
everything has a price.

259
00:23:47,195 --> 00:23:49,073
Now, if you don't think
you can pull it off,

260
00:23:49,097 --> 00:23:52,399
if you lost your edge, just
tell me and I'll understand.

261
00:23:52,434 --> 00:23:54,044
You wanna know what it is, Cage?

262
00:23:54,068 --> 00:23:55,168
What?

263
00:23:55,203 --> 00:23:57,404
I used to think
you were the man.

264
00:23:57,439 --> 00:23:58,938
But now,

265
00:23:58,973 --> 00:24:00,173
I don't know, maybe I feel

266
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:01,728
like you're just
working for him.

267
00:24:02,444 --> 00:24:03,710
Come on.

268
00:24:05,113 --> 00:24:07,046
Nobody knows I'm here.

269
00:24:07,081 --> 00:24:09,816
And you know how I am
about keeping secrets.

270
00:24:09,851 --> 00:24:13,052
So you say, but Interpol's
got these new listening bugs.

271
00:24:13,087 --> 00:24:16,055
They're practically invisible.
Real MI6 kind of shit.

272
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:18,591
Disappear on your skin,
under your arms,

273
00:24:18,626 --> 00:24:20,894
tied around your balls
like a Christmas bow.

274
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,563
Unwrap me, then.

275
00:24:28,169 --> 00:24:29,803
You know,
studies have proven that

276
00:24:29,838 --> 00:24:32,806
sexual consummation
irrevocably ruins

277
00:24:32,841 --> 00:24:35,675
nine out of 10 relationships.

278
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:38,578
Lucky for me,
you love to gamble.

279
00:24:38,613 --> 00:24:39,846
Of course...

280
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,450
not.

281
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:47,721
My friends, on the other hand,
adore stiff odds.

282
00:24:49,157 --> 00:24:50,857
Stiff odds?

283
00:24:53,228 --> 00:24:54,995
<font color=#4aa5ff>(WOMEN GIGGLE)</font>

284
00:24:58,533 --> 00:24:59,699
Hmm.

285
00:25:01,269 --> 00:25:04,471
<font color=#4aa5ff>(MUSIC PLAYING)</font>

286
00:25:19,787 --> 00:25:22,489
The things I do for my country.

287
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,829
Like finding needles
in a stack of needles.

288
00:25:29,964 --> 00:25:33,533
Even though you're shackled
by the Queen,

289
00:25:33,568 --> 00:25:35,735
you're still
the best in the world.

290
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:37,804
Thank you.

291
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:40,807
Do yourself a favor.
Burn this.

292
00:25:40,842 --> 00:25:41,941
The whispers I hear,

293
00:25:41,977 --> 00:25:44,143
these ghosts of yours
are the real kind of trouble.

294
00:25:44,178 --> 00:25:45,890
They've got training,
they've got funding,

295
00:25:45,914 --> 00:25:47,580
and they've got no
problem running over

296
00:25:47,615 --> 00:25:49,749
anyone who gets in their way.

297
00:25:49,784 --> 00:25:51,929
Okay, so, you're worried
that I might get hurt?

298
00:25:51,953 --> 00:25:54,954
I'm worried you might get dead.

299
00:25:54,989 --> 00:25:56,901
You know, I'm touched
that you can imagine

300
00:25:56,925 --> 00:25:58,258
a world without me in it.

301
00:26:02,897 --> 00:26:04,498
It'll be a little less fun.

302
00:26:06,234 --> 00:26:08,735
That's all I'm saying.

303
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:11,204
<font color=#4aa5ff>(THUNDER RUMBLING)</font>
<font color=#4aa5ff>(SIGHS)</font>

304
00:26:17,879 --> 00:26:21,180
Your ghosts are hanging out
in the Philippines.

305
00:26:21,215 --> 00:26:23,683
Figures they'd
go to the Pacific.

306
00:26:25,019 --> 00:26:27,587
Some jungle rave
that's off the grid.

307
00:26:27,622 --> 00:26:29,923
How the hell did you
find it so quickly?

308
00:26:29,958 --> 00:26:31,825
Undercover work.

311
00:27:07,261 --> 00:27:11,164
Where is it? What did you
do with Pandora's Box?

312
00:27:11,199 --> 00:27:13,066
It's in a safe place.

313
00:27:14,302 --> 00:27:16,937
That wasn't a part of the plan.

314
00:27:19,807 --> 00:27:20,673
After all these years,

315
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:23,710
you're still shocked
when I improvise?

316
00:27:23,745 --> 00:27:26,212
No. But the mission
was to destroy it.

317
00:27:26,247 --> 00:27:27,658
Turns out there's a new mission.

318
00:27:27,682 --> 00:27:31,951
I'm not gonna destroy the one thing
I can use to get what we want.

319
00:27:31,986 --> 00:27:33,920
The whole world
is looking for us, Xiang.

320
00:27:33,955 --> 00:27:35,989
Let them come!

321
00:27:36,024 --> 00:27:38,925
You worry about pawn sacrifice.

322
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,794
I got my eye on the king.

323
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,964
That's the problem.

324
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,968
You forgot the queen.

325
00:27:58,246 --> 00:28:00,847
<font color=#ffff80>MARKE:</font> After your success
taking down Anarchy 99,

326
00:28:00,882 --> 00:28:03,950
Gibbons was
handed a blank check.

327
00:28:03,985 --> 00:28:06,953
Which is the long way of saying

328
00:28:06,988 --> 00:28:09,355
he got you a new ride.

329
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:12,225
World went and got an upgrade
since you died, Cage.

330
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:16,029
Onboard drones,
anti-air countermeasures,

331
00:28:16,064 --> 00:28:17,964
and fuel tanks big enough

332
00:28:17,999 --> 00:28:21,234
to circumnavigate the globe three
times without ever landing.

333
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,340
You can check your coat.

334
00:28:27,375 --> 00:28:29,776
I promise you,
no one would dare steal it.

335
00:28:29,811 --> 00:28:32,045
I can't guarantee
it won't walk off on its own.

336
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,446
Wheels up in 10, boys!

337
00:28:33,481 --> 00:28:35,859
Which means you're already
seven minutes behind.

338
00:28:35,883 --> 00:28:38,752
Is she always this much fun,
or just on special occasions?

339
00:28:47,095 --> 00:28:49,095
Wow.

340
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:52,265
No wonder our country's
in debt trillions of dollars.

341
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,734
Do you really need all these
gadgets to get the bad guys?

342
00:28:54,769 --> 00:28:57,070
Oh, we don't need any of it.

343
00:28:57,105 --> 00:28:59,906
But it makes the catching
a hell of a lot more fun.

344
00:28:59,941 --> 00:29:01,041
Hmm.

345
00:29:04,746 --> 00:29:07,847
Xander Cage. Holy shit!

346
00:29:07,882 --> 00:29:11,484
Live and in concert, one night only.
This is crazy!

347
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:15,088
I was at Coachella and Guns
N' Roses got back together,

348
00:29:15,123 --> 00:29:17,356
but this is way cooler.

349
00:29:17,391 --> 00:29:19,959
Well, I wasn't
actually there, but I, like,

350
00:29:19,994 --> 00:29:21,427
heard about it, you know?

351
00:29:21,462 --> 00:29:23,229
I'm still talking. Oh, my God.

352
00:29:23,264 --> 00:29:25,142
I'm sorry,
it's like a bad habit.

353
00:29:25,166 --> 00:29:28,178
I get started and then I can't
stop and then I can't...

354
00:29:28,202 --> 00:29:29,269
Breathe.

355
00:29:30,872 --> 00:29:31,971
Take your time.

356
00:29:32,006 --> 00:29:34,340
I know
mouth-to-mouth if necessary.

357

358
00:29:36,244 --> 00:29:38,144
Wow.

359
00:29:38,179 --> 00:29:41,047
Wow! Are you kidding
me with those guns?

360
00:29:41,082 --> 00:29:43,049
You're like
the frickin' Terminator!

361
00:29:43,084 --> 00:29:44,862
And I'm not talking
about the first Terminator,

362
00:29:44,886 --> 00:29:45,852
but the second Terminator

363
00:29:45,887 --> 00:29:47,164
that goes back
to kill the first Terminator.

364
00:29:47,188 --> 00:29:48,755
It was the liquidy metal guy.

365
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,790
Agent Clearidge
worked closely with Gibbons.

366
00:29:50,825 --> 00:29:53,059
She'll handle
support for the operation.

367
00:29:53,094 --> 00:29:55,534
And I bet a guy like you
needs a lot of support.

368
00:29:55,563 --> 00:29:57,997
What are you?
Like 220? 230?

369
00:29:58,032 --> 00:30:01,367
Be honest. 250 is the hard
max for my swing. <font color=#4aa5ff>(LAUGHS)</font>

370
00:30:01,402 --> 00:30:02,913
Oh, come on.
I'm kidding.

371
00:30:02,937 --> 00:30:04,548
It's not like I have a
safe word, or anything.

372
00:30:04,572 --> 00:30:06,205
It's "kumquat."

373
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,141
Never really think about it.

374
00:30:08,176 --> 00:30:09,942
Kumquat.

375
00:30:09,977 --> 00:30:11,421
What about you?
<font color=#4aa5ff>(CHUCKLES)</font>

376
00:30:11,445 --> 00:30:13,813
No. "Safe" isn't
in my vocabulary.

377
00:30:13,848 --> 00:30:16,415
Touche. You are Xander Cage.
<font color=#4aa5ff>(CHUCKLES)</font>

378
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:19,463
Anything you need, Becky can
source it within the hour.

379
00:30:19,487 --> 00:30:21,498
Except for any
sort of illegal drugs.

380
00:30:21,522 --> 00:30:23,256
Those,
I'll have within 15 minutes.

381
00:30:24,592 --> 00:30:26,159
Kidding.

382
00:30:26,194 --> 00:30:28,071
But if you need
a fifty of Purple Urkle,

383
00:30:28,095 --> 00:30:31,097
I am not the girl to ask.

384
00:30:31,132 --> 00:30:32,965
<font color=#ffff80>MARKE:</font> Okay, Cage, follow me.

385
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,368
I'll introduce you
to your ground team.

386
00:30:35,403 --> 00:30:37,537
Thank you, Becky.
Of course.

387
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:39,940
Kumquat.

388
00:30:43,211 --> 00:30:46,179
Hey, here comes the Red Bull
freak show.

389
00:30:46,214 --> 00:30:48,314
<font color=#ffff80>MARKE:</font> Xander Cage,
I want you to meet Paul...

390
00:30:48,349 --> 00:30:49,849
<font color=#ffff80>XANDER:</font> Donovan.

391
00:30:49,884 --> 00:30:52,118
Captain Paul Donovan.

392
00:30:52,153 --> 00:30:55,388
I know you. I saw you on TV!

393
00:30:55,423 --> 00:30:56,834
The President gave him a medal.

394
00:30:56,858 --> 00:30:59,136
That must have been
pretty cool, right?

395
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:03,396
You guys must have some
seriously cool stories to tell.

396
00:31:03,431 --> 00:31:05,264
Must've seen a lot.

397
00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:06,999
I wonder,

398
00:31:07,034 --> 00:31:09,235
how many of you have ever pulled

399
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:11,404
a freestyle triple backflip

400
00:31:11,439 --> 00:31:15,007
on a BMX bike before?
All of you?

401
00:31:15,042 --> 00:31:17,009
No. We don't play on bikes.

402
00:31:17,044 --> 00:31:18,889
<font color=#ffff80>XANDER:</font> Oh,
you don't play on bikes.

403
00:31:18,913 --> 00:31:21,614
Any of you ever carve an R4

404
00:31:21,649 --> 00:31:23,416
on a snowboard

405
00:31:23,451 --> 00:31:26,419
while an avalanche
is on your booty?

406
00:31:26,454 --> 00:31:29,889
We're soldiers, hotshot.
Not slackers.

407
00:31:29,924 --> 00:31:31,424
<font color=#ffff80>XANDER:</font> Okay, but you all

408
00:31:31,459 --> 00:31:34,227
have HALO jumped
over Eastern Europe

409
00:31:34,262 --> 00:31:37,563
using a standard-issue armor
deployment parachute system.

410
00:31:37,598 --> 00:31:38,965
Am I right?

411
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,300
No. We're not all jacked up on

412
00:31:41,335 --> 00:31:43,369

you asshole.

your own transportation
to the island.

Yo, why don't we just nuke this
bitch from orbit and call it a day?

461
00:35:36,237 --> 00:35:38,604
Pandora's Box is one of a kind.

462
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:40,639
It needs to be recovered intact.

<font color=#ffff80>TENNYSON:</font> Why? What's it do?

464
00:35:42,776 --> 00:35:45,344

It killed Gibbons.

465
00:35:45,379 --> 00:35:48,214
All you need to know.
The rest is classified.

466
00:35:48,249 --> 00:35:49,482
Brainwave scrambler.

467
00:35:49,517 --> 00:35:50,757
<font color=#4aa5ff>(SNIFFING)</font> You smell that?

468
00:35:50,784 --> 00:35:53,352
Smells like the same shit
in a different suit.

469
00:35:53,387 --> 00:35:56,489
You think a dog knows
how to work a Frisbee?

470
00:35:56,524 --> 00:35:59,692
Master says, "Fetch,"
and the bitch listens.

471
00:35:59,727 --> 00:36:02,428
You would look so sexy
with a Frisbee in that mouth.

<font color=#ffff80>MARKE:</font> Oh, sweetheart,
this is not a game.

00:36:10,871 --> 00:36:11,837
Oh, hell, no.

477
00:36:11,872 --> 00:36:14,240
I dropped your soldiers
over Eastern Europe.

478
00:36:14,275 --> 00:36:15,241
So, why did you
leave Lassie behind?

479
00:36:15,276 --> 00:36:18,444
This is my operation!
You will listen to me.

00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,435
You've got to
tighten the strap...

485
00:36:44,371 --> 00:36:45,838
over here.

486
00:36:45,873 --> 00:36:47,773
I got this.

487
00:36:47,808 --> 00:36:49,708
What are you, my handler?
<font color=#4aa5ff>(CHUCKLES)</font>

488
00:36:49,743 --> 00:36:51,510
I'm whatever you need.

489
00:36:51,545 --> 00:36:53,846
I can handle anything.

490
00:36:53,881 --> 00:36:55,781
And I've got a tight grip.

491
00:36:55,816 --> 00:36:58,517
And just so you know,
I am not a field agent.

492
00:36:58,552 --> 00:37:01,520
I do not go out in the field.
Ever.

493
00:37:01,555 --> 00:37:03,923
Now,
that's where all the fun is.

494
00:37:03,958 --> 00:37:06,458
Yeah, fun scares me.

495
00:37:06,493 --> 00:37:08,594
People scare me.
Guns scare me.

496
00:37:08,629 --> 00:37:09,973
People with guns
really scare me.

497
00:37:09,997 --> 00:37:11,664
And if I'm scared,
I can't do my job.

498
00:37:11,699 --> 00:37:13,632
And if I can't do my job,
then people die.

499
00:37:13,667 --> 00:37:15,935
And if people die,
then who am I tech-supporting?

500
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:17,670
Literally no one.

501
00:37:17,705 --> 00:37:20,673
But I will make
sure to keep you safe.

502
00:37:20,708 --> 00:37:23,068
It ain't easy to keep me safe.

503
00:37:25,479 --> 00:37:26,879
<font color=#ffff80>NICKS:</font> Whoa.

504
00:37:26,914 --> 00:37:29,949
Yeah, these bad boys

505
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:31,483
They're called exo-gloves.

506

DARPA's new ground

507
00:37:33,587 --> 00:37:34,965
Pneumatic pistons

508
00:37:34,989 --> 00:37:38,457
quadruple the speed
and power of your punches.

509
00:37:38,492 --> 00:37:39,959
Uh, uh-uh-uh...

510
00:37:39,994 --> 00:37:41,827
Nope, nope.

511
00:37:41,862 --> 00:37:44,830
This is a multistage
signal disruptor.

512
00:37:44,865 --> 00:37:47,266
It's very, very breakable.

513
00:37:47,301 --> 00:37:49,779
Can you tell me the real
reason behind the crash of

514
00:37:49,803 --> 00:37:51,804
Pan Am Flight 103
over Lockerbie?

515
00:37:53,574 --> 00:37:55,007
Yes.
Ah.

519
00:37:59,513 --> 00:38:00,657
I wasn't kidding when I said

520
00:38:00,681 --> 00:38:02,381
there's enough
force in these bad boys

521
00:38:02,416 --> 00:38:05,718
to probably punch a hole
through the fricking plane.

522
00:38:05,753 --> 00:38:08,454
Keep screwing around.
What could possibly go wrong?

That is my style, though. Yeah, good.

Oh, you know, actually,

00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:18,864
I would rather if you didn't...

526
00:38:18,899 --> 00:38:20,399
Oh.

527
00:38:20,434 --> 00:38:21,467
That's refreshing.

528
00:38:21,502 --> 00:38:23,469
You actually know

00:45:16,817 --> 00:45:18,350
Hiding from the world.

615
00:45:19,086 --> 00:45:21,186
But not you.

616
00:45:21,221 --> 00:45:23,088
You're not here to hide.

617
00:45:24,091 --> 00:45:25,658
You're looking for someone.

618
00:45:29,763 --> 00:45:32,231
And who's to say
I haven't already found her?

619
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:39,215
Was that meant to scare me?

620
00:45:39,239 --> 00:45:41,240
A little tremble would be nice.

621
00:45:42,509 --> 00:45:44,710
Well,

622
00:45:44,745 --> 00:45:47,846
considering you're one tremble
away from limping out of here...

623
00:45:47,881 --> 00:45:49,248
<font color=#4aa5ff>(GUN COCKS)</font>

624
00:45:50,517 --> 00:45:53,051
I'd say I'm close enough.

625
00:45:53,086 --> 00:45:54,230
Does this mean
you're not making me

626
00:45:54,254 --> 00:45:55,387
breakfast in the morning?

627
00:45:59,092 --> 00:46:01,260
I'd say you're
a couple inches off.

628
00:46:07,267 --> 00:46:09,101
Bit of a stalemate.

629
00:46:09,136 --> 00:46:11,103
Not if you drop the gun.

630
00:46:11,138 --> 00:46:13,138
I'm not the bad guy.

631
00:46:14,541 --> 00:46:16,975
I don't believe in good guys.

00:46:24,851 --> 00:46:27,085
We just met.

635
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:30,856
But we were getting along
famously until somebody

636
00:46:30,891 --> 00:46:33,125
decided to interrupt.

637
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,426
Stick to the path.

638
00:46:35,228 --> 00:46:36,361
Here, honey.

that shirt is in one of them.

<font color=#4aa5ff>(CHUCKLES)</font>

642

intend to push your luck?

643
00:46:49,576 --> 00:46:52,010
Until I get what I came for.

644
00:46:52,045 --> 00:46:53,345
Which is what exactly?

648
00:47:22,609 --> 00:47:26,445
So, let's be real and talk
about what we all really want.

649
00:47:34,321 --> 00:47:36,555
I'm only here for that.

650
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:38,901
And in my mind, you guys
could walk away nicely.

651
00:47:38,925 --> 00:47:41,593
Unless you want to
continue our foreplay.

652
00:47:41,628 --> 00:47:43,962
Power like that doesn't belong
in anyone's hands.

653
00:47:46,099 --> 00:47:47,499
Just improvising.

654

<i>Mate, seriously? A grenade?</i>

655
00:47:57,444 --> 00:47:59,622
What is this? Eastern
Europe in the early '90s?

656
00:47:59,646 --> 00:48:01,286
Next, he's gonna send you a fax.

<font color=#4aa5ff>(SNICKERS)</font>

658
00:48:02,515 --> 00:48:03,982
So, you're willing to kill

659
00:48:05,085 --> 00:48:07,085
just to keep that for yourself?

660
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:09,600
That's the wrong
question to ask.

661
00:48:10,123 --> 00:48:11,523
What's the right question?

662
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:15,527
"Are you willing
to die for it?"

663
00:48:21,668 --> 00:48:24,236
One grenade, three people.

664
00:48:24,271 --> 00:48:25,838
I like the odds.

665
00:48:31,678 --> 00:48:35,046
Two grenades, three people.

666
00:48:35,081 --> 00:48:37,382
I'm loving these odds.

You ever bleed so much,

669
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:45,534
when you open your eyes,
all you see is red?

670
00:48:45,558 --> 00:48:48,526
When you have fought war
on every continent...

671

<font color=#ffff80>ADELE:</font> Come on, X,

673
00:48:53,033 --> 00:48:54,399
You expect death.

<i>Our bodies are
such fragile things.</i>

675
00:48:56,436 --> 00:48:57,676
Come on. Let me shoot him.

676
00:48:57,704 --> 00:48:59,438
Death sometimes just

677
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,173
sneaks up on you.

678
00:49:02,208 --> 00:49:03,474

I'm in this hospital bed.

681
00:49:08,648 --> 00:49:10,660
I'm barely conscious.
Delirious.

682
00:49:10,684 --> 00:49:12,617
Drowning in my own blood.

683
00:49:12,652 --> 00:49:16,288
And all I can hear myself
think is, "Today's the day."

684
00:49:16,323 --> 00:49:18,056
"Today's the day you die."

685
00:49:19,326 --> 00:49:21,159
I'm touched.

686
00:49:21,194 --> 00:49:22,705
Can I have my jacket,
when you get a sec?

687
00:49:22,729 --> 00:49:25,563
Then a man comes along,
tells me a story

688
00:49:25,598 --> 00:49:29,301
about a drought in California.

689
00:49:29,336 --> 00:49:31,736
About skateboards
and swimming pools.

690
00:49:32,472 --> 00:49:35,373
About a man named Xander Cage.

691
00:49:35,408 --> 00:49:38,010
Oh, shit. He's Triple-X.

692
00:49:42,415 --> 00:49:43,682
I heard he was dead.

693
00:49:47,153 --> 00:49:48,420
Is he?

694
00:49:51,157 --> 00:49:53,992
We are all Triple-X.

695
00:49:54,027 --> 00:49:56,267
We just have different agendas.

696
00:49:56,763 --> 00:49:58,430
She wants to destroy it.

697
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:02,334
I'm gonna use it.

698
00:50:02,369 --> 00:50:06,104
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna
let you take it back to the NSA.

728
00:52:02,755 --> 00:52:05,123

803
00:58:59,138 --> 00:59:02,073
We were a new Triple-X team
Gibbons created.

804
00:59:02,108 --> 00:59:04,542
We discovered a high-level
intelligence officer

805
00:59:04,577 --> 00:59:06,811
was trying to
manipulate satellites.

806
00:59:06,846 --> 00:59:09,814
And even before we
could unmask him,

807
00:59:09,849 --> 00:59:11,549
Gibbons was killed.

808
00:59:11,584 --> 00:59:13,751
<font color=#ffff80>XANDER:</font> So, you knew they were
Triple-X all along.

809
00:59:13,786 --> 00:59:16,287
I needed you to retain
a sense of objectivity.

810
00:59:16,322 --> 00:59:18,890
I don't understand.
If I destroyed Pandora's Box,

811
00:59:18,925 --> 00:59:20,691
what happened in Moscow?

812
00:59:20,726 --> 00:59:22,827
If I'm right, which I am,

813
00:59:22,862 --> 00:59:24,662
this box only
ever had the ability

814
00:59:24,697 --> 00:59:26,597
to control one satellite.

815
00:59:26,632 --> 00:59:27,843
What does that mean?

816
00:59:27,867 --> 00:59:30,601
It means we've been

This isn't about Serena.

This is war. And either

823
00:59:51,591 --> 00:59:54,292
we stop it today, or we watch
the world burn tomorrow.

824
00:59:54,327 --> 00:59:56,247
Can't lose focus on that. Yeah.

825
00:59:57,930 --> 00:59:59,141

826
00:59:59,165 --> 01:00:01,109

the old rub-and-tug?

Nobody ever sees me, boss. Good.

830
01:00:08,341 --> 01:00:12,577
<font color=#ffff80>XANDER:</font> Now, these suits control
every spy satellite in the sky.

831
01:00:12,612 --> 01:00:14,723
But how often do these seven men

832

841
01:00:37,203 --> 01:00:39,670

842
01:00:39,705 --> 01:00:42,607
Yo, asshole.

<font color=#4aa5ff>(CHUCKLES)</font>

845
01:00:46,178 --> 01:00:48,079
I'm just doing the math.

846
01:00:48,114 --> 01:00:50,615
Oh, yeah?
What math?

847
01:00:50,650 --> 01:00:53,884
Air velocity
divided by distance.

848
01:00:53,919 --> 01:00:56,754
So, when I stuff
you down the toilet,

849
01:00:56,789 --> 01:00:58,233
search and rescue
will know where

850
01:00:58,257 --> 01:01:00,625
to find you between
China and North Korea.

851
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:02,226
Keep talking shit, little man.

852
01:01:02,261 --> 01:01:04,301
Hold that thought,
G.I. Joe.

853
01:01:04,997 --> 01:01:06,764
Wow.

854
01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:08,066
Roll it back.

855
01:01:09,168 --> 01:01:10,701
A little more.

856
01:01:10,736 --> 01:01:11,736
More.

857
01:01:13,072 --> 01:01:15,406
A little more. Stop.

858
01:01:15,441 --> 01:01:18,142
Okay, when Xiang
broke the window,

859
01:01:22,682 --> 01:01:26,384
he's the only one
that didn't flinch.

860
01:01:26,419 --> 01:01:28,052
I need
the President on the phone...

861
01:01:28,087 --> 01:01:29,798
That's not gonna come off,
you know that, right?

862
01:01:29,822 --> 01:01:32,056
I'll have to replace
the goddamn screen.

863

the director of the CIA

the world for years.

865
01:01:35,895 --> 01:01:39,797
Okay, we have carte Blanche to
track this son of a bitch down.

866
01:01:39,832 --> 01:01:42,400
Do any of you know how to do it?

867
01:01:42,435 --> 01:01:45,103
The same way Xiang and I found
Pandora's Box in New York.

868
01:01:48,174 --> 01:01:50,252
Pandora's Box needs to
keep reconnecting itself

869
01:01:50,276 --> 01:01:52,076
because the satellites orbit.

870
01:01:52,111 --> 01:01:54,211
Excuse me.
Uh.

871
01:01:54,246 --> 01:01:56,947
All we need to do is
track down the main signal,

872
01:01:56,982 --> 01:01:59,917
and then we can approximate its
location within a 20-mile radius.

01:04:25,865 --> 01:04:29,099
It's the most
important one, actually.

923
01:04:29,134 --> 01:04:32,970
It's when I decided to
change the world instead of

924
01:04:33,005 --> 01:04:34,305
rage against it.

He's on the top floor.

I'm showing activity in Pandora's Box.
I can jam the signal,

Did you know traffic signals
were invented by Big Oil

940
01:05:36,335 --> 01:05:38,179
to waste fuel and
drive up profits?

and tell me you
got your eye on me

Just in time.

1072
01:15:05,637 --> 01:15:07,582
Watch out, Cage.
Keep this up,

1073
01:15:07,606 --> 01:15:10,046
people might mistake you
for one of the good guys.

We both know
he's not the bad guy.

1079

And who do we blame for Moscow?

1080
01:15:26,024 --> 01:15:29,759
Better a living terrorist
than a dead company man.

1081

1093
01:16:09,768 --> 01:16:13,136

Yes, minimal casualties.
Triple-X performed

1098
01:16:28,687 --> 01:16:31,522
beyond any reasonable

the Triple-X program

1104

All active agents are to be
erased from record

1105
01:17:01,386 --> 01:17:03,586
and considered
enemies of the state.

01:17:26,878 --> 01:17:28,756
They're gonna start
shooting at us, aren't they?

1114
01:17:28,780 --> 01:17:31,100
Come on!
Clear out, let's go!

1115

1123
01:17:47,165 --> 01:17:48,398
What do we do?

1124
01:17:48,433 --> 01:17:51,234
Just be where
the bullets aren't.

1125
01:17:51,269 --> 01:17:54,838
Sadly, the terrorist
activated Pandora's Box

1126
01:17:54,873 --> 01:17:57,707
one last time
before we could stop him.

1127
01:17:57,742 --> 01:17:59,976
You and your
entire team were lost

1128
01:18:00,011 --> 01:18:03,113
in the blast along
with the device itself.

1129
01:18:03,148 --> 01:18:06,282
If the world thinks
Pandora's Box is gone,

1130
01:18:06,317 --> 01:18:09,285
then they won't know
we're using it to spy on them.

1131
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:11,388
You're just another tyrant.

1132
01:18:11,423 --> 01:18:13,423
No. Patriot.
