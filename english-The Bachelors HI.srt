00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:14,629

- He's the Headmaster.

10
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,417
- What kind of school is it?

11
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:06,128
- Private.

12
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:11,297
- How do you know him?

13
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,383
- College.

14
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:16,761
He dated your mom before I did.

tell you, it's about

the fastest deal I've
ever done in my life.

28
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,051
You know, with a
house, most people

29
00:03:39,051 --> 00:03:42,889
want to look every which way
up and down, round and round.

30
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,348
Not you guys, huh?

31
00:03:44,348 --> 00:03:46,726
You come you look, you
like it you take it.

32
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:47,813
Super fast, huh?

00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:53,414
(cell phone ringing)

34
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,834
- How long you been up?

35
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:11,502
- Awhile.

36
00:04:13,502 --> 00:04:16,964
Yeah Paul dropped off
the box of clothes

37
00:04:16,964 --> 00:04:19,425
from the lost and found, I guess

38
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:22,182
just until we can get
you some new ones.

39
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:28,603
- Do I wear a uniform?

40
00:04:31,603 --> 00:04:33,605
- It's a fancy place.

41
00:04:33,605 --> 00:04:36,714
(upbeat music)

42
00:04:58,714 --> 00:05:02,134
- Please don't tell
me this is all boys.

43
00:05:02,134 --> 00:05:04,432
(upbeat music)

44
00:05:08,432 --> 00:05:09,851
- [Paul] Okay Wes,
we got books check,

45
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:14,064
schedule check,
unacceptable shoes check.

46
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:15,565
- We'll go shopping
right after school.

47
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:16,649
- Great.

48
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,276
So, you pick a sport yet?

49
00:05:19,276 --> 00:05:22,738
- Yeah, I'm not really
a big sports guy.

50
00:05:22,738 --> 00:05:24,783
- Well, I'm afraid
it's mandatory.

51
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:26,492
This time of year
your choices are

52
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:29,286
football, fencing
and cross country.

53
00:05:29,286 --> 00:05:31,331
- [Wes] Okay, thanks,
Mr. Abernac.

54
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,416
- [Paul] Good luck, soldier.

55
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,127
- I don't know how to
thank you for this, Paul.

56
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,045
- No need.

57
00:05:38,045 --> 00:05:39,923
How you holding up?

58
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:41,841
- Fine.

59
00:05:42,841 --> 00:05:45,887
- Well hopefully a fresh start
will do you both some good.

60
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,973
- I'm sure it will.

61
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:52,870
(piano music)

62
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:15,502
- Yes, yes, the first
day hork, gotta love it.

63
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,629
- Alright, alright I'm seeing.

64
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:23,675
I'm seeing some taquitos,
some zucchini...

65
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:26,261
You really like
zucchini, huh, new kid?

66
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:27,137
- I see some jello there.

67
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:30,432
- That's enough forensic
analysis, gentleman.

68
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:35,394
- Gotta respect the first
day hork. (laughing)

69
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:37,487
- Welcome to cross country.

70
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,697
- How was cross country?

71
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:48,661
- Oh it was, whatever.

72
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:55,581
Won't this kind of
remind you of mom?

73
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:59,377
- It's not that I don't
want to be reminded.

74
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:02,009
I just want to have
some control over it.

75
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,096
I want you to have the car.

76
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,182
- What do you mean?

77
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:17,103
- Kid your age aught to
have your own set of wheels.

78
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,774
- How are you gonna get around?

79
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:24,778
- Previous tenant just
left it behind I guess.

80
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:28,156
- You know Dad,
I've never seen you

81
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:31,076
ride a bike in my entire life.

82
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:34,956
- Well I assure I am
perfectly capable of it.

83
00:07:37,956 --> 00:07:39,627
- See you there.

84
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,797
(horn honking)

85
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:44,880
- [Driver] Ass hat!

86
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,341
- Sorry.

87
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:48,970
- God.

88
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,932
- Aw man, you got
Aminheimer for trig?

89
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:57,769
Better get some nose plugs, guy
smells like a dying warthog.

90
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:00,899
- Hey Mason, here
comes the circus.

91
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:03,858
- You know I always expect like

92
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,944
12 midgets to get
out of that thing.

93
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:10,156
- There's one.
(mimics circus music)

94
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,495
- Hey Goober, when do
the elephants get here?

95
00:08:16,495 --> 00:08:19,334
- Aw man, my
favorite time of day.

96
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,425
Behold the muff truck.

97
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,843
- How come we don't get to
take classes at their school?

98
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:34,054
- Because we'd never come back.

99
00:08:34,054 --> 00:08:35,139
Good morning. ladies.

100
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:37,307
- [Girl] Hey Mason.

101
00:08:37,307 --> 00:08:38,393
- [Mason] Hey Kim.

102
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:39,601
- Hey yourself.

103
00:08:39,601 --> 00:08:40,437
- What's up Missy?

104
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,691
- [Missy] Hey Tommy.

105
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,323
(acoustic piano music)

106
00:08:53,323 --> 00:08:54,326
- Hey Lacey.

107
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,245
(guys laughing)

108
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,996
Shut up.

109
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:02,759
(speaking in foreign language)

110
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:56,599
- And the area of this circle
of course is Pi R squared.

111
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:03,147
And then multiply by
the height to give us

112
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,442
the volume of the
cylinder right?

113
00:10:10,442 --> 00:10:11,072
Any questions? Yes?

114
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:15,369
- What's with the belt?

115
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,788
- That's just something I do.

116
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,456
- Freak.

117
00:10:24,456 --> 00:10:25,708
(bell rings)

118
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,961
- And it looks like
we're out of time.

119
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,169
You have the
homework and it's on

120
00:10:29,169 --> 00:10:31,307
the website if
you need to check.

121
00:10:42,307 --> 00:10:44,626
(door shuts)

122
00:11:09,626 --> 00:11:11,341
- So how goes it so far?

123
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,634
- Great, seem like nice boys.

124
00:11:17,634 --> 00:11:18,763
- They're not.

125
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:22,349
They're spoiled little snots
who won't have to work

126
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:23,892
a day in their lives
unless daddy runs off

127
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:27,687
with the secretary and takes
all the money with him.

128
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,482
Just kidding, of course.

129
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:35,945
Bill, I don't want to
overstep my bounds but

130
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:40,908
have you had the chance to
talk to anybody about Jeanie?

131
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:41,037
- I mean,

132
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:47,289
you know once in a while
call my brother or--

133
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:51,878
- I mean a professional,
'cause I happen to know a guy.

134
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:55,215
Got a flawless reputation,
well respected.

135
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,423
Our health plan will
cover everything

136
00:11:56,423 --> 00:11:58,096
so it won't cost you a dime.

137
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:02,721
- I don't know.

138
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:05,725
- Okay look, this
really isn't about you.

139
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,144
You see as long as I
keep up the appearance

140
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,772
of caring about my
staff it maintains

141
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:14,734
my carefully crafted
image of being a good guy.

142
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,235
- Got it, that makes sense.

143
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:19,239
- Yeah I knew
you'd understand so

144
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,202
good idea, terrible idea?

145
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:26,208
- I guess probably a good idea.

146
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,128
- I couldn't help
but notice that those

147
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:35,296
who didn't do well on the test

148
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,841
are also behind
on their homework.

149
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:41,094
So if you want to
improve your grade please

150
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:44,179
I would suggest you pay
attention to your assignments.

151
00:12:44,179 --> 00:12:45,932
Make sense, right? Thank you.

152
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:50,235
I thought you would agree.
(door shutting)

153
00:12:57,235 --> 00:13:00,654
You know I like to think
that I'm a good teacher.

154
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:02,573
But two students
working together

155
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,951
can sometimes be quite helpful.

156
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:09,873
How would you like to be Miss
Westmans's homework partner?

157
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:10,293
- Yeah sure.

158
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,626
- Lacy?

159
00:13:14,626 --> 00:13:15,546
- Yeah.

160
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:18,802
- Thank you, you can go now.

161
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:26,056
- Okay so what's up with
that Lacy Westman girl?

162
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:27,474
- The Princess of Darkness.

163
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,142
- You mean my future wife?

164
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:33,272
- Dude she would have sex with
you and then eat your head.

165
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:35,815
- She going out with anybody?

166
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,399
- Yeah Mason.

167
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,777
- They are not going out.

168
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:40,861
- Oh really well what
would you call it?

169
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:44,448
- Using her whenever
he feels like it.

170
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,951
- Mrs. Oselle asked me to
be her homework partner.

171
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:47,994
- Shut up.

172
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,913
- Dude why the hell doesn't
stuff like that happen to me?

173
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,248
- Because you're nasty

174
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:55,668
and objectionable at
almost every level.

175
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,044
Oh man, we gotta catch up.

176
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,339
You're not gonna
mind if we smoke you?

177
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:00,966
- Go for it.

178
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,177
- Sucks when the little
guy beats you, doesn't it?

179
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,357
- Good luck with Lacy.

180
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,697
(doorbell rings)

181
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,865
- Hi, I'm Lacy's
homework partner.

182
00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:29,452
- [Lacy] Mom, I got it.

183
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:31,830
- You didn't say anything
about a homework partner.

184
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,998
- Mom, I have
a homework partner.

185
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:34,429
Come on.

186
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,389
- You ride horses?

187
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,557
- Look we don't
have to make cordial

188
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,101
chit chat or become
besties okay.

189
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:55,729
The only reason
I'm doing this is

190
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:58,188
she said she'd give
me extra credit,

191
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,606
which I need, because if I fail

192
00:14:59,606 --> 00:15:02,110
then I'd have to do
Junior year over again

193
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,740
and I'd rather put my
head in a wood chipper.

194
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,408
- Okay.

195
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,167
- You can use that chair.

196
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:19,918
I'm sure you've
heard I'm a kind of

197
00:15:19,918 --> 00:15:22,255
freak, slut, basket
case, but I'm afraid

198
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:25,091
any hope you had of us
having wild gymnastic sex

199
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,096
are destined to be frustrated.

200
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:30,517
- Gotcha.

201
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:36,519
- My friends used to
call the version of me

202
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:39,982
before I met Jeanie
PJ for pre-Jeanie and

203
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:46,782
the person I became after we
met was AJ for after Jeanie.

204
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:53,244
Apparently PJ was this
kind of lifeless lump

205
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:55,250
and AJ was a great, fun guy.

206
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:04,008
- How long was it between
her diagnoses and death?

207
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:07,471
- 61 days.

208
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,476
- I'm sorry.

209
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:20,024
So Bill, neurons, neurons that
fire together wire together.

210
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:26,028
So when we're happy the
neurons in our brain

211
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:29,655
align in way that
tends to sustain

212
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,158
that feeling of well being.

213
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:35,370
The same idea also
applies to depression.

214
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,248
Like what you'd expect
during a period of grief.

215
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:41,125
Now grief is completely
normal of course.

216
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,962
But a year or more outside
of a grief inducing vent,

217
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:49,301
I like to see my patients in
more of an emergent posture.

218
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:51,011
The good news is that
we have a battery

219
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,804
of medications available to us

220
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:56,682
to help kick start you
in the right direction.

221
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,351
I'd like to write
you a prescription

222
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,477
for something called Lexapro.

223
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:03,523
It will boost the levels
of serotonin in your brain.

224
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:04,857
And it's likely that you'll feel

225
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,693
a little bit better by
the next time we meet.

226
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,195
Are you comfortable with that?

227
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,579
- If you think it'll help.

228
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,998
- You hungry, sweetie?

229
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:21,458
I can fix you a plate.

230
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:22,666
- You better get
it while you can.

231
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,586
When it comes to your
mom's macaroni salad

232
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:27,422
I wait for no man or boy.

233
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:28,964
- [Wes] So Mom tell us
why of all the things

234
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:30,717
you could have done
on your birthday

235
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:34,471
you chose something
as boring as a picnic.

236
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:39,726
- Because a boring picnic
let's me have my two favorite

237
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:43,355
people in the whole wide
world all to myself.

238
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:46,066
Just being me here makes me feel

239
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:48,236
so very, very very happy.

240
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,321
- Here it comes.

241
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:55,532
Another Jeanie Palet spontaneous
outburst of affection.

242
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:56,742
- I just can't help it.

243
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,994
(all laughing)

244
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:01,955
- [Wes] Okay okay,
make it stop please.

245
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:04,924
(somber music)

246
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,259
- You hungry, sweetie?

247
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,760
I can fix you a plate.

248
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,681
(somber music)

249
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:00,351
Okay you ready?

250
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:06,480
Rules for Wes, part
two, number one.

251
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,155
You will remember that
among life's many joys

252
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,035
it can also be very
hard but just know

253
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:23,997
it has nothing at
all to do with you.

254
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:26,213
You, Wes are a
bright shining star.

255
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:35,596
I'm sorry, can we just stop?

256
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,768
I just love you so much.

257
00:19:44,768 --> 00:19:47,186
Don't ever forget that.

258
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,961
(somber music)

259
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:15,214
- You guys hear about
Taber's party this weekend?

260
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,635
- Please, it's an
exercise in futility.

261
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:23,556
I just want to touch
a girl, like this.

262
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,017
- Stop that immediately.

263
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:28,728
- You know what you
really need, Goob?

264
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,855
You need a girl
you can look up to.

265
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:34,067
(all laughing)

266
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:37,569
- Oh, speaking of which,
how's it going with Lacy?

267
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,364
- Dude I swear if
you transfer in

268
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:43,867
from North San Fran-wherever
and bag Lacy Westman

269
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:46,413
I'm gonna be so pissed.

270
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:48,748
- Yeah I really don't think
you need to worry about that.

271
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:50,333
- Dude, you're her tutor.

272
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,625
You're an authority figure.

273
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,751
Chicks love that.

274
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:56,881
- Think that may be your
fantasy Raf not hers.

275
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:59,425
- Seriously though,
what's the deal?

276
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:03,096
- I don't know man,
there is no deal.

277
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:06,933
I mean as far as I can
tell she hates my guts.

278
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:11,734
- [Gooby] Yeah man,
welcome to my world.

279
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:20,824
(speaking in foreign language)

280
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:24,409
- You know, it's funny,
you French are supposed

281
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:26,702
to be so picky about your coffee

282
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:29,955
but I see you sucking down a
lot of Folgers here, young lady.

283
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,790
- Well, we have to
make do don't we?

284
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,960
- Listen, I got some
primo box seats

285
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,711
for the LA Clips Friday night.

286
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:36,921
What do you say you an me go out

287
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:37,963
we get a couple of cadillac--

288
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,717
- Listen I'm very sorry
but I have to discuss

289
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:44,304
a student right now so
perhaps we can speak later.

290
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:45,057
Thank you.

291
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:48,933
Excuse me?

292
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,728
Sorry I know we
haven't officially met,

293
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:53,145
but if you could
pretend to talk to me

294
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,148
for a minute I would
very much appreciate it.

295
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,776
- [Bill] Okay.

296
00:21:57,776 --> 00:21:59,068
- I'm Carine Oselle.

297
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:00,488
- Hi, Bill Palet.

298
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:03,155
- You know, I don't know if
you have that expression,

299
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,866
but in France sometimes we say

300
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:09,078
better a stranger
than someone you know.

301
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:13,919
- Oh yeah, I think our
expression is anyone but him.

302
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,836
- Your son is in
my class, French.

303
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:18,922
- Yes.

304
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:20,007
- He's very advanced.

305
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:23,679
- Well Wes's mother was fluent.

306
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:26,971
- Was she French?

307
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:27,807
- No.

308
00:22:28,807 --> 00:22:32,144
Michigander actually but
when she was a little girl

309
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:36,647
she heard that French
was a romance language.

310
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:38,566
And she thought
if she learned it

311
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:40,278
her life would be romantic.

312
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:43,449
- Nice, and was it?

313
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:48,327
- I guess it was yes.

314
00:22:49,327 --> 00:22:52,627
(party music playing)

315
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:01,465
- Darwinism is so depressing.

316
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:04,299
If you just so happen to be born

317
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,678
with the traits
girls deem desirable

318
00:23:06,678 --> 00:23:09,638
then your chin deep in the booty

319
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:13,852
but if not then your
left out on the fringe

320
00:23:13,852 --> 00:23:17,022
hoping that one of the alpha
males falls off a cliff

321
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:21,651
or gets eaten by a saber
tooth or some shit.

322
00:23:21,651 --> 00:23:22,736
- Don't forget about being rich.

323
00:23:22,736 --> 00:23:26,076
- That's very true,
instant short cut no doubt.

324
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:31,452
You know what screw this.

325
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:34,580
I'm going home so I can study,

326
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:39,419
get into a good college, get
a good job, and get rich.

327
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:42,422
It's my only hope at this point.

328
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:44,632
See you later, masturbator.

329
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:45,595
- Later.

330
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:51,717
(party music playing)

331
00:24:27,717 --> 00:24:31,057
- Okay that should be...
(speaking in foreign language)

332
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:39,816
- Should this be...
(speaking in foreign language)

333
00:24:42,816 --> 00:24:43,942
Please leave.

334
00:24:43,942 --> 00:24:44,776
- Look I don't want--

335
00:24:44,776 --> 00:24:46,328
- Just wait outside.

336
00:24:56,328 --> 00:25:00,290
- [Annabelle] She's
in trouble, isn't she?

337
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,794
- What do you mean?

338
00:25:02,794 --> 00:25:04,172
- For failing French.

339
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:08,719
- She's not gonna fail.

340
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:11,971
- You're Wes.

341
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:13,015
- You're?

342
00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:16,391
- Annabelle.

343
00:25:16,391 --> 00:25:18,934
- There's a girl at my old
school named Annabelle.

344
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:21,520
We called her Banana Bell.

345
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,522
- That's what Lacy calls me.

346
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:24,606
- Can I call you that?

347
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:25,692
- No.

348
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:26,359
- Why not?

349
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:31,865
- Because it's a privilege
you haven't earned.

350
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:33,700
- No one really makes friendly

351
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,868
conversation in
this house do they?

352
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:38,413
(door lock clicks)

353
00:25:38,413 --> 00:25:41,209
- That means you can go back in.

354
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:45,220
(door shuts)

355
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:57,348
- Promise me you
won't tell anybody.

356
00:25:57,348 --> 00:25:58,516
- Okay.

357
00:25:58,516 --> 00:26:01,313
- No I need to hear you promise.

358
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:04,527
- Promise.

359
00:26:09,527 --> 00:26:11,738
- Yo Palet, you
realize it's been like

360
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:14,074
three weeks since
you last upchucked.

361
00:26:14,074 --> 00:26:17,242
- Oh look at Wes,
growing up so fast.

362
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:20,167
- Wes, can I talk to
you for a moment?

363
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:29,589
Hi, I just wanted to ask how
things are going with Lacy.

364
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:31,925
- They're fine.

365
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:35,887
- Do you think it's helping?

366
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:40,557
- Truth is Mrs. Oselle,
I really don't know.

367
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:42,435
She doesn't say much.

368
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,270
- I see.

369
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,647
Just wanted to check in.

370
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:48,441
Thank you, Wes.

371
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:52,116
(speaking in foreign language)

372
00:26:57,116 --> 00:27:00,970
Mrs. Westman, may
I speak with you?

373
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:17,846
How are you?

374
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:19,807
- Fine.

375
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:23,643
- Working with
Wes, is it helpful?

376
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:25,060
- Yeah.

377
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:25,773
- Good.

378
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:31,151
You know, Lacy, in a lot of ways

379
00:27:31,151 --> 00:27:34,989
you remind me of me
when I was your age.

380
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:37,656
I think we should stick together

381
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:41,663
with all these crazy boys
running around right?

382
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:45,250
So tell me.

383
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,836
How are you?

384
00:27:49,836 --> 00:27:50,009
Really.

385
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:58,471
(somber music)

386
00:27:59,471 --> 00:28:00,805
Come here.

387
00:28:00,805 --> 00:28:01,638
- I'm sorry.

388
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:04,099
- No no no, don't apologize.

389
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:05,518
It's good to cry.

390
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:09,357
Much better than keeping
all that crap inside, right?

391
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:13,734
What time you have
to be back to school?

392
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:14,279
- 2:15.

393
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:18,239
- That's good.

394
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:21,159
That gives us a little time if,

395
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:23,711
if you'd like to talk a bit.

396
00:28:31,711 --> 00:28:34,588
- Why are you doing this?

397
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:38,385
- Because I like you and
because I think maybe

398
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:42,519
you don't have
anyone else to tell.

399
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:48,395
- Hey.

400
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:50,856
- Hey.

401
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:54,108
- Just doing some prep work.

402
00:28:54,108 --> 00:28:57,569
There's too much
shade in the back so

403
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:01,413
plant the garden here, put
in some lettuce and beans.

404
00:29:06,413 --> 00:29:07,872
- You okay, Dad?

405
00:29:07,872 --> 00:29:08,250
- Yeah.

406
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,087
I don't know, maybe a little

407
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:16,049
out of it I guess.

408
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:20,759
Should probably tell the
doc these happy pills

409
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,557
are more like spacey pills.

410
00:29:26,557 --> 00:29:29,435
What a drag your old man is,
huh?

411
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:31,189
Even on drugs, I'm no fun.

412
00:29:33,189 --> 00:29:34,025
- Look, I really don't need you

413
00:29:35,025 --> 00:29:37,238
to be Mr. Smiley
Face all the time.

414
00:29:40,238 --> 00:29:44,994
- Be nice to get a break from
Mr. Droopy though, wouldn't it?

415
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:49,538
Tomatoes, lots of
tomatoes, of course.

416
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:50,623
- Right.

417
00:29:50,623 --> 00:29:52,835
Well Mommatoes technically.

418
00:29:53,835 --> 00:29:55,127
- Still the only
person I've ever known

419
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:57,756
that eats them like apples.

420
00:29:57,756 --> 00:29:59,382
- Right.

421
00:29:59,382 --> 00:30:03,803
Remember in sixth grade
I got in that fight

422
00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:06,638
'cause someone called
her Hottie Tomatie.

423
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,682
- Yeah, you stuck up for her.

424
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:09,310
- Yeah.

425
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,938
- She'd be proud of you, Wes.

426
00:30:13,938 --> 00:30:17,406
Making the adjustment to
a whole new everything.

427
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:28,746
- So exactly how much of
this are you digging up?

428
00:30:29,746 --> 00:30:31,040
- I was thinking all of it.

429
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,125
- All of it, okay.

430
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:37,836
Well let's get to it then,
right?

431
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:38,806
- Feel free.

432
00:30:47,806 --> 00:30:49,182
- What?

433
00:30:49,182 --> 00:30:52,519
- Did you say something
to Mrs. Rousou about me?

434
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:53,271
- No.

435
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,400
Well she did ask about you?

436
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,902
- What'd she say?

437
00:31:00,902 --> 00:31:03,696
- She asked how all
of this was going.

438
00:31:03,696 --> 00:31:05,700
- What'd you say?

439
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,535
- I said I don't know.

440
00:31:08,535 --> 00:31:10,327
- Why would you say that?

441
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:12,792
- 'Cause I don't, I guess.

442
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:18,420
You mad?

443
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,838
- Why would I me mad?

444
00:31:20,838 --> 00:31:22,215
- I don't know.

445
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:26,387
Some people really
don't need a reason.

446
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:30,097
She say something to you?

447
00:31:30,097 --> 00:31:30,060
- Maybe.

448
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,063
- You know,
whenever I talk to you

449
00:31:37,063 --> 00:31:39,566
it kind of feels like
I'm on some dumb cop show

450
00:31:39,566 --> 00:31:40,026
and you're like
the surly suspect

451
00:31:41,026 --> 00:31:44,529
who doesn't want to
give up any information.

452
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:48,324
- She was just being really
nice and I was wondering

453
00:31:48,324 --> 00:31:52,579
if you had said something
about what you saw.

454
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:55,665
- I promised I wouldn't.

455
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:58,125
(knocking on door)

456
00:31:58,125 --> 00:31:59,586
- Yeah?

457
00:31:59,586 --> 00:32:00,878
- Dinner time.

458
00:32:00,878 --> 00:32:02,422
- I'm not hungry.

459
00:32:02,422 --> 00:32:03,714
- [Barbara] You are
hungry and you're eating.

460
00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:05,299
I'm not raising an anorexic.

461
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:06,759
- She said you are
hungry, you're eating,

462
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:08,428
and she's not
raising an anorexic.

463
00:32:08,428 --> 00:32:09,806
- Yeah I heard her.

464
00:32:11,806 --> 00:32:13,767
Mom Wes is here.

465
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:16,442
- [Barbara] So, he
eats doesn't he?

466
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:26,821
- Well this should
be interesting.

467
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:31,701
- Sorry for the complete
absence of flavor, Wes.

468
00:32:31,701 --> 00:32:34,454
It was Lacy's
fathers turn to cook.

469
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:38,625
- Lacy, why don't you
tell your mother that

470
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:41,795
paying the mortgage,
credit cards, tuition,

471
00:32:41,795 --> 00:32:44,422
every other bill that
comes in to this house,

472
00:32:44,422 --> 00:32:46,340
it doesn't leave me much time

473
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:49,344
to cultivate my culinary skills.

474
00:32:49,344 --> 00:32:51,304
- Why don't you
tell her yourself?

475
00:32:51,304 --> 00:32:55,141
- So Wes, are your
parents still together?

476
00:32:55,141 --> 00:32:58,060
- Barbara and Davis are
getting a divorce but

477
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:02,570
on the advice of council
neither is willing to move out.

478
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:11,036
- My mom passed away last year.

479
00:33:15,036 --> 00:33:17,663
- I'm sorry to hear that, Wes.

480
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:18,874
- I'm sorry too.

481
00:33:19,874 --> 00:33:22,925
The difference is
I actually mean it.

482
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:32,429
- Tell me about the belt.

483
00:33:32,429 --> 00:33:34,221
- That's a Jeanie thing.

484
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:38,519
She used to tease me because
my belt would kind of

485
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,564
drift over that way
as the day went on.

486
00:33:42,564 --> 00:33:43,856
Said I should just
start out the day

487
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:45,400
with it where it
was gonna end up.

488
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:49,612
So one day I just
started out with it there

489
00:33:49,612 --> 00:33:51,031
and made her laugh.

490
00:33:52,031 --> 00:33:54,284
She said it was
only fitting because

491
00:33:54,284 --> 00:33:57,537
I was a little off
center to begin with.

492
00:33:57,537 --> 00:33:59,122
- She had a good sense of humor.

493
00:33:59,122 --> 00:34:00,414
- Yeah.

494
00:34:00,414 --> 00:34:01,000
- Okay.

495
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,544
So I find that grieving spouses

496
00:34:04,544 --> 00:34:07,047
usually fall into
one of two groups.

497
00:34:07,047 --> 00:34:08,630
One describes
their loved one as

498
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:11,050
someone who filled
a void in them.

499
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:13,052
The other describes
them as someone who

500
00:34:13,052 --> 00:34:16,514
added a dimension to the
person they already were.

501
00:34:16,514 --> 00:34:20,393
Which would you say
best describes you?

502
00:34:20,393 --> 00:34:21,019
- It's both.

503
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:24,898
- Which would you say you favor?

504
00:34:25,898 --> 00:34:27,983
- All of the above.

505
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:29,904
- Okay, fair enough.

506
00:34:30,904 --> 00:34:35,742
I'm just looking for
something to help us move on.

507
00:34:35,742 --> 00:34:36,702
- From what?

508
00:34:37,702 --> 00:34:40,204
- From your wife, Bill.

509
00:34:40,204 --> 00:34:42,123
The only way you're
going to feel better

510
00:34:42,123 --> 00:34:46,835
is if we figure out someway
for you to let her go.

511
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:49,422
You recognize that don't you?

512
00:34:49,422 --> 00:34:50,800
- Yes.

513
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,179
- Okay.

514
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:59,264
As for the Lexapro finding
the right medication

515
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:01,851
can sometimes be a trial
and error process so

516
00:35:01,851 --> 00:35:04,771
I'm gonna switch you
something called Cymbalta

517
00:35:04,771 --> 00:35:07,690
see if that works
better for you.

518
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:08,529
- Fine.

519
00:35:12,529 --> 00:35:13,989
- [Oselle] Bill?

520
00:35:14,989 --> 00:35:15,782
- Hello.

521
00:35:16,782 --> 00:35:18,451
- What a coincidence.

522
00:35:18,451 --> 00:35:20,286
Back home I'm used to
running into people

523
00:35:20,286 --> 00:35:23,623
but here it always
gives me a surprise.

524
00:35:23,623 --> 00:35:25,583
- [Cashier] Next.

525
00:35:25,583 --> 00:35:26,835
- Excuse me.

526
00:35:27,835 --> 00:35:31,134
Hi Palet, P-A-L-E-T.

527
00:35:34,134 --> 00:35:34,472
- $10.

528
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:44,226
- Bill I'm sorry to
bother you like this but

529
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:46,813
I have a favor to ask.

530
00:35:46,813 --> 00:35:50,818
You know Coach Keith,
big muscles small brain.

531
00:35:51,818 --> 00:35:53,402
- Extra large coffee mug.

532
00:35:53,402 --> 00:35:55,530
- [Oselle] Yes,
ridiculous that mug.

533
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:56,989
- More of a jug really.

534
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:59,284
- I think you could
actually bathe a cat in it.

535
00:35:59,284 --> 00:36:01,702
Anyways he asked
me out for Friday

536
00:36:01,702 --> 00:36:04,956
and I'm desperate for
a reason to say no

537
00:36:04,956 --> 00:36:08,172
but I'm afraid I'm
running out of excuses.

538
00:36:12,172 --> 00:36:15,342
- Oh so you want me
to be your excuse?

539
00:36:16,342 --> 00:36:18,385
- Would you mind terribly?

540
00:36:18,385 --> 00:36:21,472
- No that's, sure that's fine.

541
00:36:21,472 --> 00:36:23,224
- Unless you're busy of course.

542
00:36:23,224 --> 00:36:25,356
- No I'm not busy ever.

543
00:36:30,356 --> 00:36:33,485
I generally eat in the evenings.

544
00:36:34,485 --> 00:36:37,155
We could eat together.

545
00:36:37,155 --> 00:36:40,657
- Yes we can eat together,
that sounds very nice.

546
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:44,286
- Great okay, I'll
see you tomorrow.

547
00:36:44,286 --> 00:36:46,706
- Yes see you tomorrow.

548
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:49,418
- Alright number four.

549
00:36:50,418 --> 00:36:52,628
- I have no idea
how to say that.

550
00:36:52,628 --> 00:36:56,382
(speaking in foreign language)

551
00:36:56,382 --> 00:36:58,842
Do I have to say it like that?

552
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:00,302
- Like what?

553
00:37:00,302 --> 00:37:01,429
- Like I'm an
effeminate French man

554
00:37:01,429 --> 00:37:02,639
who's in love with himself?

555
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:04,391
- Oh that, yeah yeah, you do.

556
00:37:04,391 --> 00:37:05,891
You have to say it like
you're an effeminate

557
00:37:05,891 --> 00:37:07,226
French man who's in
love with himself.

558
00:37:07,226 --> 00:37:11,864
- Then I've got the perfect
homework partner don't I?

559
00:37:19,864 --> 00:37:20,740
- You okay?

560
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,746
- I'm fine.

561
00:37:26,746 --> 00:37:28,914
- Why do you do that?

562
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:30,710
- [Lacy] Do what?

563
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:32,255
- Your arm.

564
00:37:36,255 --> 00:37:38,340
- 'Cause I'm happy,
well adjusted,

565
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:41,219
and really excited
about my future.

566
00:37:41,219 --> 00:37:42,429
Of course I'm a
little upset that

567
00:37:42,429 --> 00:37:44,597
I didn't make
cheerleader this year but

568
00:37:44,597 --> 00:37:46,099
there's always next
year and I feel like

569
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:47,018
if I work really really hard

570
00:37:48,018 --> 00:37:50,777
it could definitely
happen for me.

571
00:37:57,777 --> 00:38:02,532
- So you're telling me
nothing has happened at all.

572
00:38:02,532 --> 00:38:03,909
- Nope.

573
00:38:04,909 --> 00:38:06,036
- You do realize what
a fail this is right?

574
00:38:07,036 --> 00:38:10,331
Not to mention how personally
disappointing this is for me.

575
00:38:10,331 --> 00:38:14,293
You've been with this
girl for over 10 hours.

576
00:38:14,293 --> 00:38:15,461
That's more time than Goober's

577
00:38:15,461 --> 00:38:17,297
spent with a girl
his entire life.

578
00:38:17,297 --> 00:38:20,717
- Hey Palet, tops on
your strategy man.

579
00:38:21,717 --> 00:38:23,137
- What strategy?

580
00:38:24,137 --> 00:38:26,306
- You know, start off
with the psycho whore

581
00:38:26,306 --> 00:38:29,351
and work you way up from there.

582
00:38:29,351 --> 00:38:31,936
Yeah I just hope you're
banging her by now.

583
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:36,152
Trust me it doesn't take half
the work you're putting in.

584
00:38:40,152 --> 00:38:43,782
- That's the other thing
I hate about evolution.

585
00:38:43,782 --> 00:38:47,327
Why does the dominant male
always have to be a dick?

586
00:38:47,327 --> 00:38:48,036
What does persistence
dickishness

587
00:38:49,036 --> 00:38:52,958
have to do with
furthering the species?

588
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:55,793
- Hey Mason.

589
00:38:55,793 --> 00:38:59,172
(loud crashing)

590
00:38:59,172 --> 00:39:02,760
(all talking at once)

591
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,804
- [Paul] Break it
up, break it up.

592
00:39:06,804 --> 00:39:09,181
Get off, break it up,
come on break it up.

593
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:11,018
That's it, that's it,
that's it, break it off.

594
00:39:12,018 --> 00:39:13,521
- Easy easy, boys.

595
00:39:14,521 --> 00:39:19,483
- [Paul] What the hell's
the matter with you guys?

596
00:39:19,483 --> 00:39:23,949
So which one of you Nobel
Lureates started this?

597
00:39:25,949 --> 00:39:28,659
- That depends, sir ,do you
mean verbally or physically?

598
00:39:28,659 --> 00:39:30,744
- Shut up Raffi!

599
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:32,871
I don't really care
who started this.

600
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:34,791
I already talked
to the other three.

601
00:39:34,791 --> 00:39:37,710
And if there is so much
as glancing contact

602
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:39,586
between any of you knuckleheads

603
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:42,047
both parties will be expelled.

604
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:43,215
Is that clear?

605
00:39:43,215 --> 00:39:45,342
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

606
00:39:45,342 --> 00:39:49,889
- Expelled, as in gee why
didn't I get in to college?

607
00:39:49,889 --> 00:39:51,476
Oh right, I got expelled.

608
00:39:53,476 --> 00:39:55,478
Now I can spend the
rest of my sad life

609
00:39:55,478 --> 00:39:59,065
selling mangos from the
side of the freeway.

610
00:39:59,065 --> 00:40:03,277
In the meantime welcome
to disciplinary probation.

611
00:40:03,277 --> 00:40:07,157
You'll also be serving weekend
detention on litter patrol.

612
00:40:07,157 --> 00:40:08,992
Everybody happy?

613
00:40:08,992 --> 00:40:09,202
- Yes, sir.

614
00:40:11,202 --> 00:40:11,036
- Goober.

615
00:40:12,036 --> 00:40:14,121
- Well sir, according
to the honor code

616
00:40:14,121 --> 00:40:16,416
we're supposed to be
honest at all times.

617
00:40:16,416 --> 00:40:20,630
But if I told you I
was happy I'd be lying.

618
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,342
I'm very happy.

619
00:40:25,342 --> 00:40:26,802
- Be gone.

620
00:40:28,802 --> 00:40:32,431
(crickets chirping)

621
00:40:32,431 --> 00:40:34,768
- The truth is I
always imagined that

622
00:40:34,768 --> 00:40:38,313
I would be fantastically
good at marriage.

623
00:40:38,313 --> 00:40:39,356
- You weren't?

624
00:40:40,356 --> 00:40:42,818
- Well it began pretty good and

625
00:40:43,818 --> 00:40:46,654
we found out I could
not have children and

626
00:40:46,654 --> 00:40:50,659
it wasn't so good after
that so I became a teacher.

627
00:40:51,659 --> 00:40:54,079
If you can't be a mother
to one be a mother to many.

628
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:55,954
How long were you married?

629
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:56,291
- 33 years.

630
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:02,128
- Practically a lifetime.

631
00:41:02,128 --> 00:41:05,134
- Well I guess so but
never felt that way.

632
00:41:08,134 --> 00:41:11,887
- What an amazing thing
to be able to say.

633
00:41:11,887 --> 00:41:15,612
(speaking in foreign language)

634
00:41:28,612 --> 00:41:31,157
We're talking about
the food, but you know.

635
00:41:31,157 --> 00:41:35,996
(speaking in foreign language)

636
00:41:36,996 --> 00:41:39,331
- Okay so I obviously
didn't understand

637
00:41:39,331 --> 00:41:43,670
more than two words of
that but this is a little--

638
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:44,588
- Awkward.

639
00:41:45,588 --> 00:41:47,047
I mean I love the
French but one thing

640
00:41:47,047 --> 00:41:49,550
that drives me crazy is how
they babble on endlessly

641
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:52,177
as if anyone around who
doesn't speak French

642
00:41:52,177 --> 00:41:55,264
is simply a piece of furniture.

643
00:41:55,264 --> 00:41:56,266
- Well I do have
more in common with

644
00:41:56,266 --> 00:41:58,018
a La-Z-boy chair
than I like to admit.

645
00:41:59,018 --> 00:42:00,686
- I am that way too.

646
00:42:00,686 --> 00:42:03,023
I mean give me a nice cozy
chair and a good book.

647
00:42:04,023 --> 00:42:06,860
And you'll need a tow
truck to get me to move.

648
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:09,362
- So I guess we
have that in common.

649
00:42:09,362 --> 00:42:14,074
General unwillingness to move
unless absolutely necessary.

650
00:42:14,074 --> 00:42:16,369
- Sometimes I look
at those little fish

651
00:42:16,369 --> 00:42:20,125
you know stuck to the side of
the aquarium, you know the...

652
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:25,628
And I'm like maybe it's
not such a bad life.

653
00:42:25,628 --> 00:42:28,380
- Really, a sucker
fish, not a bad life?

654
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,132
- No, I mean, okay of
course it's bound

655
00:42:30,132 --> 00:42:33,385
to become a little monotonous,
but think about it.

656
00:42:33,385 --> 00:42:34,012
How stressful can it be?

657
00:42:35,012 --> 00:42:37,474
- Well that is
definitely a valid point.

658
00:42:37,474 --> 00:42:40,019
- I mean you have only one job.

659
00:42:42,019 --> 00:42:45,148
(both laughing)

660
00:42:45,148 --> 00:42:45,148
Do you like it?

661
00:42:45,981 --> 00:42:46,940
- Yes excellent, very good.

662
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,525
- I can do a guppy, a guppy.

663
00:42:48,525 --> 00:42:50,710
- [Bill] Oh guppies are fun.

664
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:08,134
(kettle whistling)

665
00:43:13,134 --> 00:43:13,512
- Hey.

666
00:43:15,512 --> 00:43:17,639
- When'd you get back?

667
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:19,976
- A little while ago.

668
00:43:21,976 --> 00:43:24,063
- So, how'd the big date go?

669
00:43:26,063 --> 00:43:27,981
- It went well.

670
00:43:27,981 --> 00:43:28,693
- Well?

671
00:43:29,693 --> 00:43:32,570
Is that a smile I'm seeing?

672
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:34,409
- She's very nice.

673
00:43:37,409 --> 00:43:42,288
What can I say, maybe these
happy pills are working.

674
00:43:42,288 --> 00:43:45,750
- That'd be good, right?

675
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:46,757
- Yeah, sure.

676
00:43:53,757 --> 00:43:56,302
How's the running going?

677
00:43:56,302 --> 00:43:59,557
- I'm starting to
kinda like it actually.

678
00:44:01,557 --> 00:44:05,311
Just wish I was a
little better but...

679
00:44:05,311 --> 00:44:08,898
- Maybe that's something
we can work on.

680
00:44:08,898 --> 00:44:11,483
- We, like me and you?

681
00:44:11,483 --> 00:44:15,489
- Yeah like, doctor Rollins
said I should starts exercising.

682
00:44:16,489 --> 00:44:19,451
Maybe we could run together.

683
00:44:19,451 --> 00:44:21,704
- Yeah, yeah, if you want.

684
00:44:23,704 --> 00:44:26,793
- Okay, now what
about this fight?

685
00:44:28,793 --> 00:44:30,711
- Yeah, no, I know Dad,
it's just,

686
00:44:30,711 --> 00:44:33,548
God this guy he's such a, he's a

687
00:44:34,548 --> 00:44:36,425
what's that thing
Mom used to call

688
00:44:36,425 --> 00:44:38,135
someone she like
really couldn't stand?

689
00:44:38,135 --> 00:44:39,094
- Dingus.

690
00:44:39,094 --> 00:44:39,094
- A dingus, Dad.

691
00:44:39,929 --> 00:44:44,601
This guy I mean he's so much
worse than a dingus it's crazy.

692
00:44:45,601 --> 00:44:47,021
- Okay, but

693
00:44:48,021 --> 00:44:50,190
that doesn't make it
a smart thing to do.

694
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:53,947
- I know, yeah, it's
just it was stupid.

695
00:44:58,947 --> 00:44:59,201
Okay.

696
00:45:01,201 --> 00:45:05,746
Hey Dad, do you mind if kind
of throw some advice your way

697
00:45:05,746 --> 00:45:08,960
if you're gonna
start dating women?

698
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:15,382
You gotta lose
those tighty whiteys.

699
00:45:15,382 --> 00:45:16,882
- Why?

700
00:45:16,882 --> 00:45:20,177
- Well because it's
practically a universal law

701
00:45:20,177 --> 00:45:24,809
that no man has ever
looked good in man panties.

702
00:45:26,809 --> 00:45:28,561
- I'm not sure I
agree with that.

703
00:45:28,561 --> 00:45:31,313
- Well it's just the thing is
it's not really an opinion.

704
00:45:31,313 --> 00:45:32,606
It's kind of a fact.

705
00:45:32,606 --> 00:45:36,318
It's like you can't like
disagree with it, you know.

706
00:45:36,318 --> 00:45:37,737
- [Bill] I don't know.

707
00:45:37,737 --> 00:45:42,492
- Don't start, don't start with
that Dad please stop, okay.

708
00:45:42,492 --> 00:45:46,286
Dad I'm begging you
stop that immediately.

709
00:45:46,286 --> 00:45:47,414
- It's too late it's started,
once it's started--

710
00:45:47,414 --> 00:45:49,248
- Yeah yeah ,alright,
that's my cue.

711
00:45:49,248 --> 00:45:51,753
Alright, night.
See you tomorrow.

712
00:45:53,753 --> 00:45:55,505
- Pleasant dreams.

713
00:45:55,505 --> 00:45:58,222
(upbeat music)

714
00:46:05,222 --> 00:46:07,434
- You always run this fast?

715
00:46:07,434 --> 00:46:09,813
- This is not fast.

716
00:46:12,813 --> 00:46:14,315
- Okay, what about breaks?

717
00:46:14,315 --> 00:46:15,442
You take breaks?

718
00:46:15,442 --> 00:46:16,779
- Nope, no breaks.

719
00:46:19,779 --> 00:46:22,740
- This is just not gonna work.

720
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:23,574
- You okay?

721
00:46:23,574 --> 00:46:24,492
- Yeah yeah, go ahead.

722
00:46:24,492 --> 00:46:25,326
- You sure?

723
00:46:25,326 --> 00:46:27,454
- Go go go, enjoy.

724
00:46:27,454 --> 00:46:28,454
- [Wes] Alright.

725
00:46:28,454 --> 00:46:29,291
- Oh, good Lord.

726
00:46:32,291 --> 00:46:34,798
(upbeat music)

727
00:46:39,798 --> 00:46:42,427
Hey hey, how do you like this?

728
00:46:43,427 --> 00:46:45,472
Come on, Usain Bolt,
let's pick up the pace.

729
00:46:45,472 --> 00:46:47,766
- Dad you're on a bike, okay.

730
00:46:47,766 --> 00:46:50,561
- Yeah, I'm also
way older than you.

731
00:46:51,561 --> 00:46:52,148
What the heck?

732
00:46:55,148 --> 00:46:57,860
Are you trying to ditch me?

733
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:00,152
Come on, pick it up.

734
00:47:00,152 --> 00:47:02,072
Pick it up, pick it up.

735
00:47:02,072 --> 00:47:04,202
(knocking on door)

736
00:47:08,202 --> 00:47:09,998
- Hey jackass.

737
00:47:11,998 --> 00:47:14,291
Starting a fight
to defend my honor.

738
00:47:14,291 --> 00:47:18,295
Like you're some doofus knight
from medieval fantasy land.

739
00:47:18,295 --> 00:47:19,755
- He's a dick.

740
00:47:19,755 --> 00:47:23,346
- Your a dumb ass who's lucky
to still have all his teeth.

741
00:47:26,346 --> 00:47:27,514
- Where are you going?

742
00:47:27,514 --> 00:47:29,980
- [Lacy] You'll see.

743
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:37,400
- What is it?

744
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,869
- Find out.

745
00:47:50,869 --> 00:47:51,038
- Are you serious?

746
00:47:52,038 --> 00:47:55,416
- I'm trying to reduce
your dork factor.

747
00:47:55,416 --> 00:47:57,043
Do you have any idea
how ridiculous you look

748
00:47:57,043 --> 00:47:59,545
driving around without
a passenger seat?

749
00:47:59,545 --> 00:48:00,963
- This is awesome.

750
00:48:00,963 --> 00:48:03,215
I mean,
where'd you even find it?

751
00:48:03,215 --> 00:48:05,844
- Some creepy old
man on Craiglist.

752
00:48:05,844 --> 00:48:07,177
You totally owe me.

753
00:48:07,177 --> 00:48:08,304
- Yeah I do.

754
00:48:09,304 --> 00:48:10,518
Thank you.

755
00:48:13,518 --> 00:48:14,353
- Awkward.

756
00:48:16,353 --> 00:48:18,733
- I was gonna hug you.

757
00:48:19,733 --> 00:48:21,735
- You're allowed.

758
00:48:22,735 --> 00:48:26,905
(acoustic guitar music)

759
00:48:26,905 --> 00:48:27,907
- [Wes] Shit.

760
00:48:27,907 --> 00:48:29,617
- [Lacy] Watch your language.

761
00:48:29,617 --> 00:48:31,494
- Why? You say
shit all the time?

762
00:48:31,494 --> 00:48:32,125
- Shut up.

763
00:48:37,125 --> 00:48:39,460
- Wes what's taking so long?

764
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:42,088

00:49:53,992 --> 00:49:56,663
- [Raffi] I'll slice and
dice you, you vile little orc.

783
00:49:56,663 --> 00:49:58,748
- Why do they call
it litter patrol

784
00:49:58,748 --> 00:50:01,126
if they never pick up litter?

785
00:50:01,126 --> 00:50:05,797
- It's more about being
prepared to pick it up.

786
00:50:06,797 --> 00:50:08,967
- [Annabelle] That's litter.

787
00:50:08,967 --> 00:50:11,760
- Well he likes to give
it a head start first.

788
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,021
- Fine, I'll do it.

789
00:50:22,021 --> 00:50:23,773
- Thanks for coming.

790
00:50:23,773 --> 00:50:25,568
It's a lot less boring.

791
00:50:26,568 --> 00:50:27,735
- You mean you don't
enjoy homoerotic

792
00:50:27,735 --> 00:50:29,030
jousting with your buddies?

793
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:33,240
- You know, I'm just not quite
as good at it as they are.

794
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,038
- I seriously doubt that.

795
00:50:38,038 --> 00:50:42,003
- So Mr. Abernac, he's having
a birthday dinner for may dad.

796
00:50:46,003 --> 00:50:49,965
And I figured you
know after all the

797
00:50:49,965 --> 00:50:53,387
amazing help that I've
given you in French

798
00:50:54,387 --> 00:50:56,186
that maybe you could come.

799
00:51:01,186 --> 00:51:03,646
- Oh my God, did
you just invite me

800
00:51:03,646 --> 00:51:06,068
to a calculus teacher's
birthday party?

801
00:51:08,068 --> 00:51:08,402
- Yeah.

802
00:51:10,402 --> 00:51:11,489
Yeah, I did.

803
00:51:13,489 --> 00:51:16,576
- I don't know, Wes, I mean,
I'm a big girl and all but

804
00:51:16,576 --> 00:51:18,827
that just sounds batshit crazy.

805
00:51:18,827 --> 00:51:21,081
You know math teachers you
get them drunk and then

806
00:51:21,081 --> 00:51:22,748
next thing you know
they're playing

807
00:51:22,748 --> 00:51:26,795
spin the compass and
hide the protractor.

808
00:51:27,795 --> 00:51:28,630
- [Raffi] The girl is mine.

809
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:32,760
- [Gooby] Nay, all young
wenches belong to me.

810
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,722
- So is that a yes or?

811
00:51:38,722 --> 00:51:40,934
- A yes I suppose,

812
00:51:41,934 --> 00:51:45,731
if you can promise me
I'll live through it.

813
00:51:47,731 --> 00:51:49,525
- Everything was
delicious, Missy.

814
00:51:49,525 --> 00:51:51,193
- [Bill] Yes, very
good thank you.

815
00:51:51,193 --> 00:51:52,487
- I'm glad, everyone deserves

816
00:51:52,487 --> 00:51:54,405
a good dinner for
their birthday.

817
00:51:54,405 --> 00:51:56,657
- Speaking of, one more.

818
00:51:56,657 --> 00:51:57,992
- Ah.

819
00:51:57,992 --> 00:52:00,744
- Wes, I just gave
the man bookends.

820
00:52:00,744 --> 00:52:03,289
Why in the world would you
try to compete with that?

821
00:52:03,289 --> 00:52:04,458
- Ah.

822
00:52:06,458 --> 00:52:07,710
- Those are hot.

823
00:52:07,710 --> 00:52:08,795
- [Wes] They are.

824
00:52:08,795 --> 00:52:10,922
- Wes is trying to
convert me to boxers.

825
00:52:10,922 --> 00:52:14,342
- Bill please tell me you're
not still wearing grippers.

826
00:52:14,342 --> 00:52:15,635
- I guess I am.

827
00:52:15,635 --> 00:52:16,969
Thank you, Son.

828
00:52:16,969 --> 00:52:18,512
- Your welcome, Father.

829
00:52:18,512 --> 00:52:19,847
- Well done, Wes.

830
00:52:19,847 --> 00:52:21,932
Now if you could just do
something about the belt.

831
00:52:21,932 --> 00:52:23,434
- No no no, don't lose the belt.

832
00:52:23,434 --> 00:52:24,268
- Are you kidding?

833
00:52:24,268 --> 00:52:25,021
It looks like my calculus
teacher downs three shots

834
00:52:26,021 --> 00:52:28,148
of vodka before he gets
dressed every morning.

835
00:52:28,148 --> 00:52:29,606
- Well it's actually gin, Paul.

836
00:52:29,606 --> 00:52:34,320
- Excuse me, but a man
without quirks is boring.

837
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:35,320
- She's right.

838
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,824
Everyone's entitled to a
few little weirdnesses.

839
00:52:37,824 --> 00:52:39,826
- Like father, like son.

840
00:52:39,826 --> 00:52:41,827
- Excuse me, weirdnesses?

841
00:52:41,827 --> 00:52:43,663
- Hello, backward car seat.

842
00:52:43,663 --> 00:52:46,081
- Hello, you're the one
who gave that to me.

843
00:52:46,081 --> 00:52:47,791
- Okay, pretending
to be a pirate.

844
00:52:47,791 --> 00:52:49,960
- Okay that, that wasn't me.

845
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:52,672
- Whatever, effeminate
French accent.

846
00:52:52,672 --> 00:52:54,715
- There's a lesson here, Wes.

847
00:52:54,715 --> 00:52:56,384
If you expose your
vulnerabilities

848
00:52:56,384 --> 00:52:59,637
to a woman, you
will be eviscerated.

849
00:52:59,637 --> 00:53:03,599
They are a ruthless
cold blooded gender.

850
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:05,684
- Okay it has nothing to do with

851
00:53:05,684 --> 00:53:08,521
the temperature
of our blood okay.

852
00:53:08,521 --> 00:53:11,315
Men are just afraid
of strong women.

853
00:53:11,315 --> 00:53:12,983
They think because
we stand up to them

854
00:53:12,983 --> 00:53:14,277
that means we don't
like them when

855
00:53:14,277 --> 00:53:17,072
half the time it means
it the exact opposite.

856
00:53:17,072 --> 00:53:19,282
- You know, Bill, for
such a mild mannered guy

857
00:53:19,282 --> 00:53:22,409
you sure attract
some feisty women.

858
00:53:22,409 --> 00:53:25,538
I remember being with Jeanie
one night at some bar.

859
00:53:25,538 --> 00:53:27,956
And this giant lecherous redneck

860
00:53:27,956 --> 00:53:29,876
would just not leave us alone.

861
00:53:29,876 --> 00:53:33,213
And finally she said you're
bound to have better luck

862
00:53:33,213 --> 00:53:34,797
at the Natural History Museum.

863
00:53:34,797 --> 00:53:36,548
There's a few gals in there at

864
00:53:36,548 --> 00:53:38,217
the neanderthal
exhibit who would think

865
00:53:38,217 --> 00:53:40,762
you're the greatest
thing that walks upright

866
00:53:40,762 --> 00:53:42,597
and talks at the same time.

867
00:53:42,597 --> 00:53:45,476
(all laughing)

868
00:53:47,476 --> 00:53:50,990
- She did have a way with words.

869
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:04,244
Thank you for the ride.

870
00:54:04,244 --> 00:54:06,748
- Thanks for inviting me.

871
00:54:09,748 --> 00:54:13,585
Your wife sounds like
a very special person.

872
00:54:13,585 --> 00:54:16,755
I cannot think how big
a hole must be left

873
00:54:16,755 --> 00:54:19,385
after losing someone like that.

874
00:54:21,385 --> 00:54:23,936
- Thank you for saying that.

875
00:54:29,936 --> 00:54:32,898
I actually bought
you some flowers

876
00:54:34,898 --> 00:54:37,949
but then I forget
I left them inside.

877
00:54:42,949 --> 00:54:47,786
- Is that some kind of sneaky
way to invite me to come in?

878
00:54:47,786 --> 00:54:48,251
- No, no, I--

879
00:54:53,251 --> 00:54:56,798
No, but, would you
like to come in?

880
00:54:59,798 --> 00:55:01,175
(crickets chirping)

881
00:55:01,175 --> 00:55:02,635
- [Wes] You know
I cannot believe

882
00:55:02,635 --> 00:55:04,346
you said I like
pretending to be a pirate.

883
00:55:04,346 --> 00:55:05,221
- Please, if I wasn't there you

884
00:55:05,221 --> 00:55:07,474
totally would have
been doing it.

885
00:55:07,474 --> 00:55:10,018
- Yeah okay, it's probably true.

886
00:55:11,018 --> 00:55:13,146
- So what's the deal
with your dad and Carine?

887
00:55:13,146 --> 00:55:16,608
I mean she's clearly
got a crush on him.

888
00:55:16,608 --> 00:55:17,320
- Yes.

889
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:22,199
- What?

890
00:55:24,199 --> 00:55:25,992
- I don't know.

891
00:55:25,992 --> 00:55:27,827
He tries to fake it but

892
00:55:28,827 --> 00:55:33,376
inside he's still just nuked.

893
00:55:34,376 --> 00:55:35,336
- You both must be.

894
00:55:37,336 --> 00:55:41,550
- You know, for a long time
we barely even talked.

895
00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:46,722
We didn't go anywhere,
we didn't do anything.

896
00:55:48,722 --> 00:55:52,563
Then one day I just
started doing stuff again.

897
00:55:56,563 --> 00:55:58,237
I kind of felt bad about it.

898
00:56:02,237 --> 00:56:04,864
Like maybe he'd think I
didn't deserve as much.

899
00:56:04,864 --> 00:56:06,907
That wasn't it,

900
00:56:06,907 --> 00:56:10,916
I just can't think about
it all the time you know.

901
00:56:15,916 --> 00:56:19,755
All that does is just
makes it even worse.

902
00:56:20,755 --> 00:56:23,818
(crickets chirping)

903
00:56:41,818 --> 00:56:43,193
What?

904
00:56:43,193 --> 00:56:45,365
- I don't want to do that.

905
00:56:48,365 --> 00:56:49,036
- Why not?

906
00:56:52,036 --> 00:56:55,416
- Because if we do
then you tell somebody

907
00:56:56,416 --> 00:56:57,958
and then they tell somebody
and then pretty soon

908
00:56:57,958 --> 00:56:59,418
the whole school will find out

909
00:56:59,418 --> 00:57:01,755
and then it just
becomes another episode

910
00:57:01,755 --> 00:57:04,173
of let's drink crappy
beer and make out.

911
00:57:04,173 --> 00:57:07,927
High school bullshit
that doesn't mean
anything to anybody.

912
00:57:07,927 --> 00:57:08,762
- So you think I'm the guy that

913
00:57:08,762 --> 00:57:10,387
goes to school and
tells everybody.

914
00:57:10,387 --> 00:57:12,724
- No, I don't know maybe.

915
00:57:13,724 --> 00:57:15,101
- I'm not.

916
00:57:15,101 --> 00:57:16,936
- Yeah, I know I'm just.

917
00:57:16,936 --> 00:57:17,981
- Just what?

918
00:57:20,981 --> 00:57:24,197
- I'd like this to
be better than that.

919
00:57:27,197 --> 00:57:28,824
Look, I like you, okay.

920
00:57:30,824 --> 00:57:33,954
You're gonna make
me say it out loud.

921
00:57:34,954 --> 00:57:36,543
I'd like to go slow.

922
00:57:40,543 --> 00:57:41,920
- Okay.

923
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:43,630
So.

924
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:48,385
What you're saying is
that you like me so much

925
00:57:48,385 --> 00:57:50,472
that you don't want to kiss me.

926
00:57:52,472 --> 00:57:54,306
- Something like that.

927
00:57:54,306 --> 00:57:55,684
- Okay.

928
00:57:55,684 --> 00:57:58,980
I mean at least
not again tonight.

929
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:02,940
- That's right.

930
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:03,818
- But,

931
00:58:04,818 --> 00:58:05,610
maybe,

932
00:58:06,610 --> 00:58:07,320
possibly,

933
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:09,114
later.

934
00:58:10,114 --> 00:58:12,288
- Yes Wesley, maybe
possibly later.

935
00:58:17,288 --> 00:58:19,635
- That's all I needed to know.

936
00:58:31,635 --> 00:58:35,431
- I like what you've
done with the place.

937
00:58:35,431 --> 00:58:36,559
- Yes, thank you.

938
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:41,771
I think it's called
negligent minimalism.

939
00:58:41,771 --> 00:58:44,065
- I hear it's all the
rage in German prisons.

940
00:58:44,065 --> 00:58:46,541
(both laughing)

941
00:59:02,541 --> 00:59:03,710
Would you excuse me?

942
00:59:03,710 --> 00:59:05,224
- Of course, yeah.

943
00:59:18,224 --> 00:59:19,226
- [Carine] Bill.

944
00:59:21,226 --> 00:59:22,695
- Yes.

945
00:59:31,695 --> 00:59:34,400
(piano music)

946
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:09,233
- [Dr. Rollins]
Was being with her

947
01:00:09,233 --> 01:00:11,945
something you wanted to happen?

948
01:00:11,945 --> 01:00:13,612
- Yes.

949
01:00:13,612 --> 01:00:15,407
- [Dr. Rollins] Why?

950
01:00:16,407 --> 01:00:19,702
- I thought it might
take my mind of things.

951
01:00:19,702 --> 01:00:20,413
- Did it?

952
01:00:21,413 --> 01:00:22,289
- No.

953
01:00:23,289 --> 01:00:25,958
- You feel like you were
doing something wrong?

954
01:00:25,958 --> 01:00:26,628
- Yes.

955
01:00:28,628 --> 01:00:30,295
- [Dr. Rollins] Why?

956
01:00:30,295 --> 01:00:32,840
- Because it just made
me think of Jeanie.

957
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:34,967
- Think what exactly.

958
01:00:34,967 --> 01:00:37,889
- That Carine
could never be her.

959
01:00:39,889 --> 01:00:42,226
- No one is replaceable, Bill.

960
01:00:43,226 --> 01:00:45,061
That doesn't mean
someone else can't play

961
01:00:45,061 --> 01:00:47,067
a special role in your life.

962
01:00:51,067 --> 01:00:53,987
Listen, we'll try
a new medication.

963
01:00:53,987 --> 01:00:55,655
And an augmenter
on top of it but

964
01:00:55,655 --> 01:01:00,159
I'm worried one of the
things holding you back

965
01:01:00,159 --> 01:01:02,536
is your own belief
that feeling better

966
01:01:02,536 --> 01:01:05,456
would be a betrayal of Jeanie.

967
01:01:05,456 --> 01:01:08,710
- I don't think that's the case.

968
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:11,963
- The larger point I'm
trying to make here is that

969
01:01:11,963 --> 01:01:14,052
to have a chance
at feeling better

970
01:01:18,052 --> 01:01:20,985
you have to want to feel better.

971
01:01:33,985 --> 01:01:34,237
- Dad?

972
01:01:36,237 --> 01:01:39,753
(contemplative music)

973
01:01:51,753 --> 01:01:52,047
Dad?

974
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:54,007
- Yeah.

975
01:01:56,007 --> 01:01:57,552
- [Wes] You okay?

976
01:01:59,552 --> 01:02:00,847
- I'm fine.

977
01:02:03,847 --> 01:02:04,476
- You sure?

978
01:02:06,476 --> 01:02:07,309
It's pretty late.

979
01:02:07,309 --> 01:02:09,356
- I said I'm fine, Wes.

980
01:02:11,356 --> 01:02:14,112
(contemplative music)

981
01:02:17,112 --> 01:02:19,865
I just need a little air.

982
01:02:21,865 --> 01:02:23,494
I'll come in soon.

983
01:02:24,494 --> 01:02:25,079
- [Wes] Okay.

984
01:02:27,079 --> 01:02:30,612
(contemplative music)

985
01:02:59,612 --> 01:03:02,782
(cell phone buzzes)

986
01:03:03,782 --> 01:03:07,802
(contemplative music)
(parents yelling in distance)

987
01:03:22,802 --> 01:03:25,137
- [Barbara] Do you have
any idea how you sound?

988
01:03:25,137 --> 01:03:27,599
God forbid you spend
one single moment

989
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:30,309
thinking about
anybody but yourself!

990
01:03:30,309 --> 01:03:31,019
- [Davis] Exactly what
I'm talking about.

991
01:03:32,019 --> 01:03:33,605
It's just because
I don't believe

992
01:03:33,605 --> 01:03:35,981
that my life has to
be a living hell.

993
01:03:35,981 --> 01:03:37,608
That's make me wrong.

994
01:03:37,608 --> 01:03:39,318
- [Barbara] Sometimes
you have to be an adult.

995
01:03:39,318 --> 01:03:42,242
(pebbles hitting glass)

996
01:03:47,242 --> 01:03:51,331
- Hey we just picked
up a shit ton of beer.

997
01:03:51,331 --> 01:03:52,170
What do you say?

998
01:03:58,170 --> 01:04:01,385
(loud rock music)

999
01:04:03,385 --> 01:04:04,510
Didn't I tell you?

1000
01:04:04,510 --> 01:04:06,722
The girl can drink.

1001
01:04:07,722 --> 01:04:09,849
- Give me another.

1002
01:04:10,849 --> 01:04:14,353
- There we go, yes,
there we go, drink up.

1003
01:04:14,353 --> 01:04:16,063
She's outdrinking you, Rios.

1004
01:04:16,063 --> 01:04:19,820
(all talking at once)

1005
01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:25,072
- [Boy] Come on Rios.

1006
01:04:25,072 --> 01:04:27,867
- Come on, juice
box, what's this?

1007
01:04:28,867 --> 01:04:31,871
(loud rock music)

1008
01:04:32,871 --> 01:04:34,835
- Come on, man, let's go.

1009
01:04:36,835 --> 01:04:39,795
- Rios, bring him back here.

1010
01:04:39,795 --> 01:04:42,806
(loud rock music)

1011
01:04:50,806 --> 01:04:53,728
(Lacy crying)

1012
01:04:54,728 --> 01:04:57,570
(piano music)

1013
01:05:03,570 --> 01:05:04,114
- Hi, it's Lacy.

1014
01:05:06,114 --> 01:05:08,282
I don't understand
what I'm doing.

1015
01:05:08,282 --> 01:05:11,621
(piano music)

1016
01:05:14,621 --> 01:05:17,250
- You're a smart wonderful girl.

1017
01:05:17,250 --> 01:05:19,418
Just because people around
you want to hurt each other

1018
01:05:19,418 --> 01:05:23,590
doesn't mean you should
do the same to yourself.

1019
01:05:23,590 --> 01:05:26,266
You understand that, don't you?

1020
01:05:34,266 --> 01:05:37,103
- Hey man I'm just
trying to understand

1021
01:05:37,103 --> 01:05:39,230
whether or not you're with her.

1022
01:05:39,230 --> 01:05:42,192
- I promised I
wouldn't talk about it.

1023
01:05:42,192 --> 01:05:45,110
- So that means
there's most certainly

1024
01:05:45,110 --> 01:05:47,907
something to talk about?

1025
01:05:48,907 --> 01:05:50,949
See that right there.

1026
01:05:50,949 --> 01:05:51,951
I knew it.

1027
01:05:51,951 --> 01:05:54,704
How often do you
get to see this?

1028
01:05:54,704 --> 01:05:55,376
True happiness.

1029
01:05:59,376 --> 01:06:01,753
Don't you think that's great?

1030
01:06:01,753 --> 01:06:02,463
- Yeah.

1031
01:06:04,463 --> 01:06:05,298
- What?

1032
01:06:06,298 --> 01:06:08,842
- Nothing. I agree it's cool.

1033
01:06:08,842 --> 01:06:09,927
- [Rios] That was great.

1034
01:06:09,927 --> 01:06:11,804
- [Boy] Yeah who we
picking up next time?

1035
01:06:11,804 --> 01:06:15,608
- [Rios] Whoever Mason
wants, right Mase?

1036
01:06:23,608 --> 01:06:24,943
- [Lacy] Hey.

1037
01:06:25,943 --> 01:06:28,279
- I'm not doing the
homework thing anymore.

1038
01:06:28,279 --> 01:06:29,655
- [Lacy] Wait, why?

1039
01:06:29,655 --> 01:06:31,824
- I don't know, Lacy,
why don't you ask Mason?

1040
01:06:31,824 --> 01:06:34,623
(door slams)

1041
01:06:38,623 --> 01:06:39,000
- Wes, wait.

1042
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,291
Look, I don't know
what you heard but--

1043
01:06:41,291 --> 01:06:42,126
- [Wes] Yeah, I heard enough.

1044
01:06:42,126 --> 01:06:43,420
- Hey, well, I'm sure
that was bullshit.

1045
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:44,586
- [Wes] Yeah, right.

1046
01:06:44,586 --> 01:06:45,422
- Don't laugh at me.

1047
01:06:45,422 --> 01:06:46,840
- How can I not?

1048
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:47,882
At first you tell
me you're afraid

1049
01:06:47,882 --> 01:06:49,800
I'll talk about us and
then what do you do?

1050
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:51,594
You go out with the one
guy who's guaranteed

1051
01:06:51,594 --> 01:06:53,262
to tell the whole
God damn school.

1052
01:06:53,262 --> 01:06:54,722
- We didn't go out,
it wasn't like that.

1053
01:06:54,722 --> 01:06:56,306
- Then what was it?

1054
01:06:56,306 --> 01:06:58,476
- It was just an excuse
to get drunk and--

1055
01:06:58,476 --> 01:06:59,351
- And what?

1056
01:06:59,351 --> 01:07:01,021
- And I don't know,
it was just stupid.

1057
01:07:02,021 --> 01:07:03,356
- Stupid high school bullshit?

1058
01:07:03,356 --> 01:07:04,815
- Yeah.

1059
01:07:04,815 --> 01:07:08,318
- Like you wouldn't do with
me but you will that jackass.

1060
01:07:08,318 --> 01:07:09,030
Who do you do all
this for anyway?

1061
01:07:10,030 --> 01:07:11,072
- Do what?

1062
01:07:11,072 --> 01:07:13,532
- What you do with Mason,
what you do to yourself

1063
01:07:13,532 --> 01:07:15,869
'cause it sure as hell
isn't doing you any good.

1064
01:07:15,869 --> 01:07:17,704
So who's it for huh?

1065
01:07:17,704 --> 01:07:18,954
Is it for your parents?

1066
01:07:18,954 --> 01:07:19,914
'Cause I'm pretty
sure they're too busy

1067
01:07:19,914 --> 01:07:22,041
hating each other
to give a shit.

1068
01:07:22,041 --> 01:07:23,043
- Well, I'm sorry
I can't be like you

1069
01:07:23,043 --> 01:07:25,378
and just pretend like
nothing bothers me.

1070
01:07:25,378 --> 01:07:26,880
I guess I'm just one of
those unfortunate people

1071
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:28,340
who's actually affected by life.

1072
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:30,800
- Okay, for your
information I am affected.

1073
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:32,260
The only difference
is I don't think

1074
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:33,802
the answer is cutting
myself to pieces

1075
01:07:33,802 --> 01:07:35,679
or being Mason Bank's first call

1076
01:07:35,679 --> 01:07:37,556
when he's looking for an
easy piece of late night ass.

1077
01:07:37,556 --> 01:07:40,021
(slap landing)

1078
01:07:43,021 --> 01:07:45,898
- Look, I may be
incredibly messed up,

1079
01:07:45,898 --> 01:07:49,527
and I may do some
incredibly stupid things,

1080
01:07:49,527 --> 01:07:50,945
but at least I'm not
a self righteous prick

1081
01:07:50,945 --> 01:07:51,905
who goes around pretending like

1082
01:07:51,905 --> 01:07:54,458
he's God's perfect little gift.

1083
01:08:04,458 --> 01:08:06,628
- Good luck in French.

1084
01:08:06,628 --> 01:08:09,632
(engine roars)

1085
01:08:10,632 --> 01:08:13,762
(tires squeal)

1086
01:08:15,762 --> 01:08:18,282
(labored breathing)

1087
01:08:36,282 --> 01:08:37,826
(whistle blows)

1088
01:08:37,826 --> 01:08:41,815
(cheering and applauding)

1089
01:09:09,815 --> 01:09:11,943
- Good job today, fellas.

1090
01:09:11,943 --> 01:09:13,613
- Thanks, coach.

1091
01:09:15,613 --> 01:09:16,244
- Hold up, Wes.

1092
01:09:22,244 --> 01:09:24,666
You want to do better don't you?

1093
01:09:26,666 --> 01:09:28,085
- Doesn't matter.

1094
01:09:29,085 --> 01:09:32,631
- It only matters if
it matters to you.

1095
01:09:34,631 --> 01:09:37,844
Look, I'm not exactly
the Vince Lombardi

1096
01:09:37,844 --> 01:09:41,141
of running coaches but
I could tell you this.

1097
01:09:44,141 --> 01:09:46,270
Cross country is all about pain.

1098
01:09:48,270 --> 01:09:53,068
Not denying or it pretending
it doesn't exist but

1099
01:09:53,068 --> 01:09:56,154
recognizing it for
exactly what it is

1100
01:09:57,154 --> 01:10:00,288
and then finding a way
to push through it.

1101
01:10:06,288 --> 01:10:08,344
- Thanks, Mr. Abernac.

1102
01:10:19,344 --> 01:10:20,554
- Bill?

1103
01:10:21,554 --> 01:10:22,555
Hi.

1104
01:10:22,555 --> 01:10:23,390
- Hi.

1105
01:10:23,390 --> 01:10:25,225
- I wanted to thank you again
for inviting me to your party.

1106
01:10:25,225 --> 01:10:27,185
I had a very nice time.

1107
01:10:27,185 --> 01:10:28,020
- Good.

1108
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:32,856
- There's a free concert on
Saturday at McGiffen Park.

1109
01:10:32,856 --> 01:10:36,029
Chopin, Verlouse,
perhaps you'd like to go?

1110
01:10:38,029 --> 01:10:41,615
- I don't think
that's a good idea.

1111
01:10:41,615 --> 01:10:44,077
- You mean the concert or?

1112
01:10:44,077 --> 01:10:45,996
- No, I mean

1113
01:10:46,996 --> 01:10:48,747
you and I spending
more time together.

1114
01:10:48,747 --> 01:10:52,095
I don't think that's a good
idea for either one of us.

1115
01:11:02,095 --> 01:11:04,680
- I'm sorry if I pushed you.

1116
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:05,890
- You didn't.

1117
01:11:05,890 --> 01:11:09,685
- I did and I should
have known better.

1118
01:11:09,685 --> 01:11:13,648
Saturday, it doesn't
have to be a date.

1119
01:11:13,648 --> 01:11:14,606
I mean
- Carine, please.

1120
01:11:14,606 --> 01:11:15,734
- We can listen to music and--

1121
01:11:15,734 --> 01:11:17,234
- Please.

1122
01:11:17,234 --> 01:11:20,488
You're a lovely wonderful woman.

1123
01:11:20,488 --> 01:11:23,574
Any man would be
crazy not to see that.

1124
01:11:23,574 --> 01:11:25,498
But I just, I can't do this.

1125
01:11:31,498 --> 01:11:34,587
I need you to understand that.

1126
01:11:35,587 --> 01:11:36,970
- Yes ,I do.

1127
01:11:44,970 --> 01:11:48,106
- If Y is equal to
the sine of Pi X then,

1128
01:11:56,106 --> 01:11:59,907
then we take the integral
from negative two.

1129
01:12:03,907 --> 01:12:07,164
No positive two to the
endpoint of five over two.

1130
01:12:12,164 --> 01:12:13,167
Then we have the,

1131
01:12:15,167 --> 01:12:18,047
no okay there
should be a DX here.

1132
01:12:20,047 --> 01:12:22,841
(sighs)

1133
01:12:22,841 --> 01:12:25,762
But that's not,
that's not right.

1134
01:12:26,762 --> 01:12:30,185
Okay, a definite integral from
positive two to the end...

1135
01:12:32,185 --> 01:12:36,689
Yes you still have to
square it, don't you, Bill?

1136
01:12:36,689 --> 01:12:39,154
(contemplative music)

1137
01:12:44,154 --> 01:12:45,032
- Yo, Mr. Palet, you alright?

1138
01:12:46,032 --> 01:12:49,202
- Yeah, I just,
just need a minute.

1139
01:12:49,202 --> 01:12:52,978
(suspenseful music)

1140
01:13:14,978 --> 01:13:15,811
- In the old days
they would have

1141
01:13:15,811 --> 01:13:18,439
called it a nervous breakdown.

1142
01:13:18,439 --> 01:13:20,859
- I thought he was
getting better.

1143
01:13:20,859 --> 01:13:22,234
- Unfortunately
it's not uncommon

1144
01:13:22,234 --> 01:13:25,154
for an upswing to
proceed a downturn.

1145
01:13:25,154 --> 01:13:27,489
The thing is Bill's
connection with Jeanie

1146
01:13:27,489 --> 01:13:31,161
was so profound that
his grief is extreme.

1147
01:13:31,161 --> 01:13:35,539
So much so that the emotional
is now becoming physical.

1148
01:13:35,539 --> 01:13:37,625
- Which means what?

1149
01:13:37,625 --> 01:13:41,421
- That if we don't find
a way to turn this around

1150
01:13:41,421 --> 01:13:44,636
as bad as it is now,
it can get worse.

1151
01:13:49,636 --> 01:13:52,771
(horns honking)

1152
01:13:58,771 --> 01:13:59,108
- You okay?

1153
01:14:02,108 --> 01:14:02,943
- Yeah.

1154
01:14:03,943 --> 01:14:08,573
- As long as your dad is here
I want you to stay with us.

1155
01:14:09,573 --> 01:14:10,494
- I'll be fine.

1156
01:14:13,494 --> 01:14:16,372
- Look Wes, we all
could use somebody

1157
01:14:16,372 --> 01:14:18,123
to lean on from time to time.

1158
01:14:18,123 --> 01:14:21,127
- I really appreciate that,
Mr. Abernac, but

1159
01:14:22,127 --> 01:14:23,671
leaning on people
really hasn't worked out

1160
01:14:23,671 --> 01:14:26,716
all that well for me so far so

1161
01:14:26,716 --> 01:14:29,893
just not gonna do it anymore.

1162
01:14:36,893 --> 01:14:39,813
- So we can continue
trying new medications

1163
01:14:39,813 --> 01:14:42,524
but clearly we need to do more.

1164
01:14:42,524 --> 01:14:45,902
I want to see you in my
office three times a week.

1165
01:14:45,902 --> 01:14:48,070
And I'm going to
insist that you start

1166
01:14:48,070 --> 01:14:51,448
going to one of those support
groups that we talked about.

1167
01:14:51,448 --> 01:14:53,868
I also think that
we should discuss

1168
01:14:53,868 --> 01:14:56,412
electroconvulsive therapy.

1169
01:14:56,412 --> 01:14:58,582
Now that may sound extreme.

1170
01:14:59,582 --> 01:15:01,417
But the fact is it's
a far more refined

1171
01:15:01,417 --> 01:15:02,918
treatment than it used to be.

1172
01:15:02,918 --> 01:15:04,671
Its very safe.

1173
01:15:04,671 --> 01:15:06,338
And it's proven to
be highly affective

1174
01:15:06,338 --> 01:15:08,341
in treating sever
depression that's

1175
01:15:08,341 --> 01:15:11,262
unresponsive to other
forms of treatment.

1176
01:15:13,262 --> 01:15:16,890
Given the severity of the
break you just experienced

1177
01:15:16,890 --> 01:15:20,310
I believe it would be a mistake
for us not to consider it.

1178
01:15:20,310 --> 01:15:23,359
(machines beeping)

1179
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:28,820
- Mr. Palet?

1180
01:15:29,820 --> 01:15:32,990
Mr. Palet are you still with us?

1181
01:15:32,990 --> 01:15:33,033
There you are.

1182
01:15:34,033 --> 01:15:37,871
So I'm going to give
you a muscle relaxant

1183
01:15:37,871 --> 01:15:41,623
All you have to do is
relax and take a nice nap.

1184
01:15:41,623 --> 01:15:43,710
How does that sound?

1185
01:15:43,710 --> 01:15:45,377
- Okay.

1186
01:15:45,377 --> 01:15:48,386
(contemplative music)

1187
01:16:34,386 --> 01:16:37,932
- He relished the
moments and I know that

1188
01:16:39,932 --> 01:16:41,688
I'm ever thankful to God

1189
01:16:44,688 --> 01:16:47,652
that I had the
opportunity to spend

1190
01:16:50,652 --> 01:16:54,533
the best part of my
life with this person.

1191
01:16:56,533 --> 01:16:58,493
It's just not the same.

1192
01:16:59,493 --> 01:17:02,359
(upbeat music)

1193
01:17:31,359 --> 01:17:33,823
(bell tolling)

1194
01:17:36,823 --> 01:17:39,658
- Mr. Rios, I think you
will find it difficult

1195
01:17:39,658 --> 01:17:43,891
to pass the final if
I kick you out of it.

1196
01:18:03,891 --> 01:18:04,020
Wes?

1197
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:08,689
How's your father?

1198
01:18:09,689 --> 01:18:10,108
- He's fine.

1199
01:18:12,108 --> 01:18:16,324
- If there's anything I can
do I hope you'll let me know.

1200
01:18:20,324 --> 01:18:22,159
- Don't be last.

1201
01:18:22,159 --> 01:18:25,831
Okay, let's finish
hard, let finish hard.

1202
01:18:26,831 --> 01:18:28,917
(whistle blows)

1203
01:18:28,917 --> 01:18:30,880
Alright, bring it in.

1204
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:37,009
Alright, for those of you
hoping to qualify for SPC

1205
01:18:38,009 --> 01:18:41,680
the trinity quads will be
your final opportunity.

1206
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:43,222
It's also a race
in which we have

1207
01:18:43,222 --> 01:18:46,643
yet to place higher than fourth.

1208
01:18:46,643 --> 01:18:48,728
It's a rather uncomfortable fact

1209
01:18:48,728 --> 01:18:51,564
given that only four
schools participate.

1210
01:18:51,564 --> 01:18:54,567
So please if you bear
me any good will at all

1211
01:18:54,567 --> 01:18:58,363
make sure that you eat a
large carbohydrate filled meal

1212
01:18:58,363 --> 01:19:01,408
and that you're not
late for the bus.

1213
01:19:01,408 --> 01:19:02,449
Martinez.

1214
01:19:02,449 --> 01:19:03,409
- [Martinez] Yeah, coach.

1215
01:19:03,409 --> 01:19:05,579
- [Paul] Okay, that's it.

1216
01:19:07,579 --> 01:19:11,877
- Hey Wes, is it true your
dad is not coming back?

1217
01:19:12,877 --> 01:19:14,962
Dude, that's what
Bobelchek said.

1218
01:19:14,962 --> 01:19:17,131
- Bobelchek's a
brain dead moron.

1219
01:19:17,131 --> 01:19:21,219
- Yeah but, your dad
he's gonna be okay, right?

1220
01:19:21,219 --> 01:19:22,761
- Yeah, of course.

1221
01:19:22,761 --> 01:19:24,680
He so depressed he had
to be hospitalized.

1222
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:26,056
They're done finding a
medication that can help

1223
01:19:26,056 --> 01:19:27,100
so they're just
shooting electricity

1224
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:29,476
straight through his
brain, but yeah, Goob.

1225
01:19:29,476 --> 01:19:30,310
I'm sure everything's
gonna be just

1226
01:19:30,310 --> 01:19:32,440
hunky dory from here on out.

1227
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:37,627
(whistle blowing)

1228
01:19:54,627 --> 01:19:56,216
So, how's the group going?

1229
01:20:00,216 --> 01:20:01,636
- Good.

1230
01:20:04,636 --> 01:20:06,350
- What do you talk about?

1231
01:20:09,350 --> 01:20:12,064
- Things people
have been through.

1232
01:20:14,064 --> 01:20:15,653
- What about the ECT?

1233
01:20:20,653 --> 01:20:22,323
You think it's helping?

1234
01:20:24,323 --> 01:20:25,993
- I'm not sure.

1235
01:20:27,993 --> 01:20:29,163
- Feel any different?

1236
01:20:31,163 --> 01:20:32,792
- Not really.

1237
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:37,185
Dr. Rollins says it
doesn't work for everybody.

1238
01:20:52,185 --> 01:20:55,024
- Why don't you just
get it over with then?

1239
01:20:58,024 --> 01:20:58,403
- Get what?

1240
01:21:01,403 --> 01:21:02,073
- Dying.

1241
01:21:06,073 --> 01:21:09,539
That's what you're
really doing right?

1242
01:21:13,539 --> 01:21:15,708
I know you're depressed.

1243
01:21:15,708 --> 01:21:18,211
And I know that I'm
supposed to be supportive.

1244
01:21:18,211 --> 01:21:19,378
- I'm not asking
you to do anything.

1245
01:21:19,378 --> 01:21:20,672
- Yes you are.

1246
01:21:21,672 --> 01:21:24,592
You're asking me
to just accept it.

1247
01:21:25,592 --> 01:21:29,390
Just sit back, just watch
you die just like Mom.

1248
01:21:31,390 --> 01:21:32,809
- I know this has been hard.

1249
01:21:32,809 --> 01:21:34,228
- Yeah, you think?

1250
01:21:35,228 --> 01:21:39,899
I mean first my mom dies and
then we just pack up and leave

1251
01:21:39,899 --> 01:21:42,569
out of the blue out of nowhere.

1252
01:21:42,569 --> 01:21:44,988
- Wes you're mom and I--

1253
01:21:44,988 --> 01:21:46,907
- Were everything.

1254
01:21:47,907 --> 01:21:48,826
Okay, I know.

1255
01:21:49,826 --> 01:21:50,743
I get it.

1256
01:21:50,743 --> 01:21:54,458
But do you honestly think that
this is what she would want?

1257
01:21:57,458 --> 01:21:58,046
Mom was amazing.

1258
01:22:01,046 --> 01:22:02,796
You think I don't miss her every

1259
01:22:02,796 --> 01:22:05,635
single second of
every single day?

1260
01:22:07,635 --> 01:22:09,762
But here's the headline, Dad.

1261
01:22:09,762 --> 01:22:13,185
She's gone forever and
she's never ever coming back.

1262
01:22:16,185 --> 01:22:17,270
- Wesley, I am so sorry.

1263
01:22:17,270 --> 01:22:18,896
- I don't want sorry!

1264
01:22:18,896 --> 01:22:21,774
(dishes clattering)

1265
01:22:21,774 --> 01:22:23,360
I want my dad back.

1266
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:25,444
- I'm here.

1267
01:22:25,444 --> 01:22:26,613
- No, you're not.

1268
01:22:27,613 --> 01:22:30,286
And you haven't been
for a long time.

1269
01:22:33,286 --> 01:22:36,288
If I'm gonna have to spend
the rest of my life alone

1270
01:22:36,288 --> 01:22:38,707
tell me now 'cause
if you're just gonna

1271
01:22:38,707 --> 01:22:41,127
give up and die than
maybe I should too.

1272
01:22:41,127 --> 01:22:42,127
- Wes, please don't say that.

1273
01:22:42,127 --> 01:22:43,215
- I'm serious!

1274
01:22:45,215 --> 01:22:48,510
That's what this
is all about, right?

1275
01:22:48,510 --> 01:22:51,012
If there's a point to
all this, the living?

1276
01:22:52,012 --> 01:22:55,310
I mean whether it's
worth it to even try.

1277
01:22:57,310 --> 01:22:59,354
Well, make up your
God damn mind, Dad.

1278
01:22:59,354 --> 01:23:01,564
If the answer is no why
don't you just fucking

1279
01:23:01,564 --> 01:23:02,564
kill yourself and
get it over with?

1280
01:23:02,564 --> 01:23:06,069
(glass breaking)

1281
01:23:06,069 --> 01:23:09,576
(suspenseful music)

1282
01:23:13,576 --> 01:23:15,627
(door slams)

1283
01:23:23,627 --> 01:23:26,475
(music fades)

1284
01:23:37,475 --> 01:23:40,742
(contemplative music)

1285
01:23:53,742 --> 01:23:55,578
- [Official] Runners set.

1286
01:23:57,578 --> 01:23:59,082
(gun fires)

1287
01:24:01,082 --> 01:24:04,537
(contemplative music)

1288
01:27:25,537 --> 01:27:27,747
(phone ringing)

1289
01:27:27,747 --> 01:27:28,581
- [Michael] This is Michael.

1290
01:27:28,581 --> 01:27:30,291
- Hello Michael,
it's Bill Palet.

1291
01:27:30,291 --> 01:27:32,335
- [Michael] Bill.
What a surprise.

1292
01:27:32,335 --> 01:27:33,586
How are you?

1293
01:27:33,586 --> 01:27:35,171
- I'm okay, how are you?

1294
01:27:35,171 --> 01:27:37,465
- [Michael] Doing well,
doing well, thanks.

1295
01:27:37,465 --> 01:27:38,635
- Good good.

1296
01:27:40,635 --> 01:27:46,599
Listen, I'm calling
because I know

1297
01:27:46,599 --> 01:27:49,728
you were always a real
supporter of Jeanie's work.

1298
01:27:49,728 --> 01:27:50,645
- [Michael] Oh yeah.

1299
01:27:50,645 --> 01:27:53,314
- And I wonder if the museum
would like to have it.

1300
01:27:53,314 --> 01:27:54,690
- [Michael] Well,
we'd be delighted.

1301
01:27:54,690 --> 01:27:57,819
Any specific pieces
you had in mind?

1302
01:27:57,819 --> 01:27:59,988
- All of it, everything.

1303
01:28:00,988 --> 01:28:02,948
- [Michael] I'm sorry,
did you say all of it?

1304
01:28:02,948 --> 01:28:03,783
- Yeah.

1305
01:28:04,783 --> 01:28:06,911
- [Michael] Bill?

1306
01:28:06,911 --> 01:28:08,704
- I know you'll take
good care of it.

1307
01:28:08,704 --> 01:28:09,622
- [Michael] Of course.

1308
01:28:09,622 --> 01:28:12,181
(upbeat music)

1309
01:28:27,181 --> 01:28:30,110
(cheering and applauding)

1310
01:28:40,110 --> 01:28:43,823
- That's it, you did it,
you did it, kid.

1311
01:28:43,823 --> 01:28:47,827
That was just God
damned extraordinary.

1312
01:28:47,827 --> 01:28:50,204
I'm telling you, that was just

1313
01:28:50,204 --> 01:28:53,958
absolutely God
damned extraordinary.

1314
01:28:54,958 --> 01:28:56,336
Did you guys see that?

1315
01:28:56,336 --> 01:28:59,506
That was incredible, incredible.

1316
01:28:59,506 --> 01:29:02,527
(labored breathing)

1317
01:29:20,527 --> 01:29:22,698
- Dad, Dad, I'm sorry.

1318
01:29:24,698 --> 01:29:25,990
I'm sorry, Dad.

1319
01:29:26,990 --> 01:29:28,368
I didn't mean what I said.

1320
01:29:28,368 --> 01:29:29,743
- I know.

1321
01:29:29,743 --> 01:29:30,537
I know.

1322
01:29:30,537 --> 01:29:31,537
- I'd have never said it.

1323
01:29:31,537 --> 01:29:34,548
- It's okay, you
had every right.

1324
01:29:42,548 --> 01:29:44,220
Listen Wes, Wes, Wes, hey.

1325
01:29:47,220 --> 01:29:48,222
I'm sorry.

1326
01:29:50,222 --> 01:29:52,768
And I'm sorry I missed you race.

1327
01:29:53,768 --> 01:29:56,988
And I'm not gonna miss any more.

1328
01:30:04,988 --> 01:30:07,369
- [Official]
Congratulations, Son.

1329
01:30:12,369 --> 01:30:14,122
- [Bill] Look at that.

1330
01:30:15,122 --> 01:30:16,460
- Can you believe it?

1331
01:30:18,460 --> 01:30:19,421
- Yeah, sure.

1332
01:30:22,421 --> 01:30:25,564
You Wes, are a
bright shining star.

1333
01:30:40,564 --> 01:30:43,364
(doorbell rings)

1334
01:30:48,364 --> 01:30:51,076
- She passed the French final.

1335
01:30:51,076 --> 01:30:52,786
- Glad to hear it.

1336
01:30:52,786 --> 01:30:56,841
- But she's still in
kind of a bad mood.

1337
01:31:07,841 --> 01:31:10,136
- Looks so official.

1338
01:31:10,136 --> 01:31:11,599
- I know, right?

1339
01:31:14,599 --> 01:31:16,643
- So are you like a jock now?

1340
01:31:16,643 --> 01:31:17,270
- Yeah.

1341
01:31:19,270 --> 01:31:22,983
Figured it was time
to kind of rebrand.

1342
01:31:23,983 --> 01:31:25,027
- Yeah, I mean, you did
take awkward new kid

1343
01:31:26,027 --> 01:31:28,654
about as far as you could.

1344
01:31:28,654 --> 01:31:32,324
- And plus you had brooding
loather locked up so

1345
01:31:32,324 --> 01:31:34,829
that was never really an option.

1346
01:31:36,829 --> 01:31:38,914
Heard you passed French.

1347
01:31:38,914 --> 01:31:42,752
- Yeah, just kept hearing your
dorky voice in my head going...

1348
01:31:42,752 --> 01:31:46,520
(speaking in foreign language)

1349
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:02,525
Can we please try this again?

1350
01:32:06,525 --> 01:32:09,114
- You promise me
something first?

1351
01:32:12,114 --> 01:32:13,827
No more Mason.

1352
01:32:15,827 --> 01:32:19,295
- Thought it was gonna
be something difficult.

1353
01:32:25,295 --> 01:32:27,132
- No more hurting yourself.

1354
01:32:30,132 --> 01:32:34,221
- Yeah Carine's been trying
to get me to see some doctor.

1355
01:32:36,221 --> 01:32:38,904
- Promise me you'll go.

1356
01:32:50,904 --> 01:32:52,197
That was okay?

1357
01:32:52,197 --> 01:32:53,238
Too fast for you?

1358
01:32:53,238 --> 01:32:54,073
- Shut up.

1359
01:32:54,073 --> 01:32:54,073
- No, I'm just making sure
'cause

1360
01:32:54,908 --> 01:32:55,949
I don't want to rush
into things, okay.

1361
01:32:55,949 --> 01:32:58,829
- Shut up or I'm
keeping your medal.

1362
01:33:00,829 --> 01:33:02,873
- I was gonna give
it to you anyway.

1363
01:33:02,873 --> 01:33:06,260
(piano music)

1364
01:33:14,260 --> 01:33:16,261
- [Raffi] Hey, welcome
back, Mr. Palet.

1365
01:33:16,261 --> 01:33:17,640
- Thanks.

1366
01:33:19,640 --> 01:33:21,439
- Let's here it for Mr. P.

1367
01:33:26,439 --> 01:33:27,069
- [Bill] Carine.

1368
01:33:31,069 --> 01:33:31,654
- Hello.

1369
01:33:33,654 --> 01:33:34,948
- Hi.

1370
01:33:34,948 --> 01:33:37,202
I was hoping I
would find you here.

1371
01:33:39,202 --> 01:33:40,287
- Well, you did.

1372
01:33:42,287 --> 01:33:43,750
- Yes.

1373
01:33:45,750 --> 01:33:48,043
Do you like ice cream?

1374
01:33:48,043 --> 01:33:50,296
I know that's maybe the
dumbest question I've ever,

1375
01:33:50,296 --> 01:33:52,632
anyone has ever asked anyone.

1376
01:33:53,632 --> 01:33:55,719
Who doesn't like
ice cream, right?

1377
01:33:55,719 --> 01:33:56,552
- Not me.

1378
01:33:56,552 --> 01:33:57,055
- Right.

1379
01:33:59,055 --> 01:34:00,681
Meaning that you do like it?

1380
01:34:00,681 --> 01:34:01,891
- Yeah, I do.

1381
01:34:02,891 --> 01:34:07,564
- Good because we were just
about to go get some and

1382
01:34:07,564 --> 01:34:10,984
I was hoping you'd
like to join us.

1383
01:34:10,984 --> 01:34:12,484
- Who is us?

1384
01:34:12,484 --> 01:34:15,155
- Oh I have Wes
and Lacy with me.

1385
01:34:16,155 --> 01:34:18,658
You know, I figured if
you came along it'd be

1386
01:34:18,658 --> 01:34:22,457
a little less of that awkward
chaperoney kind of vibe.

1387
01:34:25,457 --> 01:34:29,836
- Is that the only reason
you are asking me to come?

1388
01:34:29,836 --> 01:34:31,216
- No, it's not.

1389
01:34:35,216 --> 01:34:36,760
I'm asking you because
I would really like

1390
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:39,556
to spend some time with you.

1391
01:34:42,556 --> 01:34:45,856
