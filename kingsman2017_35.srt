1
0:0:1.601 --> 0:0:3.171
And it broke me.

2
0:0:5.139 --> 0:0:7.574
And now,
if this mission fails...

3
0:0:9.008 --> 0:0:10.343
she's gonna die.

4
0:0:12.346 --> 0:0:14.649
I know it's against
Kingsman rules,

5
0:0:14.681 --> 0:0:16.716
having a relationship.

6
0:0:20.721 --> 0:0:22.522
When I was shot...

7
0:0:22.556 --> 0:0:24.124
can you guess
what the last thing was

8
0:0:24.157 --> 0:0:25.626
that flashed through my mind?

9
0:0:28.095 --> 0:0:31.798
It was absolutely nothing.

10
0:0:34.068 --> 0:0:35.770
I had no ties.

11
0:0:36.470 --> 0:0:39.439
No bittersweet memories.

12
0:0:39.471 --> 0:0:41.541
I was leaving nothing behind.

13
0:0:43.510 --> 0:0:45.780
Never experienced
companionship...

14
0:0:46.779 --> 0:0:48.315
never been in love...

15
0:0:49.416 --> 0:0:51.351
and in that moment...

16
0:0:51.385 --> 0:0:55.088
all I felt was loneliness...

17
0:0:55.122 --> 0:0:56.356
and regret.

18
0:0:57.992 --> 0:0:59.525
I'm sorry.

19
0:0:59.560 --> 0:1:0.595
Don't be.

20
0:1:2.796 --> 0:1:5.333
Just know that
having something to lose...

21
0:1:7.400 --> 0:1:9.836
is what makes life worth living.

22
0:1:10.703 --> 0:1:12.806
Now, let's go
and save your girl.

23
0:1:14.141 --> 0:1:15.843
I missed you, Harry.

24
0:1:21.047 --> 0:1:22.448
Gentlemen.

25
0:1:22.481 --> 0:1:24.385
I hate to break up a party.

26
0:1:24.417 --> 0:1:27.554
We're nearly there,
so I suggest we get ready.

27
0:1:28.855 --> 0:1:29.889
Follow me.

28
0:1:39.666 --> 0:1:41.769
Oh, yes.

29
0:1:49.609 --> 0:1:51.210
(GASPING)

30
0:1:51.244 --> 0:1:52.845
Hello, gorgeous.

31
0:1:52.880 --> 0:1:54.014
I'm Jack. What's your name?

32
0:1:54.047 --> 0:1:56.349
How would you like to ride
home on a real cowboy?

33
0:1:56.383 --> 0:1:57.952
I got a six pack
of cold ones on ice

34
0:1:57.984 --> 0:1:59.152
and my roomie's out all night.

35
0:1:59.185 --> 0:2:2.421
So you can scream my name
as loud as you need to, sugar.

36
0:2:2.456 --> 0:2:5.226
I hate to do this to you, Jack.

37
0:2:5.258 --> 0:2:6.359
Who's this pretty lady?

38
0:2:6.392 --> 0:2:7.794
She's dead.

39
0:2:7.828 --> 0:2:10.430
Cops said wrong place,
wrong time.

40
0:2:10.462 --> 0:2:12.599
Hey, honey. I'm heading
to the grocery store.

41
0:2:17.570 --> 0:2:18.939
My name is Poppy Adams.

42
0:2:25.412 --> 0:2:26.947
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

43
0:2:35.889 --> 0:2:36.923
Ginger.

44
0:2:36.957 --> 0:2:40.394
Goddamn butterfly guy shot me
in the fucking head.

45
0:2:40.426 --> 0:2:41.895
Why would he do that?

46
0:2:42.630 --> 0:2:44.463
(PANTING)

47
0:2:44.498 --> 0:2:46.900
Well, I'm guessing
you didn't fix him right.

48
0:2:46.934 --> 0:2:48.535
And where the hell is he?

49
0:2:48.569 --> 0:2:52.272
He's on his way to Cambodia
with Eggsy and Merlin.

50
0:2:52.305 --> 0:2:54.341
That's where Poppy's base is.

51
0:2:54.374 --> 0:2:56.075
Eggsy's gonna need backup.

52
0:2:56.109 --> 0:2:57.343
Yes, he is.

53
0:2:57.377 --> 0:2:58.813
Get the Silver Pony
on the runway

54
0:2:58.846 --> 0:3:0.047
and ready to take off.
