1
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,429
Kung Fu is not a game,
gentlemen.

2
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:16,590
It is not a religion.

3
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:19,809
It's about who lives
and who dies.

4
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:21,178
You dig?

5
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:23,805
Now, in the street,

6
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,770
you're not gonna have
swords or spears.

7
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:27,559
If it's a brick,

8
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,811
we use a brick.

9
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:32,439
If it's broken glass,

10
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,407
we use broken glass.

11
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:39,826
The idea is to put
the other guy away fast.

12
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,745
That is the Wing Chun style.

13
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:44,868
If you master it...

14
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:47,378
you'll command respect...

15
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,296
wherever you go.

16
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,509
Hey, what was that for?

17
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,003
I heard you've been
gambling again.

18
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:56,088
Everybody gambles in Chinatown.

19
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:57,430
Not my students.

20
00:04:57,923 --> 00:04:58,924
How much you lose this time?

21
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:01,764
Not... not much.

22
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:02,969
How much?

23
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,096
Couple hundred.

24
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:09,276
You gamble the way you fight,
no brains.

25
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:11,653
When the Chenghu town boys
come to collect,

26
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,818
you think they're just gonna
waltz into your punches?

27
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,440
Probably not.

28
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,234
Yeah, probably not.

29
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,277
All right, everybody,

30
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:20,612
get back to work.

31
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,573
Action!

32
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:47,138
What?

33
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:48,974
We ran out of film, Bruce.

34
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,810
Again, Frankie?
This is the big finish.

35
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,486
I know, we're using short ends.

36
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,022
Okay. Reload,
but make it quick.

37
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:57,107
Yeah.

38
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,316
What was the last ass I kicked?

39
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,069
Uh, gangster number four.

40
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,241
Okay. Steve, Vinnie,

41
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,030
you guys reset.

42
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,366
Okay.
The rest of you...

43
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,075
get back on the ground.

44
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,452
Hey, Sifu,

45
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,378
I think you got me in
the nuts on that one.

46
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:12,297
Well, how many times
do I have to tell you?

47
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:14,208
You have to step back
when I kick at you.

48
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,089
- Yeah, well, I'm not gonna be on camera.
- Roll's out.

49
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,886
It's not about you, dipshit.
It's about me.

50
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:21,840
Action!

51
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:30,807
One, two...

52
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:36,398
One, two. One, two.
One, two. One, two.

53
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,106
Sifu...

54
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,193
I just wanted to say thank you
for letting me be in the movie.

55
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,244
No problem.
You're a natural.

56
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,830
You look great
getting your ass beat.

57
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,829
Thanks.
Can I ask you a question?

58
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,252
How am I doing in class?

59
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,078
You work hard.

60
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:54,377
You're even beginning
to develop your own style.

61
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:56,003
What kind of style?

62
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,010
A bad one.
Come, I'll show you.

63
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:11,348
Good.

64
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:18,697
It's good for the kune,
what about the street?

65
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,741
You think you're tough?

66
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:33,874
You think you're street?

67
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:37,257
Come on, show me
where your street is!

68
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,766
Relax, Mac. Mac.
Mac?

69
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:52,856
That's what you got to overcome.

70
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,020
Kung Fu is about discipline,

71
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,772
about channeling what's in here.

72
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,062
In here, out here.

73
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,152
Now, tell me.
Tell you what?

74
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:03,233
Where's all this anger
coming from?

75
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,284
It's nothing. I'm just
frustrated, that's all.

76
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:15,537
Hey, Mac.

77
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:17,831
Didn't mean to
embarrass you in there.

78
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,960
It's fine.
I embarrassed myself.

79
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:25,005
You know, if any one of those
punches would've connected,

80
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,218
you would've knocked me down.

81
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,804
You must've studied
boxing before.

82
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,302
No.

83
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,597
Somebody taught you
how to throw a punch.

84
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,473
Your Dad?

85
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,611
You could say that.

86
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,612
You know what
I was doing in there?

87
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,074
Getting inside your head.

88
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:55,869
If you can psych
the other guy out,

89
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,829
before you even
throw the first punch,

90
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:00,165
you already won.

91
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,090
You're good at doing that.

92
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,474
Look, I'm your Sifu,

93
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,849
I'm not here to tell you
how to live your life.

94
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,059
But I can tell you this...

95
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:19,731
in a fight, a chip on your
shoulder is just extra weight.

96
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:41,539
Hands on the outside.

97
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,218
Looking good though, right?

98
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,422
Not really.

99
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:51,099
But keep at it.

100
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,720
Now get your stuff, get out of here.
I got to start locking up.

101
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,955
Vinnie, Vinnie, Vinnie, my man.

102
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,281
Tony Yu.

103
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:16,871
Long time no see.

104
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,330
I saw you yesterday.

105
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:21,580
The Giants lost, again.

106
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,332
You owe Auntie Blossom money.

107
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:40,849
Get off me!

108
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:42,650
You don't mess with
the Chengu town, Vinnie.

109
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:43,977
Hey!

110
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:52,868
You boys done playing?

111
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:22,186
Clean your boys up,
go back to the north end.

112
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,768
Vinnie will
pay you back tomorrow,

113
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,228
unless you want to deal
with our unfinished business

114
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,313
right here and right now.

115
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,714
- I just hope you learned your lesson.
- Damn right.

116
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,716
Next time I'm going
with the Dodgers.

117
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:51,302
Vinnie, you're gonna get
yourself hurt one of these days.

118
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:54,096
McKee, China Gate order ready.
You drop off.

119
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:55,594
Mm-hmm.
Sure thing, Miss Wei.

120
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:57,509
You still don't use chopsticks.

121
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,553
He's a barbarian, Ma.

122
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,726
You the barbarian.

123
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:05,685
Fight in alley. Get your
feet off of my desk.

124
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:08,186
I love you, Ma.

125
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:10,863
Mm.

126
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:13,567
Wong Jack Man, he's leaving
the Shaolin temple.

127
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:18,204
Really? See, that's a guy who gives
Sifu Lee a run for his money.

128
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,077
I don't know,
I think Sifu still beats him.

129
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:21,532
What's it say?

130
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,660
He's on a pilgrimage...

131
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,542
to check out Kung Fu in America.

132
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,706
He is?
Yeah.

133
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:29,874
Where's he gonna be?

134
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,252
San Francisco.

135
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:44,893
Hey. Here.

136
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,643
Twenty busboy uniform,
eight dozen napkins.

137
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,440
Mm-hmm. Where are
my 60 tablecloth?

138
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,771
Calm down, they're still
in the truck.

139
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,821
I need tablecloth now,
every table dirty.

140
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:55,366
Okay. Okay, I got two hands.
Give me someone to help.

141
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,115
Thank you, for helping me.

142
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,206
You're new around here, right?

143
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:09,831
I'm Steve.

144
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:14,635
Do you speak any English?

145
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,132
No.

146
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:28,983
That was wrong,
I should've, um...

147
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:36,816
That's still wrong.

148
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,117
That sounds like English.

149
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:42,910
I'm not supposed to speak to
anyone outside the restaurant.

150
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:44,407
What's your name?

151
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:45,996
I am Quan Xiulan.

152
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:47,452
Xiulan.

153
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,212
Uh...

154
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,707
May I have those?

155
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,168
Baseball Digest?

156
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:58,588
Yeah, sure.

157
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,508
That's how you learned English.

158
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:05,599
I use what I can get.

159
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:09,307
Hand me the tablecloth.

160
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:14,562
Thank you.

161
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:18,733
That's dangerous, Mac.

162
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,490
You don't want to mess with a Bi Nu
girl who belongs to Auntie Blossom.

163
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:22,570
Who's Auntie Blossom?

164
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:25,532
Auntie Blossom owns the China Gate
but her real job is running rackets

165
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,533
for the Chengu town triad
out of the restaurant, I mean,

166
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:28,826
your girl belongs to them.

167
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,788
At least until she can pay them back
for smuggling her into the country.

168
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:32,963
That's messed up.

169
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,131
Hey, you want some?

170
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,089
What is it?
Barbecued seaworms.

171
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:38,215
Disgusting.

172
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,763
Hey, one man's disgusting
is another man's delicacy.

173
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,182
Oh, you know what the manager
of the Jackson café told me?

174
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,728
What?
Wong Jack Man is coming in

175
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:49,101
on the Jeremiah O'Brien
tomorrow.

176
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:51,224
How do you know that?
'Cause he's Wong's cousin.

177
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,392
Let's go meet him.

178
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,276
What are you gonna say to him?
We're gonna look like idiots.

179
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:55,979
I don't know. I just
want to shake his hand.

180
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:58,694
You're gonna tell Sifu Lee?
Probably not.

181
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:01,002
Excuse me.

182
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:02,591
Ni Hao.

183
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:04,888
Ni Hao.

184
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:15,892
No.

185
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:17,435
Thank you.

186
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:22,114
Perhaps another time.

187
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,321
I'm...
I beg your pardon.

188
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:28,363
You just asked me
to shine your shoes.

189
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,031
Vinnie!
Um...

190
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:34,415
A friend of mine was playing
a joke. A joke, do you...

191
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,129
Yes, I understand.

192
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,462
What may I do
for you, Mr. McKee?

193
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:43,420
Master Wong, I just want to
welcome you to America.

194
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,755
Did someone send a car for you?

195
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,892
I hardly merit such luxury.

196
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,347
You are Master Wong Jack Man,
aren't you,

197
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:55,644
from the Shaolin temple?

198
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,391
Yes.

199
00:16:58,226 --> 00:16:59,603
Well, can I give you a lift?

200
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,993
Thanks for the lift.
Yeah, no problem.

201
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:20,540
Master Wong, I'm...

202
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:22,379
I'm just wondering,
it would be an honor

203
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,257
if you would perhaps give me
a lesson one day or...

204
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,131
You do not have a master?

205
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,468
I belong to the kune
of Sifu Bruce Lee.

206
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:35,646
Yes. I have heard
of Lee Jun-fan.

207
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:36,722
Yeah?

208
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:40,185
If you are a student
of Sifu Lee,

209
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,859
I doubt there is anything
I can teach you.

210
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:55,867
See you, man.
You prick.

211
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,920
I finally meet a living legend
and I ask him to shine my shoes?

212
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,001
Could have been worse.

213
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,172
Really? How?

214
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,342
I could have taught you to say,
"I hear you have a tiny dick."

215
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:07,299
Hey, wait.
Watch your mouth in here.

216
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:09,964
And what do you mean, you
finally met a living legend?

217
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,424
You see me every day.

218
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:12,884
I'm sorry, Sifu.

219
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,685
I was talking
about Wong Jack Man.

220
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,388
What the hell are you talking about?
Sifu, mouth!

221
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,394
Shut up, Vinnie!
How did you meet him?

222
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,483
I heard he was coming
to San Francisco.

223
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:23,812
And I went to, you know,
meet him to shake his hand.

224
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,354
Did he say
what he is doing here?

225
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,065
He said he came to observe.

226
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:28,274
Observe what?

227
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,910
He didn't say, Sifu, but he
did tell me he heard of you.

228
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,207
So, the Shaolin sent Wong
Jack Man to spy on me.

229
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,616
Why would they do that?

230
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,752
When I was a toadae of
Sifu Yip Man in Hong Kong.

231
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,085
Shaolin found out
my Grandmother was white.

232
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,883
You know what they did?
They made him stop teaching.

233
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,970
So when I come to America, I
open up my kune for everybody.

234
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,177
Maybe Shaolin
don't forgive me for that.

235
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:55,055
You really think Master Wong
came because you teach whites?

236
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,143
Why else would he be here?

237
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,577
Where they heck
did you learn that?

238
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:15,863
I'm learning it now.

239
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:18,032
But trust me...

240
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:20,125
I will get better.

241
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,607
Hey! You're going
out the back.

242
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:54,820
We got reservations, Fung.
Dig the threads.

243
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:58,038
And no joyriding.
My mom checks the mileage.

244
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,617
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

245
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,621
Can't afford this.

246
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,088
Just order some rice.

247
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,586
Yeah, but they charge
by the grain.

248
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,214
I just want to
get this message to her.

249
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:12,636
It's in English.

250
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:13,759
Yeah, she speaks English.

251
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:15,465
But she don't read English,
give me that.

252
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:16,800
Don't.
What are you doing?

253
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,431
I'm gonna write this in Chinese.

254
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:23,139
There she is.

255
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,023
Excuse me. Excuse me.

256
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:32,314
Yes, sir?

257
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,992
Do you think I could get
a clean napkin, please?

258
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:44,869
Shut up. Shut up.

259
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:48,839
Slick. Really slick.

260
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,549
That's Auntie Blossom?
She doesn't look like a gangster.

261
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:58,848
She doesn't even
look like an aunt.

262
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,553
Well, she shakes down
half the shops in Chinatown.

263
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:03,266
And that scary guy behind her...

264
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:05,473
that's Bobby Chen,
her bodyguard.

265
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,858
Nobody messes with that guy.

266
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:11,062
Do you see those
two tree stumps behind me?

267
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:12,772
Mm-hmm.

268
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:15,404
That's Wai Fu and King Lau,
they run collections for her.

269
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,902
Word is Aunt B is gonna raise
the street tax again

270
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,236
and guess what?

271
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:23,367
Bruce Lee don't pay,
Vinnie Wei don't pay either.

272
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,917
Vinnie, you're no Bruce Lee.
Come on, let's go.

273
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,078
I ain't eat nothin' yet.

274
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:29,379
I can't afford this stuff.

275
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:35,169
What's bugging you?

276
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:40,883
Wong Jack Man.

277
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,720
Just ignore him.
I can't, Frankie.

278
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,893
He may be the only person
in this world

279
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:50,275
who can tear down everything I've
been working so hard to build up.

280
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:52,816
Has he challenged you?

281
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,024
Not yet.

282
00:21:57,608 --> 00:21:58,825
So it doesn't matter then.

283
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:00,618
It does matter, Frankie.

284
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:04,248
A lot of people in Chinatown don't
like the fact that I teach whites,

285
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:05,908
that I married one.

286
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,662
And if Wong establishes
himself as a top dog here,

287
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,381
everything could change for me.

288
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:16,252
Sooner or later...

289
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:19,054
gonna have to fight him.

290
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:29,223
Xiulan.

291
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,279
You cannot do this.
They will see us.

292
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,446
I got you something.

293
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:39,279
It's an English grammar book.

294
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,321
Thank you.

295
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:57,635
I was tired this morning.

296
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:01,972
You were tired this morning.

297
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,393
He was tired this morning.

298
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:10,556
We were tired this morning.

299
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:16,270
Quan Xiulan,

300
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:20,275
do not speak to any outsiders.

301
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:24,403
Not as long as you're
under my roof.

302
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:28,741
Please, Furen,
when will my service end?

303
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:30,952
When I say that it ends.

304
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:43,964
So,

305
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:48,390
if King Lau ever sees you teaching
English to other Bi Nu again...

306
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:08,989
Hey!

307
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:10,662
Master Wong!

308
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,376
Mr. McKee.

309
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:15,204
Where you headed?

310
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:20,377
I have always wanted to see
the Golden Gate Bridge.

311
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,294
Well, hop on.

312
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,339
Really?
Yeah, come on.

313
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:26,590
Thank you.

314
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:40,070
It is truly magnificent.

315
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,397
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

316
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:43,783
The bridge is the first thing
I saw when I moved here.

317
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,742
You're not from San Francisco?

318
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,157
I'm from Indiana.

319
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,540
What wonders
do you have in Indiana?

320
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:54,244
A big car race
in Indianapolis once a year,

321
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:58,213
and corn.
Lots and lots of corn.

322
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:00,503
Do they have Kung Fu there?

323
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,501
I never heard of it
until I came here.

324
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:04,294
Really?
Mm-hmm.

325
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:07,431
Tell me about Sifu Lee.

326
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,305
He has big plans for Kung Fu.

327
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:14,020
He's making a movie,
and he wants to get into TV.

328
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:15,977
Kung Fu on television?

329
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,526
For what purpose?

330
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:23,734
To make more people aware
of the importance of Kung Fu.

331
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:25,949
Even in everyday life.

332
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:27,197
Ah...

333
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:29,870
What is the value
of Kung Fu to you?

334
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,707
The tougher you are,
the more people respect you?

335
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:36,869
Is that why you took Kung Fu,

336
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,120
to be tough?

337
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,171
Stand up for myself.

338
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,750
In northern Shaolin,

339
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,251
Kung Fu

340
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:47,964
is about self discipline
and self discovery.

341
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:49,590
For us,

342
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,559
Kung Fu does not reside
in the fists,

343
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:55,183
it resides in the soul.

344
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,733
Let me give you a lift
back into town.

345
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:04,730
No.

346
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,907
I think I will do
my Wang Shu here.

347
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:09,359
Wang Shu?

348
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,661
Sunset exercises.

349
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,702
Thank you, Mr. McKee.

350
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:18,327
Thank you.

351
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,440
McKee!

352
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:51,952
What's that supposed to be?

353
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,370
I was just warming up.

354
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:54,742
By turning yourself into a swan?

355
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:56,536
I never taught you that.

356
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,204
I just sort of picked it up.

357
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,455
From who?

358
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:02,955
Wong Jack Man.

359
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:06,507
Wong taught you that?

360
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,961
Sifu, I ran into him
and I showed him around town.

361
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,590
Well, you're such
good buddies now.

362
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:14,891
Why don't you do this?

363
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,637
You let him know I want to
see him after the tournament,

364
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:21,057
so we can talk, man to man.

365
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,141
Okay.

366
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:29,606
Master Wong.

367
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,860
Your cousin at the Jackson café
told me you were living here.

368
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,449
Come in, Mr. McKee.

369
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:37,156
Thank you.

370
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:41,919
I was just about to make tea.
Please join me.

371
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:45,960
Um...

372
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:49,297
Master Wong,
Sifu Lee wants to see you.

373
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:54,093
For what reason?

374
00:27:55,132 --> 00:27:58,102
He thinks you're here because he
teaches Kung Fu to Americans.

375
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:00,479
What do you think,
Mr. McKee?

376
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:02,522
Well, that would explain why
you don't want to teach me.

377
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:05,559
Kung Fu

378
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:07,816
is not just a way of fighting,

379
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:10,572
it is a way of living
and thinking.

380
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:13,200
It was born among
the Chinese people...

381
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,827
and it belongs to
the Chinese people.

382
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,909
What's the problem
with sharing it with us?

383
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:20,415
Do you share your
atomic bomb secrets?

384
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,208
Well, Kung Fu
isn't an atomic bomb.

385
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:23,285
No.

386
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,086
It is more powerful.

387
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:28,540
The bomb comes from
the death force.

388
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:32,219
Kung Fu comes from chi,
the life force.

389
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:35,138
Life is stronger than death.

390
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,549
Master Wong,

391
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,348
nothing about you
is what I expected.

392
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:41,679
What did you expect?

393
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:45,224
I guess, at the boat, I thought you'd
be greeted by a whole delegation.

394
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:46,399
I am a monk.

395
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:49,937
Not a television star.

396
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:51,688
Thank you.

397
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,529
But then I heard you were
working at the café.

398
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,568
Please.
Nah.

399
00:28:57,778 --> 00:28:58,779
Thank you.

400
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:02,199
You seem perturbed,
Mr. McKee.

401
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,497
Well, I'm just trying
to understand why...

402
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:06,378
Why'd you come to San Francisco?

403
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,377
I came to wash dishes.

404
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:12,209
That doesn't make any sense,
it's a terrible job.

405
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:15,838
It is honest labor
and it is necessary.

406
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:17,798
Yeah, but you're
a great Kung Fu master.

407
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:23,136
What I truly am...

408
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,230
is ashamed.

409
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:28,684
Why?

410
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:33,863
I allowed my pride
to overcome my discipline.

411
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,320
I hurt someone badly,

412
00:29:36,984 --> 00:29:38,736
someone I respected.

413
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:41,204
It is a great sin.

414
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:50,547
Now, I must do penance.

415
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:55,920
I must humble myself to restore
the balance in my soul.

416
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,388
The balance in your soul?

417
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:05,562
Tell me, what does
Sifu Lee teach you?

418
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:09,149
He teaches us to kick ass.

419
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:12,269
Kick ass?

420
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,323
To take on a student
of such a man,

421
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:25,199
that would be
a humbling experience.

422
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:26,908
Please,

423
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:29,086
let me think about it.

424
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:32,001
What should I tell Sifu Lee?

425
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:35,709
Tell him...

426
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,091
I will speak with him.

427
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,761
You see this?

428
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:49,311
You see this?
This is the karate guy...

429
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:51,233
I'm doing the exhibition with.

430
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,485
A North American champion.

431
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:55,145
Very big shot.

432
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:58,365
But I got a little surprise
in store for this guy.

433
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:00,283
The one-inch punch.

434
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:02,444
What?

435
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:19,215
By the time I'm done
with this karate cat,

436
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:22,593
all his toadae will be
standing here with you.

437
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,551
Get up!

438
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:45,204
Well, hey, Mac.
Did you see the crowd outside?

439
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:46,954
Yeah, a lot of people.

440
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,122
Well, after today,

441
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:49,575
Kung Fu is gonna be big.

442
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:52,498
Bigger than the hula hoop.
Bigger than Coca Cola.

443
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:54,580
And I'm gonna be the CEO.

444
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:56,206
I don't doubt that.

445
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,209
So,

446
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:03,756
you talked to Wong?
Yes.

447
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,054
Did he say what he's doing here?

448
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:10,645
He said he's here to restore
the balance to his soul.

449
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,897
How's he gonna do that?

450
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:17,064
By washing dishes
at the Jackson Café.

451
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:22,612
So, the great Wong Jack Man
screwed up.

452
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:26,282
That's what they do,
the old heads at the Shaolin.

453
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,368
They make you humble yourself
when you screw up.

454
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:32,200
He says he's gonna be here? Yes.

455
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:37,122
Good.

456
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:39,591
Then it starts and ends today.

457
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,551
And please welcome.

458
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:46,348
Wing Chun master, Bruce Lee!

459
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,099
Come on, Bruce Lee!

460
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:01,821
How you doing, Vince?
I'm good.

461
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:03,190
How long have
been knowing karate?

462
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:04,525
Twenty-two years.

463
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:06,201
Almost as long
as I've been alive.

464
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,704
Try not to hurt me.
All right.

465
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:14,910
Ladies and gentlemen,

466
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:19,957
this is going to be a contest
between Kung Fu and Karate.

467
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,301
Now, Vince here
is a world champion.

468
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:26,763
So, I'm gonna have to ask him
not to be so tough on me.

469
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,455
That was just a lucky shot.

470
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:55,325
I'll go a little bit
slower this time.

471
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,107
How about this, Vince?

472
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:22,819
I tell you when it's coming,

473
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,439
so you can show your boys
how to block it.

474
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:28,108
You ready?

475
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:33,446
Here it comes.

476
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:37,742
It's coming.

477
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:40,912
One...

478
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:45,004
two, three.

479
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:56,469
That's not working.

480
00:34:57,846 --> 00:34:58,938
How about this, Vince?

481
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:01,354
Now, you show me what you got.

482
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:35,975
Ladies and gentlemen,

483
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:39,346
this is the famous
Wong Jack Man,

484
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,522
master of the Shaolin temple.

485
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:45,436
He's come all the way to San
Francisco to see what I can do.

486
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:47,729
Well, Master Wong,

487
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:49,610
are you satisfied?

488
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:51,608
Yes.

489
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:53,485
Thank you.

490
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:57,947
Aren't you gonna share
some Shaolin wisdom with us?

491
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:05,914
I have seen what you can do.

492
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:09,501
I have also seen
what you cannot do.

493
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:11,386
What is that supposed to mean?

494
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:12,804
Whatever you choose it to mean.

495
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:15,678
Don't give me your Shaolin
navel-gazing, say what you mean.

496
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:19,640
Your technique is impressive.

497
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:22,522
Indeed, it is almost perfect.

498
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:26,059
But it has one limitation.

499
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:27,560
Oh, really?

500
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:31,731
What?

501
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:38,822
You.

502
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,409
You fight from ambition
and pride.

503
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:45,712
But you do not fight
from your soul.

504
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:48,878
And no matter how great
the skill you possess,

505
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,005
nothing will make up for that.

506
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,133
You want to show me
what you mean.

507
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:57,219
How do you suggest I do that?

508
00:36:58,299 --> 00:36:59,300
Fight me.

509
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:03,730
Right here and right now, so
everyone can see who has the limits.

510
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,854
No. Thank you.

511
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:09,319
That is not why I came here.

512
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:10,737
Then why did you come?

513
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,450
Because your student invited me.

514
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:18,866
And now, with your
permission, I will leave.

515
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:21,368
I told him to invite you.

516
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:24,333
I didn't think you'd
turn down a challenge

517
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:25,410
in front of all these people.

518
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:29,088
There's no need to fight.

519
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:34,010
You have made your limitation clear
in front of all these people.

520
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,884
You don't settle things
with words, Wong,

521
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,307
you settle them with your fists.

522
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:45,476
You're irrelevant, Wong.

523
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:49,730
I'm the future, you're the
past and you know it.

524
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:03,080
Why didn't you fight him?

525
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:06,915
I came here to subdue my
pride, not to indulge it.

526
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:10,376
But you can't walk away
from a public challenge.

527
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:14,130
You must know when it is necessary
to fight and when it is not.

528
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:15,210
And how...

529
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,587
how do you know
when it's necessary?

530
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,642
When you find something
so important,

531
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:25,891
you would give your life for it.

532
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:28,898
Then you must fight
to protect it.

533
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:33,520
When you have found that,

534
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:37,737
then perhaps, I would teach you.

535
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:31,919
So this is where you pray?

536
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:33,872
Yes.

537
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:39,502
For my family

538
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:41,596
and my ancestors...

539
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:45,805
that they'll all be safe.

540
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,680
Do you pray?
No.

541
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:53,100
Not even for your family?

542
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:54,559
I don't have a family.

543
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:57,103
No one?

544
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:00,114
Well, my Mom died
six months ago...

545
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:03,401
and my Dad's been
in prison for...

546
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:04,903
twelve years.

547
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:09,866
I'm sorry.

548
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:15,209
So, what do you do for fun?

549
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:18,462
You know, something for fun?

550
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,553
What would I do for fun?

551
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:26,174
Come on.

552
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:28,764
Come on. Come on,
come here.

553
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:34,270
CHILD 1; I got it.
CHILD 2; No, I got it.

554
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:36,517
I got it.

555
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,279
Okay. Yeah, good.
Then you watch the ball.

556
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:43,946
Swing through it just like this.
All right, good. Good, good.

557
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:47,699
Yep. That was good. That was good.

558
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,322
Like that?
Yeah.

559
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,745
Okay, I'm gonna toss
a couple to you, ready?

560
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,252
Okay, you ready?

561
00:40:55,328 --> 00:40:56,420
No.

562
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:57,998
Well, too bad.
Here it comes.

563
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,965
It's okay,
it's your first time ever.

564
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,182
I cannot do this.

565
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:09,759
Look, just focus.
Just watch the ball

566
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,185
all the way into the bat.

567
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,768
And keep your feet on the
ground when you swing.

568
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:17,475
Yes! Ready?

569
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:24,983
Oh, my God.

570
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:32,831
Is that better?

571
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:37,037
Um...

572
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:43,176
Yeah, it is.
It's amazing.

573
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,513
How do you do that?

574
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:50,766
This is the
pressure point for...

575
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:53,724
that area.

576
00:41:57,557 --> 00:42:00,185
When the ball hit you,
your chi...

577
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:03,938
was disturbed.

578
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:06,733
My chi?
Yes.

579
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:09,076
This brings it
back into balance.

580
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:14,539
You will feel better now.

581
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:20,497
How do you know how to do that?

582
00:42:22,415 --> 00:42:24,588
I studied Chinese medicine
at home.

583
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:29,259
I came here, hoping to
learn western medicine

584
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:31,307
at a great university.

585
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:34,969
It's my dream.

586
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,317
Wait, wait, wait!

587
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:57,909
You changed, didn't you?
Where is the money?

588
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:48,793
HOW bad?

589
00:43:50,253 --> 00:43:52,301
He's in bad shape
but they said he'll live.

590
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,090
They busted up
his Mom's business.

591
00:43:55,675 --> 00:43:56,676
Why?

592
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:59,387
Because he didn't want to pay
any boss any street tax.

593
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,933
This is Chenghu town,
that was dumb.

594
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:05,940
He did it because of you,
because you don't pay.

595
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:09,113
Well, that's different,
they don't bug me for it.

596
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:10,189
Why not?

597
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:15,452
When I was a kid in Hong Kong,
I got in fights all the time.

598
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,530
That's why my Dad
started me in Kung Fu.

599
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:21,914
When I was 16, I got in a fight
with this bad-ass kid at school.

600
00:44:22,285 --> 00:44:24,413
I beat the crap out of him,
I broke his leg.

601
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:27,756
Turns out he's the son
of a Chenghu town boss.

602
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:33,088
They tried to put a contract on me, so
my Dad had to make a deal with them.

603
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:34,926
Sent me to America.

604
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:37,883
If they leave me alone,

605
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,602
I leave them alone.

606
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:47,109
Auntie Blossom has these
girls at China Gate.

607
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:49,441
Her Bi Nus they're called.
Yeah, I know.

608
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:52,566
The triads trick 'em into coming
to America, they never let 'em go.

609
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:56,235
I met one of them.

610
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:58,830
And I don't want that happening
to her, can you help me?

611
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:02,283
You want my advice?

612
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,161
Leave her alone.

613
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:10,925
What do you think I should do?

614
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:16,260
You should speak about this
with your Sifu.

615
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:18,470
Yeah, Sifu Lee said
she's not his problem.

616
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:22,724
Master Wong, I know
this is not your fight.

617
00:45:23,888 --> 00:45:26,311
But, maybe they'll listen
to someone like you.

618
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:34,069
I'm sorry, Mr. McKee.

619
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:36,400
I told you...

620
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:38,903
I came to wash dishes.

621
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:40,238
Yeah, how long
you gonna do that?

622
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:44,033
Until they're all done.

623
00:45:45,785 --> 00:45:46,911
But they're never gonna be done.

624
00:45:48,037 --> 00:45:50,381
Precisely, like your Bi Nu.

625
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:52,966
My debt will never be repaid.

626
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:56,887
Every dirty dish
reminds me of my sin.

627
00:45:57,964 --> 00:46:01,810
But I must wash them
until my soul is clean.

628
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:07,852
You know, Sifu Lee was right,
you are irrelevant.

629
00:46:08,975 --> 00:46:11,103
You're supposed to be some great
teacher but all you care about

630
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,186
is yourself...

631
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:13,479
and penance.

632
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:26,534
Once...

633
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:28,661
in China,

634
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:34,049
there was a demonstration
match between myself...

635
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:35,960
and a Tai Chi master.

636
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:40,005
I knew I was losing...

637
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,308
in front of all the monks.

638
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:49,064
My pride overcame my discipline.

639
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:54,020
I used a very lethal kick

640
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:55,479
called the Mong Shan.

641
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:06,824
I nearly killed him.

642
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:11,295
He will never fight again.

643
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:13,752
You were just
defending yourself.

644
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,549
It was a demonstration!

645
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:18,294
Full contact was prohibited.

646
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:23,261
But I could not bear
to be humiliated.

647
00:47:25,468 --> 00:47:27,186
You were just following
your style,

648
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:28,597
using your technique.

649
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,397
Technique is a trap.

650
00:47:31,057 --> 00:47:33,401
Style is a prison.

651
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:36,274
That is what I tried to tell
Lee Jun-fan.

652
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:39,281
Kung Fu is meant to liberate.

653
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:40,779
If it's meant to liberate,

654
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,243
help me liberate Xiulan.

655
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:49,667
Are you prepared to risk
your life to help her?

656
00:47:52,912 --> 00:47:54,755
Show me your attacks.

657
00:47:56,624 --> 00:47:58,422
Right here?

658
00:47:59,168 --> 00:48:00,169
Yes.

659
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:07,218
Attack me.

660
00:48:08,344 --> 00:48:09,345
Okay.

661
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:24,160
You are expending
a great deal of energy,

662
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:25,862
I'm expending none.

663
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:28,198
Because you keep moving.

664
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,452
Because I don't want to be hit.

665
00:48:31,242 --> 00:48:33,461
NOW, I will stand Still,

666
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:36,334
you punch me in the face.

667
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:40,168
I can't.
Why not?

668
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:42,345
'Cause you're Wong Jack Man,
I won't be able to hit you.

669
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:44,046
Lesson number one:

670
00:48:45,131 --> 00:48:46,257
Know your opponent.

671
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:50,052
I promise I will not
defend myself.

672
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:51,979
Now, hit me.

673
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:56,270
No.
Why not?

674
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,647
'Cause it won't be fair.

675
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:00,904
Lesson number two:

676
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:02,777
Know yourself.

677
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:06,906
If you know yourself
and then you know your opponent,

678
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:10,789
you need not fear the outcome
of a thousand battles.

679
00:49:11,824 --> 00:49:13,622
In those two principles

680
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,912
you have the whole of Kung Fu.

681
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:19,002
And the rest is just...

682
00:49:20,249 --> 00:49:21,250
eternity.

683
00:49:30,468 --> 00:49:31,469
Steve.

684
00:49:35,723 --> 00:49:37,066
Haven't seen you in a while.

685
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:40,523
You've been training with Wong.

686
00:49:41,896 --> 00:49:42,897
Yeah.

687
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:46,700
Are you tired of my method?

688
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:52,406
Master Wong is helping me
with Xiulan.

689
00:49:53,449 --> 00:49:54,450
I'll be back.

690
00:49:55,451 --> 00:49:57,203
A man can't have
two masters, Steve.

691
00:49:58,496 --> 00:49:59,497
Good luck.

692
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:03,751
Good luck with the movie.

693
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:05,336
Yeah.

694
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:07,888
We're getting some
pretty good buzz on it.

695
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:11,467
There's even talk about me doing
Kung Fu for a new TV show,

696
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:13,010
The Green Hornet.

697
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:17,431
Master Wong thinks Kung Fu
doesn't belong on television.

698
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:19,350
Of course not.

699
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:22,565
He wants to keep it bottled up
in the monasteries in China.

700
00:50:24,313 --> 00:50:25,656
That's why he doesn't
want to fight me.

701
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:27,028
He says it isn't necessary.

702
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:28,108
Face it, Mac.

703
00:50:28,943 --> 00:50:29,990
Wong's afraid of me.

704
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:35,290
Sifu, thank you
for everything you taught me.

705
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,201
Don't mention it.

706
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:39,411
Oh, and Mac,

707
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:41,747
tell Wong...

708
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:44,174
if he ever works up the courage

709
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:47,379
I'll take him
on anywhere, anytime.

710
00:51:08,983 --> 00:51:10,906
I told him to Kung Fu no more.

711
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:12,907
Send him back to school.

712
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:14,738
He accountant.

713
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:17,241
Do something useful
for a change.

714
00:51:34,717 --> 00:51:38,221
I believe you are friend
of Wong Jack Man.

715
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:46,645
Mr. McKee.

716
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:48,981
What is it?

717
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:52,569
Auntie Blossom said
if you fight Sifu Lee

718
00:51:53,277 --> 00:51:54,779
she'll release Xiulan Quan.

719
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:01,709
I wish I could help.

720
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:03,037
Xuilan's being held prisoner.

721
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:07,125
Look, I know you came here
to do your penance.

722
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:10,674
But she's being punished and she
hasn't done anything wrong.

723
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:14,382
You said you didn't want to be
baited into a fight with no purpose,

724
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:17,435
now you have the power to free
a completely innocent person.

725
00:52:19,011 --> 00:52:21,184
Isn't that more important
than washing dishes?

726
00:52:25,768 --> 00:52:29,238
This is not karate, ladies.
This is Kung Fu.

727
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:33,985
You're not training for the Olympics,
you're training for the street.

728
00:52:35,027 --> 00:52:38,622
So what are you gonna do when a
bad-ass comes at you in an alley?

729
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:41,125
Kick ass. Kick ass.

730
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:51,126
Master Wong.

731
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:56,807
So what do you do when a bad ass
comes at you in an alley?

732
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,477
You must ask yourself...

733
00:53:01,387 --> 00:53:02,684
why is he doing that.

734
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:05,645
He's fighting against the world.

735
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:07,688
He's on the wrong path.

736
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:09,978
But what you do?

737
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:12,781
The role of a Sifu

738
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:15,739
is to bring him into harmony
with the world...

739
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:18,112
and with himself.

740
00:53:18,696 --> 00:53:20,164
Suppose he's trying to kill you.

741
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:22,787
Then I suppose...

742
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:24,914
you kick his ass.

743
00:53:25,494 --> 00:53:30,091
But having done that, you offer him
the possibility of enlightenment.

744
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:32,167
If he refuses?

745
00:53:32,835 --> 00:53:34,178
You have failed him.

746
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:36,089
And yourself.

747
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:38,928
Have you come to offer me
enlightenment?

748
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:44,972
I have come...

749
00:53:45,806 --> 00:53:47,274
to accept your challenge.

750
00:54:38,567 --> 00:54:40,490
I have been given permission
to speak with you.

751
00:54:40,569 --> 00:54:42,287
Auntie Blossom
is gonna let you go.

752
00:54:43,322 --> 00:54:44,323
Why?

753
00:54:45,157 --> 00:54:46,704
I gave her something she wanted.

754
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:50,750
But what about the other girls?

755
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:52,748
They're like my sisters now.

756
00:55:07,513 --> 00:55:09,356
Oh, hey, Mac.
Come on in.

757
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:18,358
I figure you're training
with Wong full time.

758
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:20,859
I am.

759
00:55:20,943 --> 00:55:23,537
Well, a teacher
doesn't give you the truth,

760
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:26,449
he only points you to a truth that
you have to find out for yourself.

761
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:30,077
If I pointed you to Wong
Jack Man, that's okay.

762
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:32,667
Is he ready for the fight?

763
00:55:33,205 --> 00:55:34,206
I think so.

764
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:36,174
Well, he better be.

765
00:55:36,792 --> 00:55:39,762
Chinatown made me the heavy favorite,
they're like Wong in Hong Kong, but

766
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:41,338
he sets even money.

767
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:44,178
You gonna bet on the fight?

768
00:55:44,258 --> 00:55:45,384
I don't know yet.

769
00:55:45,801 --> 00:55:47,769
Wong's a saint, I'm the street.

770
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:49,558
Never bet against the street.

771
00:55:50,514 --> 00:55:53,688
Master Wong wanted me to speak to
you about the terms of the fight.

772
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:01,404
You're his second now?

773
00:56:03,235 --> 00:56:04,236
Yeah.

774
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:05,779
What does he want?

775
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:09,537
No kicks to the face
or groin, no eye-jabs.

776
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:11,330
Does he want to play
a Strauss Waltz, too?

777
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:13,708
In return he agrees
not to use his kicks.

778
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:20,502
I finally get it.

779
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:23,263
He must've used his Mon Shan on
some old head at the Shaolin.

780
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:24,464
No, not at the Shaolin.

781
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:26,801
At a demonstration
against a Tai Chi master.

782
00:56:27,259 --> 00:56:28,260
Did he kill him?

783
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:30,762
Almost.

784
00:56:31,263 --> 00:56:33,516
That'll get you washing dishes
at the Jackson Café.

785
00:56:36,685 --> 00:56:37,686
You tell Wong this...

786
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:39,818
no rules, no holds barred.

787
00:56:39,897 --> 00:56:41,615
No limits, you guys'd
kill each other.

788
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:43,283
Then he'll have to concede
before that.

789
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:45,907
You know, I was thinking

790
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:50,449
San Francisco Civic. Sell tickets,
pack the house, press, TV...

791
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:52,125
You said anywhere, anytime.

792
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:56,079
Where does he want to fight?

793
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:59,758
He's been training at a warehouse down
by the docks, he wants it up there.

794
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:04,839
Maybe I'll open a noodle stand,
make a few bucks on the side.

795
00:57:04,922 --> 00:57:06,424
No more than a dozen witnesses.

796
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:13,555
Fair enough.

797
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:16,099
We'll do it his way.

798
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:17,934
But you let him know...

799
00:57:18,644 --> 00:57:20,646
I want the results published
for the whole world to see.

800
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:37,746
We're so pleased how you
set this all up, Marge.

801
00:57:38,747 --> 00:57:39,964
A promise is a promise.

802
00:57:40,499 --> 00:57:41,921
How about a drink for my Dad?

803
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:43,672
Of course, please.

804
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:47,632
The handle in Hong Kong
just cracked 12 million.

805
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:49,383
You did a good job, Margie.

806
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:51,468
Thank you.
What would you like?

807
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:08,823
I am far from Shaolin...

808
00:58:09,695 --> 00:58:11,368
except for that word.

809
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:16,994
Fight's tomorrow, Master Wong.
You should get some sleep.

810
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:21,923
Whatever happens,

811
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:24,209
your Xiulan will be free.

812
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,388
She doesn't want to leave
unless the other Bi Nu

813
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:29,464
are freed as well.

814
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:33,385
She's a very noble person.

815
00:58:34,094 --> 00:58:35,186
You have chosen well.

816
00:58:37,723 --> 00:58:39,396
But I must tell you,
Mr. McKee,

817
00:58:40,684 --> 00:58:42,186
lam not fighting for her,

818
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:44,229
or for you,

819
00:58:45,022 --> 00:58:46,274
or for myself,

820
00:58:47,983 --> 00:58:49,781
Lee Jun-fan was correct.

821
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:52,074
He is the future.

822
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,282
He will bring Kung Fu
to the world.

823
00:58:56,283 --> 00:58:57,580
I can see that now.

824
00:58:58,827 --> 00:59:01,751
He has talent.
Great talent.

825
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:03,836
And ambition.

826
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:08,299
But what sort of Kung Fu
will he bring to the world,

827
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:12,633
an angry thing?
A hurtful thing?

828
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:14,726
A thing to be bought...

829
00:59:15,177 --> 00:59:16,178
and sold?

830
00:59:17,471 --> 00:59:18,814
Unless...

831
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:21,641
Unless what?

832
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:24,690
Unless...

833
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:28,815
he's willing to be reborn.

834
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,001
You worried?

835
00:59:48,877 --> 00:59:50,800
About tomorrow?
Aren't you?

836
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:55,934
Bruce, just protect yourself.

837
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:57,552
Seriously.

838
00:59:58,929 --> 01:00:00,772
Wong's the one who
better protect himself.

839
01:00:25,956 --> 01:00:27,708
I heard you nearly
killed Wang Biao.

840
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:33,964
You think you can kill me?

841
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:37,934
I have no desire to do so.

842
01:00:43,223 --> 01:00:44,691
Then you just killed yourself.

843
01:02:16,441 --> 01:02:17,909
Why don't you stand and fight?

844
01:02:19,236 --> 01:02:21,580
Because that is what
you want me to do.

845
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:29,165
These stairs go nowhere.

846
01:04:31,326 --> 01:04:32,543
Like your style.

847
01:04:40,919 --> 01:04:42,045
You've reached the end.

848
01:04:43,671 --> 01:04:44,968
So have you.

849
01:05:26,631 --> 01:05:29,851
Now you begin
to exceed your limits.

850
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:38,184
What limits?

851
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:34,532
It's over.

852
01:06:36,034 --> 01:06:37,251
Not unless you kill me.

853
01:08:39,324 --> 01:08:40,325
Who won?

854
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:43,878
Which of you won?

855
01:09:00,053 --> 01:09:03,728
MAN". We're holding $ 15,000,000
in bets and we cannot pay off.

856
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:07,230
You force one of them
to admit he lost.

857
01:09:07,602 --> 01:09:08,854
You got 24 hours.

858
01:09:21,616 --> 01:09:23,038
At least your face is okay.

859
01:09:23,242 --> 01:09:24,835
We can still get you on TV.

860
01:09:28,498 --> 01:09:29,499
It took too long.

861
01:09:32,085 --> 01:09:33,086
But you beat him.

862
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:37,674
When he had me in a headlock...

863
01:09:39,342 --> 01:09:40,434
he could've killed me.

864
01:09:41,344 --> 01:09:42,345
What'd he say to you?

865
01:09:46,891 --> 01:09:47,892
"Do you understand?"

866
01:09:49,644 --> 01:09:50,645
Understand what?

867
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:41,821
Your soul belongs to others.

868
01:10:44,323 --> 01:10:45,950
You better hope I get my winner.

869
01:10:48,119 --> 01:10:50,918
Or your body
will belong to others.

870
01:11:10,183 --> 01:11:11,184
There's no winner.

871
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:14,020
I know. I'll find the money
to help Xiulan buy her way out.

872
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:16,355
Too late.
There's more at stake now.

873
01:11:17,231 --> 01:11:19,233
If you don't get me a winner
by midnight tonight...

874
01:11:19,984 --> 01:11:21,782
Quan Xiulan will be sold
to one of the houses.

875
01:11:45,259 --> 01:11:46,260
Mr. McKee.

876
01:11:47,929 --> 01:11:48,930
I'm sorry...

877
01:11:49,931 --> 01:11:51,649
if I have caused you trouble.

878
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:55,103
It seems I have caused
a great deal of trouble.

879
01:11:56,437 --> 01:11:59,031
I came here in a spirit
of humility...

880
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:02,193
in an effort to disappear.

881
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:04,821
And now...

882
01:12:05,446 --> 01:12:07,323
could I have failed
more completely?

883
01:12:07,406 --> 01:12:08,578
You won that fight.

884
01:12:08,658 --> 01:12:10,080
It is not that simple.

885
01:12:11,077 --> 01:12:13,421
My intentions
was to teach Lee Jun-fan

886
01:12:13,538 --> 01:12:15,506
that his attitude is irreverent

887
01:12:15,665 --> 01:12:17,963
and his style is inadequate.

888
01:12:19,794 --> 01:12:23,344
If, in defeating him, I drive
him further in that direction,

889
01:12:23,881 --> 01:12:25,098
then I have lost.

890
01:12:25,842 --> 01:12:28,812
If, in losing to him,
I change his direction,

891
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:30,471
then I have won.

892
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:33,141
Do you understand?

893
01:12:33,224 --> 01:12:34,567
We're not in a monastery
in China.

894
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:36,443
This is America.

895
01:12:36,853 --> 01:12:38,400
And in America
we have winners and losers,

896
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:40,982
and right now we need
a winner and a loser.

897
01:12:41,148 --> 01:12:43,196
Life is not always that easy.

898
01:12:43,317 --> 01:12:44,990
You know whose life
is not gonna be easy?

899
01:12:45,444 --> 01:12:50,166
Xiulan. Let me declare
that you won, please.

900
01:12:51,784 --> 01:12:53,411
It would make no difference.

901
01:12:53,786 --> 01:12:55,754
Bruce Lee
will never accept that.

902
01:12:55,872 --> 01:12:57,169
Then will you say that you lost?

903
01:12:57,248 --> 01:12:58,500
I cannot.

904
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,468
Not until I know I have won.

905
01:13:00,543 --> 01:13:02,011
What about Xiulan?

906
01:13:04,463 --> 01:13:07,216
That is a matter
for you to decide.

907
01:13:10,970 --> 01:13:14,190
Mac, I'm sorry, I just... I don't
think there's anything you can do.

908
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:22,194
I'm gonna go down there
and get her out myself.

909
01:13:22,857 --> 01:13:25,155
Just right before lunch, she'll
be setting up the dining room...

910
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:26,656
What happens if those triads
guys see you first?

911
01:13:26,777 --> 01:13:28,779
- Well, do you have any idea...
- Yeah, wait a few days, I...

912
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:30,703
She's not gonna be there
in a few days. Steve!

913
01:13:30,948 --> 01:13:32,325
Steve!
What?

914
01:13:34,702 --> 01:13:35,999
You're gonna
get yourself killed.

915
01:14:15,201 --> 01:14:16,669
I thought you were a dishwasher.

916
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:22,291
I was promoted.

917
01:14:27,088 --> 01:14:28,089
Why are we at war?

918
01:14:30,049 --> 01:14:31,141
You are at war.

919
01:14:32,093 --> 01:14:33,094
I am not.

920
01:14:34,845 --> 01:14:36,813
Certainly seemed like
we were yesterday.

921
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:42,561
How may I help you?

922
01:14:44,814 --> 01:14:47,363
I just got a call from one
of my students, Vinnie Wei,

923
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:48,697
Steve McKee's friend.

924
01:14:50,236 --> 01:14:53,365
McKee's over at the China Gate, taking
on the Chenghu town by himself.

925
01:14:54,198 --> 01:14:55,199
Over a girl.

926
01:14:56,826 --> 01:14:57,793
He'll get killed.

927
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:04,425
Then, he has found something
he's willing to die for.

928
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:07,169
Wong Sifu,

929
01:15:08,963 --> 01:15:10,510
whatever went down between us...

930
01:15:11,882 --> 01:15:14,351
he's your toadae
and he's my toadae.

931
01:15:15,302 --> 01:15:16,519
He's our responsibility.

932
01:15:18,222 --> 01:15:19,223
Meaning what?

933
01:15:20,725 --> 01:15:22,227
Meaning we shouldn't be
just standing here.

934
01:15:24,145 --> 01:15:25,146
But you said...

935
01:15:26,564 --> 01:15:28,282
it is not your problem.

936
01:15:30,609 --> 01:15:31,610
What has changed?

937
01:15:38,325 --> 01:15:39,326
Everything.

938
01:15:55,676 --> 01:15:57,098
Hey, who won the fight?

939
01:15:57,970 --> 01:15:59,096
Got an answer, asshole?

940
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:00,352
Yeah, I got an answer.

941
01:17:11,961 --> 01:17:13,679
You're great advertisement
for our training.

942
01:17:14,338 --> 01:17:15,464
I'm fine.

943
01:17:18,759 --> 01:17:19,760
Please...

944
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:21,303
just stay here.

945
01:17:24,932 --> 01:17:26,525
No, no, no.
No more trouble.

946
01:17:38,445 --> 01:17:39,412
Beat it.

947
01:17:41,532 --> 01:17:42,954
What do you say, Master Wong?

948
01:17:44,368 --> 01:17:45,369
Shall we beat it?

949
01:20:26,864 --> 01:20:28,491
Now we settle
unfinished business.

950
01:20:29,283 --> 01:20:30,284
I'll make it quick.

951
01:22:00,624 --> 01:22:02,217
Did I ever show you
my one-inch punch, Tony?

952
01:22:12,136 --> 01:22:13,137
One-inch punch?

953
01:22:14,972 --> 01:22:16,315
You must teach me that one.

954
01:22:58,348 --> 01:22:59,349
Hey!

955
01:23:02,603 --> 01:23:04,651
This is a scene you don't see
in the chopsocky.

956
01:23:05,105 --> 01:23:07,199
The one where the Kung Fu cats
get their heads blown off.

957
01:23:07,274 --> 01:23:08,275
Ah!

958
01:23:12,154 --> 01:23:13,155
Hey guys.

959
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:25,463
You really need an elevator
in this dump.

960
01:23:26,585 --> 01:23:27,552
Where's Xiulan?

961
01:23:28,754 --> 01:23:29,755
She's not here.

962
01:23:30,339 --> 01:23:33,013
Do you think I would leave my
trump card lying on the table?

963
01:23:33,592 --> 01:23:36,345
You want the girl,
I want a decision.

964
01:23:36,428 --> 01:23:37,429
Now, who won?

965
01:23:39,932 --> 01:23:40,933
If we answer...

966
01:23:41,934 --> 01:23:43,686
you will set Quan Xiulan free?

967
01:23:43,977 --> 01:23:45,775
That was the arrangement.

968
01:23:49,983 --> 01:23:51,781
Then I admit that I lost.

969
01:23:53,070 --> 01:23:54,663
Lee Jun-fan
is the winner.

970
01:23:55,948 --> 01:23:57,120
Do you accept that?

971
01:23:58,909 --> 01:23:59,910
No.

972
01:23:59,993 --> 01:24:01,540
Are you kidding me?

973
01:24:05,832 --> 01:24:07,084
You release all the girls.

974
01:24:08,001 --> 01:24:09,719
No more Bi Nu in Chinatown.

975
01:24:15,008 --> 01:24:16,385
All right. Deal.

976
01:24:17,386 --> 01:24:20,310
Sonny, put the word out
that Bruce Lee is the winner.

977
01:24:21,515 --> 01:24:22,983
And release the girls.

978
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:33,652
Do you remember me, asshole?

979
01:24:34,528 --> 01:24:36,121
I remember breaking your leg.

980
01:24:36,863 --> 01:24:37,864
So do I.

981
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:48,667
Was that the Mon Shan?

982
01:24:49,918 --> 01:24:51,670
I don't know, you tell me.

983
01:25:07,561 --> 01:25:08,653
Vinnie.

984
01:25:08,729 --> 01:25:09,776
Hey, I got these for you.

985
01:25:09,855 --> 01:25:11,027
You steal 'em from next door?

986
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:12,278
Two doors down.

987
01:25:13,609 --> 01:25:14,986
What are you so happy about?

988
01:25:15,068 --> 01:25:17,412
Well, I bet a thousand bucks
on Sifu and I cleaned up.

989
01:25:17,904 --> 01:25:18,905
Who'd you bet on?

990
01:25:19,573 --> 01:25:21,325
Master Wong.

991
01:25:21,491 --> 01:25:23,994
I told you, never bet
against the street.

992
01:25:24,077 --> 01:25:25,124
Sifu.

993
01:25:25,912 --> 01:25:26,913
Take it easy, Mac.

994
01:25:27,205 --> 01:25:28,627
I can imagine how you feel.

995
01:25:30,459 --> 01:25:33,178
Actually I can't, I never
had my ass kicked before.

996
01:25:33,879 --> 01:25:35,426
What is it like?
It hurts.

997
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:37,511
But all the girls were let go.

998
01:25:38,425 --> 01:25:39,972
Thank you, both of you.

999
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:43,267
Hey, I took a grand off of my
Mom's bank account to bet on you,

1000
01:25:43,347 --> 01:25:45,600
and I better put it back
before she finds out.

1001
01:25:47,726 --> 01:25:48,727
Glad you're not dead.

1002
01:25:54,608 --> 01:25:55,655
Do you need anything?

1003
01:25:57,277 --> 01:25:58,278
No, I'm good.

1004
01:26:00,697 --> 01:26:02,665
But I do have to ask.

1005
01:26:04,576 --> 01:26:06,453
Do you really think
you won that fight?

1006
01:26:10,707 --> 01:26:11,708
Yes.

1007
01:26:13,251 --> 01:26:14,252
Why?

1008
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:19,341
Wong showed me...

1009
01:26:19,925 --> 01:26:21,552
I had reached
a limit of my style.

1010
01:26:22,678 --> 01:26:23,975
I was only fighting myself.

1011
01:26:24,846 --> 01:26:27,315
He made me realize I had to
create a whole new style.

1012
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:29,601
You know how water

1013
01:26:30,143 --> 01:26:31,816
takes the shape of anything
you put it in,

1014
01:26:32,187 --> 01:26:33,985
but it stays strong and pure?

1015
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:36,567
Now that's gonna be my style.

1016
01:26:38,068 --> 01:26:39,069
Cool.

1017
01:26:40,529 --> 01:26:42,156
I was planning on being a star,

1018
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:44,950
but I think I'd rather be
a legend instead.

1019
01:26:47,577 --> 01:26:48,578
Like Wong Jack Man.

1020
01:26:52,791 --> 01:26:54,259
Will you be back, Master Wong?

1021
01:26:55,502 --> 01:26:57,300
Yes, I think so.

1022
01:26:58,588 --> 01:27:00,010
There's much to learn here

1023
01:27:00,507 --> 01:27:02,225
and perhaps some to teach.

1024
01:27:03,468 --> 01:27:05,061
Will you still be here
when I return?

1025
01:27:05,512 --> 01:27:06,513
Maybe.

1026
01:27:07,472 --> 01:27:09,065
I guess we'll have
to see how things go.

1027
01:27:11,184 --> 01:27:12,185
Mr. McKee...

1028
01:27:13,729 --> 01:27:14,730
thank you.

1029
01:27:15,731 --> 01:27:16,732
Without you,

1030
01:27:17,399 --> 01:27:19,993
I think I may never have
finished washing dishes.

1031
01:27:22,237 --> 01:27:25,207
Master Wong, Sifu Lee understood
what you wanted to teach him.

1032
01:27:25,699 --> 01:27:26,916
So you did win that fight.

1033
01:27:30,162 --> 01:27:32,335
Kung Fu must be given
to the world.

1034
01:27:33,248 --> 01:27:34,591
Bruce Lee will do that.

1035
01:27:35,751 --> 01:27:36,968
And if he does not...

1036
01:27:37,794 --> 01:27:41,844
I may have to come back
and kick his ass again.
