Excuse me! Dragon on the move!

19
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,784
Important Princess Documents
coming through!

20
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:08,585
Wow! Everypony from Manehattan
to Saddle Arabia is here!

21
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,754
I know, filly.
We almost couldn't book a stable!

22
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,418
Princess Twilight must have
her hooves full with this giant festival!

23
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:17,923
Are you kidding?

24
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:20,130
She's smart and organized
and cool under pressure.

25
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:22,180
There's nothing she can't handle!

26
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,856
My goodness! I can't handle this!

27
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:37,484
Nothing is working!

28
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,653
I just have to get it together.

29
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:42,201
Just go in there. And ask!

30
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:44,825
This is your Friendship Festival.

31
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:48,200
Every pony's happiness
rests in your hooves.

32
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,289
Okay, Twilight.

33
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,131
Got all your charts and graphs!

34
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:57,754
Oh, thank goodness
you're here, Spike.

35
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,961
I'm just so nervous about this meeting.

36
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:01,387
What you talkin' about?

37
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:06,096
I'm about to ask the three
most royal princesses

38
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,678
of Equestria for a huge favor.

39
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,805
What if they reject me?

40
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:14,768
It'll be fine!
Just remember the most important thing.

41
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,481
Smile?

42
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,189
Uh, no.

43
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,324
You're a princess, too!

44
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:24,656
Right.

45
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:37,714
Good morning, Princesses!

46
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:39,588
Thank you all for seeing me.

47
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:42,386
I have an idea that I think will make
our Friendship Festival

48
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,931
the most wonderful celebration
Equestria has ever seen.

49
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:48,805
Yes, Twilight, we are very excited.

50
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,888
Ponies have been arriving
from all over all morning.

51
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:53,223
I'd like to think it's to see us

52
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:56,525
but Songbird Serenade might
be the bigger attraction.

53
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:59,228
Yes, she is the "mane" event.

54
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:03,066
And to make it extra special,
I could use your help. Spike?

55
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,575
Songbird Serenade's performance
is not scheduled

56
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:11,078
to start until after you begin the sunset.

57
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:13,876
And based on my precise calculation

58
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,919
to get the very best lighting
for the stage,

59
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,167
Princess Celestia,

60
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,748
I was hoping you could make sure

61
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:21,459
the sun stays about 28.1 degrees
to the south.

62
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:22,839
And Princess Luna,

63
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,886
if you could raise the moon 62 degrees

64
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,965
to the north at the same time,

65
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,220
it would reflect the sunlight
on the other side

66
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:32,770
and really frame
the entire stage perfectly!

67
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,314
- I...
- But wait, there's more!

68
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,733
Cadance, if you could use
your crystal magic

69
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,651
to create an aurora above the stage

70
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,775
the sun and the moon
will shine through it

71
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,697
and create a truly amazing light show!

72
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:48,077
Presenting Songbird Serenade!

73
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:49,495
<i>♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah ♪</i>

74
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:50,947
Whoa. Whoa!

75
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,119
Tada!

76
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:58,830
So, you're saying you want
us to move the sun

77
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:01,416
and the moon for the party?

78
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,297
Well, I'd do it myself except

79
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,843
I don't have your magic.

80
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:05,966
Twilight...

81
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:07,843
Each of us uses our powers

82
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:10,050
to serve Equestria in our own way.

83
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,219
You are the Princess of Friendship.

84
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,894
You already have all the magic you need.

85
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:21,106
So that'd be a no?

86
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:22,986
Yes!

87
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:29,444
Skies cleared and ready for the festival!

88
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:54,060
Heads up, Fluttershy!
Out of control balloon!

89
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:59,019
I don't think it's the balloon
that's out of control, Pinkie Pie.

90
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,767
Hey, y'all!

91
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,524
Anypony up for some free samples

92
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,400
of my family's apple cider?

93
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,776
Ah!

94
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,654
Thank you. Loved it.

95
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,244
Wow, Rarity, that's a fine job
you're doing there.

96
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,497
'Course it might not get done
till after the concert.

97
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:26,301
Applejack, darling, anypony can do fine.

98
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,754
Twilight asked me.
So clearly, she's going for fabulous.

99
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:31,840
And fabulous takes time.

100
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:35,552
Fabulous takes forever. But awesome...

101
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,145
Whoa!

102
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,136
Can get done in four seconds flat.

103
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,649
Faster if I do my Sonic Rainboom.

104
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:49,153
No, no, no, no!
Don't you dare, Rainbow Dash!

105
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,027
It looks wretched enough already.

106
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,112
Oh, come on, it's fine.

107
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,447
If you were raised in a barn!

108
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,828
No offense, Applejack.

109
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:02,708
None taken. 'Specially since
I wasn't raised in a barn.

110
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:05,005
My family just happens to have a barn,

111
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,457
where I was born.

112
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:09,385
And spent most of my formative years.

113
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:10,712
Raised in a barn!

114
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:13,889
Okay, just 218 things left
to do, and we're ready.

115
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,557
Hey, Twilight.

116
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:16,851
Hello, Spike.

117
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,645
Uh, hi, Rarity.

118
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,980
How'd it go with the other princesses?

119
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,274
They like your idea?

120
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,317
I bet they loved it!

121
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,235
Not exactly.

122
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:30,281
They think I can make today
perfect without their magic.

123
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,950
And they are absolutely right, darling.

124
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:35,028
This festival is your brilliant idea,

125
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,329
and we know you're up to the task.

126
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:38,405
But what if I'm not?

127
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,833
What if Songbird Serenade hates the stage?

128
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,581
Or nopony makes a new friend?

129
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:44,958
And if I fail at the festival,
then who am I?

130
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,914
Twilight, look at me.

131
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:50,752
This will be the biggest celebration
Equestria has ever seen!

132
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:53,178
As the Princess of Friendship,
you cannot fail!

133
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:55,301
This day will define who you are!

134
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:57,224
The pressure is intense!

135
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,597
It's almost too much
for any single pony to handle!

136
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,936
But you have us! So stop worrying.

Oopsie!

00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:56,417
Guess my easy bake confetti cake cannon

200
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,294
needs a little bit more finetuning.

Songbird Serenade!

202

00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:05,843
It is, it is!

204
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,804
Hiya! I'm looking for
the pony in charge.

205
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:14,936
I need to set up for my sound check.

206
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:16,562
Ms. Songbird Serenade?

207
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:18,940
Um, I was just going to check on you.

208
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,864
I'm Princess Twilight.
And sorry about the mess.

209
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,067
I'm usually not so...

210
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:26,614
Oh! How embarrassing!

211
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:29,117
Caked in cake?

212
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,748
You have visual on buttercream?

213
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,496
Visual confirmed. Go for cleanup.

214
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:48,390
Storm clouds?

215
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:51,969
I ordered perfect weather! Rainbow Dash!

216
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:53,144
Uh...

217
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:56,190
I don't think those are storm clouds.

218
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:16,411
Ooh. I bet those
are the clowns I ordered!

219
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:31,308
You are definitely
not the clowns I ordered.

220
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,732
Brian, no!

221
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,378
<i>Ponies of Equestria!</i>

222
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:06,552
<i>We come on behalf of the fearsome,</i>

223
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:10,472
<i>the powerful, the almighty,</i>

224
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:13,850
<i>Storm King!</i>

225
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:16,353
This is terrible.

226
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,018
<i>And now,</i>

227
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,980
<i>to deliver the evil, evil message,</i>

228
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:30,785
<i>put your hooves together
for Commander Tempest!</i>

229
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:40,245
Is that a unicorn?

230
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:43,126
I think so,
but what happened to her horn?

231
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,633
Tempest, is it?

232
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,336
How may we help you?

233
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,055
Ah, I'm so glad you asked.

234
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:56,055
How about we start with your complete
and total surrender?

235
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,266
What? What?

236
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,231
Hi, there, Princess of Friendship.

237
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,149
Not exactly sure what's going on,

238
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,228
but I know we can talk things out.

239
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:08,940
Oh, goodie. All four princesses.

240
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,484
Here's the deal, ladies.
I need your magic.

241
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:16,572
Give it up nicely, please,
or we make it difficult.

242
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,248
For everyone.

243
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,826
And why should we cower before you?

244
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,754
There's one of you, and hundreds of us.

245
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,215
I was hoping

246
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,793
you'd choose difficult.

247
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:58,455
- Cadance!
- Argh! I can't stop it!

248
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:03,247
Luna, quick! Go south!
Beyond the badlands!

249
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,877
Seek help from the Queen of the Hippo--

250
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:21,641
Luna!

251
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:28,818
Twilight!

252
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,574
Easy as pie.

253
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,741
Oh, I love pie.

254
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,954
Oh, you totally got the last princess.

255
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,784
That's not the Princess.

256
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:47,375
Grubber! Get her now!

257
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:49,172
Guys, we gotta get the Princess!

258
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,295
Over here, y'all!

259
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:52,839
Come on!

260
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,218
Which one of you guys
are going down there?

261
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:39,507
I would, but I just had a hearty meal

262
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,183
and I will sink and I will side cramp.

263
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:45,058
I'm very big-boned. I sink quick.

264
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:15,884
Everypony okay?

265
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,799
I think my bottom's on backward.

266
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,471
We just got our cupcakes handed to us

267
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:22,766
by the worst party crasher ever!

268
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:24,559
We gotta go back there and fight!

269
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,477
You saw the size of those goons!

270
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,763
Do you seriously wanna go back?

271
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:31,441
So, now what?
We can't hide here forever

272
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:34,565
and let's be honest, we can't go back.

273
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,612
Look at what they did to the princesses.

274
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:38,611
We've got to keep them from Twilight.

275
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:41,076
The Queen...

276
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:44,579
Yeah, the Queen!

277
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,782
Uh, what queen?

278
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:51,462
Celestia told Luna to find
the Queen of the Hippos.

279
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,957
Luna can't, so I have to.

280
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:57,585
Uh, hippos? Seriously?

281
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:00,170
I've heard they're surprisingly graceful
for their size.

282
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:01,675
But they're always hungry.

283
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,594
- Hungry?
- Hippos?

284
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:09,062
They're somewhere south,
past the badlands.

285
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:13,392
But that means we'll have
to leave Equestria. Ooh!

286
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:14,977
I'm not even packed!

287
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:18,564
I understand you're scared,
and nopony else has to go.

288
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:23,243
But I have to find this queen.
She might be our only hope.

289
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:32,752
Well, you're not getting all the glory.

290
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,079
We're in this together.

291
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,674
- We got yer back!
- Indeedy!

292
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,298
I am ready to save Equestria!

293
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:41,802
Yay.

294
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,471
We're all behind you, Twilight.

295
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:45,299
Let's go find this hippo!

296
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,433
Uh, south?

297
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:53,940
Boingy, boingy, boingy, boingy, boingy.

298
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:57,394
Anypony up for a game of "I Spy?"

299
00:19:57,488 --> 00:19:59,070
No really, come on!

300
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:03,116
I spy with my little eye
something that is orange.

301
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:08,072
No takers? It's you, Applejack!

302
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,350
All this power, wasted on parties.

303
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:34,143
When there are far greater uses.

304
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:42,485
Well, answer it!

305
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:51,077
<i>Where am I supposed to be looking?</i>

306
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:53,871
<i>I never understand how this spell works.</i>

307
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:54,997
<i>Tempest!</i>

308
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,794
Over here, Your Excellency.

309
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:59,168
<i>- Where? Huh?</i>
- Over here. No.

310
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,170
No, right. Look right.

311
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,717
<i>- My right?</i>
- Yep.

312
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:04,469
<i>Oh, there you are.</i>

313
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:06,717
<i>Here's the deal. I'm in the
middle of a big rebrand here.</i>

314
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,673
<i>"The Storm King" is tracking well,</i>

315
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,555
<i>as "intensely intimidating."</i>

316
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,260
<i>But you know what? I need to back it up.</i>

317
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,595
<i>You know what I need to back it up with?</i>

318
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,521
<i>A storm! That would be great!</i>

319
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:19,063
<i>You promised me magic that
could control the elements</i>

320
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:20,860
<i>and right now, I'm holding a what?</i>

321
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,063
<i>A branch, a twig. Blegh.</i>

322
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:25,490
Uh, that would be The Staff of Sacanas,
Your Excellency

323
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:27,693
- and it will channel the magic--
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

324
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,744
...of the four rulers of this land.

325
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,618
You'll soon have the power
of 100 armies.

326
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,416
<i>So, that would be a "yes"
on you locking down</i>

327
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:38,712
<i>the four pegacornicuses
or whatever you call them?</i>

328
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:39,959
Give me three days.

329
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:42,336
I'll have everything ready
for your arrival.

330
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:47,262
<i>Remember, Tempest, only I have
the power to make you whole.</i>

331
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:50,716
<i>Make this twig work,
and you'll get your reward.</i>

332
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,267
<i>Fail me,</i>

333
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:55,812
<i>and your horn won't be
the only thing that's broken.</i>

334
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:57,806
It won't be a problem.

335
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:00,274
<i>Great!</i>

336
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:02,774
<i>I'm ready to power up, crash and bash,</i>

337
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:06,322
<i>and be the biggest, baddest bugaloo!</i>

338
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:12,325
Sorry. Bad spell service.
You want me to call him back?

339
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,950
Do you have the Princess?

340
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,040
Well, uh, funny story.

341
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,584
It kind of seems like she...

342
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,087
She might have, like,
you know, gotten away.

343
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:22,793
A little bit.

344
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:27,423
I know you're disappointed,
but I got one word for you.

345
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:29,421
Spongecake.

346
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:35,139
I need all four for the staff to work.

347
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:36,595
Hey, I know.

348
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:39,853
I want the Storm King to fix
that crazy horn as badly as you do.

349
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:43,276
It looks like a crackly, chipped tooth
on the top of your head

350
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,135
and you know you don't look
good in hats.

351
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,690
That princess is not gonna keep me

352
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,741
from getting my horn back.

353
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:53,036
Prepare my ship!

354
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:58,325
Please. How far can one little
pony get on her own?

355
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:22,600
Guys, sand's in my everything.

356
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:27,604
Saving Equestria.

357
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,028
Oh, look! Maybe this guy knows
which way to go!

358
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:37,990
What's that, friend? We're lost?

359
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:52,846
We could be going in circles.

360
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,507
Endless sand.

361
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:59,348
Nothing for miles but sand...

362
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:02,181
And this rock...

363
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,140
And this cactus...

364
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,768
And this road.

365
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:11,906
This road.

366
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:14,651
- Hmm?
- A road?

367
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:18,572
Where there's a road, there's a...

368
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,454
Whoa!

369
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:23,455
Cool!

370
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,628
What is that?

371
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:31,175
Ooh! A city! We are doing it, you guys!

372
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,627
You know what they say,

373
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,509
"Where there's a city, there's a spa!"

374
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,965
Who says that?

375
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:40,348
In case you forgot,
we're on a mission to save Equestria.

376
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:41,848
I can multitask.

377
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:51,397
Don't worry, little one,
we'll let you go.

378
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,526
To the highest bidder!

379
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,241
Nice!

380
00:24:56,704 --> 00:24:58,240
Storm King bobbleheads!

381
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:01,990
Ooh. Hey. You with the horn.

382
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,492
You selling?

383
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:08,289
Oh. Ooh!

384
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:10,502
Hi, there.

385
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,796
Oh, I'm sorry.

386
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,627
Here, let me help you with that.

387
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:21,468
Hey, no magic around my merchandise!

388
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:23,390
Hmm?

389
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:25,393
Very interesting.

390
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,392
Okay, we just gotta stick together.

391
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:31,398
Be careful who you talk to,
and try to blend in.

392
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:35,402
Can I have your attention, please?

393
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:42,122
Can anypony take us
to the Queen of the Hippos?

394
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,449
You want something,
you gotta give somethin'.

395
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:47,786
Well, how about a big warm hug
from a grateful pony friend?

396
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:51,039
How about this comb
that I've never used?

397
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,208
A picture of my sister Maud?

398
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:55,756
This breath mint?

399
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:58,634
Seriously, buddy. Help me help you.

400
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:03,013
Pinkie, you can't just take off.

401
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,182
And you don't need to announce
to every--

402
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:08,231
Relax, Twilight, I've totally got this.

403
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:09,979
How much for the giant gecko?

404
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:11,355
Who you callin' a gecko?

405
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:13,778
Uh, Spike isn't for sale.

406
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:15,651
I want that fancy purple hair!

407
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:17,403
I'll give you two Storm Bucks for it.

408
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:20,702
Two Storm Bucks?
It's worth more than that.

409
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:21,869
Heh?

410
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,699
- Give me that pink one!
- I'll take the blue one!

411
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:28,001
- No, I want the blue one!
- I need that lizard!

412
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:29,498
I'll take the picture of your sister!

413
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,046
I want all seven for my collection.

414
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,917
Back up, everyone! Back it up.

415
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:38,169
Y'all in some serious danger!

416
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,471
Now, you didn't touch any of them,
did you?

417
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:43,095
Just look at all those colors.
You think that's natural?

418
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:47,683
They're infected
with pastelus coloritis.

419
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,686
Now you listen here, fella,
there ain't--

420
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:51,732
Don't worry, don't worry.

421
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:55,278
As long as you're
not covered in purple splotches,

422
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:56,696
you'll be fine.

423
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:57,863
Uh-oh.

424
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:00,820
What do I do?

425
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:04,154
Enjoy your last moments.
And don't touch anyone.

426
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:06,456
Because parts will fall off.

427
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,250
Me parts!

428
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:12,704
Well, all right.

429
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:16,591
- You are awesome!
- Mm-hmm.

430
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:18,919
And quite charming.

431
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:25,016
Capper's the name. Charming's my game.

432
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:27,640
So, to the hippos then?

433
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:32,770
I don't know if we should trust him.

434
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,352
We could definitely use
a friend out here.

435
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:38,688
You know what?
Little Cotton Candy Hair is right.

436
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:41,900

00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:00,079
Bohemian hodgepodge.

480
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:02,711
Apologies for the state of
my litter box.

481
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:03,917
I wasn't expecting guests.

482
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,846
Ooh, so many fun breakables!

483
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:10,969
Whoa!

484
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:15,971
Y'all sure y'all want the hippos?

485
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,477
Yessiree!
The Queen of the Hippos.

486
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:20,399
Not like the queen of the lions,

487
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,272
or tigers, or bears?

488
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:23,978
- Oh, my!
- Huh?

489
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:38,160
Please, please, I don't know anything!

490
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:42,251
You really think
the ponies got this far?

491
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:47,756
Oh, they're here.

492
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:50,217
Attention.

493
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:54,179
A little purple pony passed this way.

494
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,052
Tell me where she is.

495
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:58,433
Or somethin' real bad's gonna happen.

496
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:03,852
You think we're gonna fall
for this again?

497
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:06,562
I don't know what kind of scam
you're workin' with Capper

498
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:08,067
and the rest of your friends, but--

499
00:31:08,158 --> 00:31:10,320
Friends?

500
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:14,700
Poison or no poison, you're gonna pay.

501
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:23,250
Oh! Fishman just got dropped!

502
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:25,881
Now...

503
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:28,334
About this Capper...

504
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,933
Stop playin' me. A Sonic Rainboom?

505
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:42,857
That's not a real thing.
Is that a real thing?

506
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:44,229
I'll show ya!

507
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:47,938
No, no, no. I don't need you
Sonic Rainbooming up in my place.

508
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,192
Thank you very much.

509
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,237
Whoa, hey. Hold up now.

510
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:55,410
Whoa.

511
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:58,240
Here you go. I do apologize.

512
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:01,872
If we were back home, I could have
done something truly fabulous.

513
00:32:01,962 --> 00:32:03,203
Okay.

514
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:05,629
- What's the catch?
- Nothing.

515
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:07,422
After all that you've done for us?

516
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:09,171
Consider it a "thank you."

517
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:13,134
Oh. Don't thank me. Really.

518
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:14,805
Guys!

519
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:17,892
We've been looking for the wrong queen!

520
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:20,015
We don't need the Queen of the Hippos.

521
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:22,688
We need the Queen of the Hippogriffs!

522
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,481
Part pony, part eagle.

523
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:27,151
Oh! Oh, the Hippogriffs?

524
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:32,528
Now the trouble with that is,
no one knows where they are.

525
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,325
Says here they're on the top
of Mount Aris.

526
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:37,199
You mean the mountain
right outside the window?

527
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:42,451
Objects in windows may be less
mountainous than they appear.

528
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,919
Let's go, everypony.

529
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:49,465
Wait! You can't--
you can't make it by yourselves!

530
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:51,213
You'd need an airship.

531
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:54,341
And lucky for you, I can get you a ride.

532
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:56,297
I think we can get there on our own.

533
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,683
Here's Verko!

534
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:04,806
These ponies better shoot
rainbow lasers out their eyes

535
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,732
if they're gonna settle your debt.

536
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:08,604
Brought the big cage.

537
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,652
Let's load 'em up!

538
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:15,240
You were...
You were going to sell us?

539
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:16,317
I knew it!

540
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:18,493
We gotta get out of here!

541
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:25,208
Silly little ponies.

542
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:26,627
Tempest!

543
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:34,673
Trusting strangers? Big mistake. Big.

544
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:36,095
Huge!

545
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:37,922
My goodness!

546
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,964
Well, look at you!

547
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:44,554
With your scary broken horn
and scowly eyes.

548
00:33:44,648 --> 00:33:48,733
What tricks do you know,
my little pony wony?

549
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:54,567
Not bad.

550
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:56,398
Go, go!

551
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,160
Get her now!

552
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:01,909
You gonna be scared now, ponies!

553
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:20,093
I'm gonna...

554
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:21,720
Be...

555
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:23,642
Sick!

556
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,571
We have to get there, to the docks!

557
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:43,658
Hurry!

558
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,128
That's it. Don't look down now.

559
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:53,046
Yay!

560
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:54,249
Whoa!

561
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:57,509
Pinkie!

562
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:12,475
Best escape plan ever!

563
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:13,685
What?

564
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,355
Shh.

565
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:21,447
Did you hear something?

566
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:24,279
Yeah, probably just the rats.

567
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:27,619
If we find 'em, we'll eat 'em.

568
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,082
Rats?

569
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:35,335
Now...

570
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:37,208
Where are they going?

571
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:42,304
Okay. No need for violence.

572
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,218
Uh, they're headed...

573
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:55,067
They're headed east.
Yeah, to Black Skull Island.

574
00:35:57,656 --> 00:36:02,117
So, uh, glad I could be of service
to His Majesty, the Storm King.

575
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:03,488
I'll just be on my way.

576
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:06,829
When I get my princess.

577
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:10,955
Until then, your fate is still
up in the air.

578
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:13,707
Oh, you're gonna go in the skiff.

579
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:17,131
Which is a boat, specifically,
a air boat!

580
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:21,010
We make a great team.

581
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:23,884
I love it how you said his fate is up
in the air and then I said,

582
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:26,010
"You're gonna be in the air
in the air boat."

583
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:48,199
Ugh.

584
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:52,329
What do you think, Twilight?
Should we just ask 'em to take us?

585
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:56,374
The last time we trusted somepony,
he tried to sell us.

586
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:01,959
Hey, guys, come check this out.

587
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:05,137
Looks like a pack of stowaways.

588
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,135
What are we s'posed to do with them?

589
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,350
I think we tie 'em up.

590
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:13,016
Nah, we clip their wings!

591
00:37:13,106 --> 00:37:14,722
Nah, we scar 'em...

592
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,232
Emotionally!

593
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:19,606
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

594
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:23,781
What say the book, Captain Celaeno?

595
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:31,496
Storm King's rulebook says...

596
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:35,076
"Throw them overboard."

597
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:41,461
Arr.

598
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:46,925
All right, that's lunch!

599
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:48,547
What?

600
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:58,144
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

601
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:00,942
So, you were about to toss us overboard,

602
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:03,316
and you stopped for a lunch break?

603
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:07,905
Storm King only allows
one break a day for meals

604
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:10,077
then it's back to hauling goods.

605
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:12,871
- So, you're delivery guys?
- And gals.

606
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:15,916
These uniforms aren't exactly
doing us any favors.

607
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,627
Then, can you deliver us to Mount Aris?

608
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:21,501
Sorry. We do what the Storm King orders,

609
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:22,957
or we suffer his wrath.

610
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,923
Right, still going overboard.

611
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:29,756
It's nothing personal. Pudding?

612
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:30,885
There's pudding?

613
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:36,311
You weren't always delivery birds,
were you?

614
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:38,354
What about before the Storm King?

615
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:41,730
Yeah, we used to be
much more adventurous.

616
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:46,112
Ooh! I met that guy in the desert!

617
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:49,909
Whoa! You used to be pirates?

618
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,610
Um, we prefer the term,

619
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:53,912
"Swashbuckling Treasure Hunters."

620
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,614
So, pirates.

621
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:00,419
You birds have a choice to make.

622
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:05,500
You can let some cloven-hoofed Storm
King tell you how to live your lives

623
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:09,382
or you can be awesome again!

624
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:12,180

Come on, let's show
these little ponies how it's done!

666
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,766
Ooh.

667
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:33,780
Awesome!

668
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,657
I knew you had it in you!

669
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:38,156
And now, for the finishing touch!

670
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:42,789
Rainboom, rainboom!

671
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:45,493
- Rainboom, rainboom!
- No, no, no... No!

672
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,507
Ah, yeah!

673
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,516
Wow!

674
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,807
Oh!

675
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:14,863
Huh?

676
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,742
Look at that rainbow!
Look at that rainbow!

677
00:42:18,828 --> 00:42:20,535
Whoa, that's so cool.

678
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:23,452
Yeah, of them to alert us.

679
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:24,997
Funny though,

680
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:27,747
they don't seem to be heading
to Black Skull Island.

681
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:30,837
Like, "Haha" funny, or...

682
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:32,964
Whoa!

683
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,096
Yeah!

684
00:42:43,186 --> 00:42:44,802
Nice!

685
00:42:50,193 --> 00:42:52,435
Storm guards!
Looks like they found you.

686
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:53,644
Tempest!

687
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:56,151
Secure the rigging! Lock down the cargo!

688
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,698
Everyone, prepare to be boarded!

689
00:42:58,785 --> 00:43:00,151
Oh, goodness!

690
00:43:01,871 --> 00:43:03,737
You think she saw my Sonic Rainboom?

691
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:06,365
Are you kidding me?

692
00:43:37,073 --> 00:43:39,156
Where is the pony princess?

693
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:43,361
Princess? Princess, princess...

694
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:46,288
Nope. All we're hauling
is Storm King merchandise.

695
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:55,252
You do realize that if you
were to shelter fugitives

696
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:57,708
the Storm King would be quite...

697
00:43:58,261 --> 00:43:59,627
explosive.

698
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:06,762
We have to get off this ship
before they tell Tempest we're here!

699
00:44:06,853 --> 00:44:09,095
We helped them get their mojo back.

700
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:10,770
They're not gonna give us up!

701
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:19,688
Whoa.

702
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,457
I've got this.

703
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:35,287
Now, I'm gonna to count to three,

704
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:37,748
and if you don't tell me where they are,

705
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:40,175
your ship is going down.

706
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:42,043
One...

707
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:47,265
- Hold this.
- What are you doing?

708
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:48,850
Two...

709
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:53,931
Oh, this is intense.

710
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:57,146
Three!

711
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:00,604
What?

712
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:09,154
Oh, for Celestia's sake!

713
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:16,415
Whee!

714
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,002
I can't look!

715
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:39,688
What in the hay is she up to?

716
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:02,458
Oh, thank goodness.

717
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:03,632
Phew!

718
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,051
Quick thinkin', Twilight!

719
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:07,094
Yahoo!

720
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:09,264
That was fun! Can we do it again?

721
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:12,260
Next stop, Mount Aris!

722
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,185
We're home free!

723
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:16,764
All right!

724
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:31,118
There's no ponies.

725
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:32,742
But I found this.

726
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:37,409
It's a kind of a cupcake,
some sprinkles.

727
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:38,835
Oh, yeah, and I found this, too.

728
00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:45,092
Wow. This is a real artist.

729
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:47,260
Looks like they're heading
to Mount Aris.

730
00:46:48,014 --> 00:46:51,553
Really? Mount... Mount Aris? I didn't...

731
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,850
Well, that's my mistake.
I didn't know that they...

732
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:56,728
Mount Aris, my bad, I didn't...

733
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:59,431
That's my bad. I'm sorry.
I'm very, very sorry.

734
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:01,228
Now...

735
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,607
About your betrayal.

736
00:47:27,887 --> 00:47:29,378
We had to crash the balloon

737
00:47:29,472 --> 00:47:31,384
at the bottom of the mountain?

738
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:35,892
That's it! I simply cannot even!

739
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,477
I have nothing.

740
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:39,270
The bad guys have won!

741
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:41,351
I'm so sorry!

742
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:44,893
We're almost there!

743
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:47,900
Will you stop saying that?

744
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:48,946
No, really.

745
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:52,909
We're actually here!

746
00:47:56,457 --> 00:47:58,369
This is it.

747
00:47:58,459 --> 00:47:59,700
Ooh!

748
00:47:59,794 --> 00:48:01,751
Well, I'll be.

749
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:04,546
Hippogriffs, here we come!

750
00:48:04,632 --> 00:48:07,124
Ooh. Time to rest my hooves.

751
00:48:19,522 --> 00:48:21,980
Are we sure this is the right place?

752
00:48:22,358 --> 00:48:25,692
Hello? Is anypony home?

753
00:48:25,778 --> 00:48:27,565
No Hippogriffies here.

754
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:31,027
Or here. Or here.
Or here. Or here. Or here!

755
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:33,233
Wait...

756
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:35,819
Nope. This place is empty.

757
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:39,910
But Celestia...

758
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:41,745
The map...

759
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:44,085
They have to be here.

760
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:50,008
Something bad happened here.

761
00:48:50,678 --> 00:48:54,672
Something that turned this
whole place into a ghost town.

762
00:48:55,808 --> 00:48:57,674
Ghost town?

763
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:05,974
It's coming from over there.

764
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:29,589
What was that?

765
00:49:30,259 --> 00:49:31,591
Hey! Wait up!

766
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:32,793
Cannonball!

767
00:49:33,596 --> 00:49:34,677
Pinkie!

768
00:49:39,435 --> 00:49:40,471
She's gone.

769
00:49:41,562 --> 00:49:42,803
Now what?

770
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:45,139
- Huh?
- Woah!

771
00:49:46,275 --> 00:49:47,265
Oh, boy.

772
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,692
I hate epic adventures.

773
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:19,013
Way to leave it till
the last minute, Twilight.

774
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:21,845
I didn't make these bubbles.

775
00:50:21,936 --> 00:50:24,349
Then who did?

776
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:30,646
Hello?

777
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,564
We're looking for the Hippogriffs.

778
00:50:33,781 --> 00:50:35,943
How do I know I can trust you?

779
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:38,691
Please.

780
00:50:38,786 --> 00:50:40,652
The Storm King invaded our land,

781
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:42,453
and we need their help.

782
00:50:43,207 --> 00:50:44,539
The Storm King?

783
00:50:46,502 --> 00:50:48,744
I'm so glad I saved you guys!

784
00:50:49,338 --> 00:50:51,500
I'm totally taking you to my mom!

785
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:54,544
Does your mother know
where they are?

786
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:58,049
She might have an idea.

787
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:07,812
We're almost there.

788
00:51:23,122 --> 00:51:24,488
Wow!

789
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:49,975
Mother!

790
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:51,476
Look what I found!

791
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:54,021
Is it another shell?

792
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:55,352
- Mm-mmm.
- Because I am telling you,

793
00:51:55,446 --> 00:51:58,234
if it is another shell, I am--

794
00:51:58,324 --> 00:52:00,611
Princess Skystar, what have you done?

795
00:52:00,701 --> 00:52:03,364
You know surface dwellers
are forbidden here!

796
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:05,446
Guards!

797
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:10,663
No, no, no. Mom, please!
It is so not like that!

798
00:52:10,753 --> 00:52:13,541
The Storm King is trying
to destroy their home, too!

799
00:52:14,048 --> 00:52:15,539
We need to find the Hippogriffs.

800
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:17,124
Do you know what happened to them?

801
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:20,714
Well, of course I know. I'm the queen.

802
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,887
I know everything.

803
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:25,716
Oh, oh. It's such a good story.

804
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:28,222
Don't you dare tell them!

805
00:52:30,022 --> 00:52:32,435
Once upon a time, like, a while ago,

806
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:35,392
the Hippogriffs did live on Mount Aris.

807
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:38,437
Did I not say don't tell them?

808
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:42,194
But, hey, I'm just the queen.
Don't mind me.

809
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:45,823
Fine! I can't tell you.
But if I could tell you,

810
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:47,449
I'd say that that horned beast

811
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:49,451
did show up to steal their magic.

812
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:50,782
Seriously?

813
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:52,367
But to keep it out of his clutches

814
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:56,171
their brave and majestic
leader, Queen Novo,

815
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:59,124
hid them deep underwater
where he could never go.

816
00:52:59,218 --> 00:53:00,959
We are...

817
00:53:01,053 --> 00:53:04,342
Well, we were the Hippogriffs!

818
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:06,218
Tada!

819
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:08,637
But I totally did not tell you that.

820
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:12,854
Well, I guess the pearl
is out the oyster now.

821
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:15,481
I am Queen Novo.

822
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:19,186
Hold on now, let me get this straight.

823
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:21,066
When the Storm King came,

824
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:24,524
you just abandoned
your entire city and fled?

825
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:28,532
We didn't flee, we swam.
You know, in order to flee.

826
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:30,079
But how?

827
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:31,497
Oh! Can we show them?

828
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:33,996
These are the first guests
we've had in, like, forever!

829
00:53:34,086 --> 00:53:35,497
Can we? Can we? Can we...

830
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:41,299
Well, I suppose I should make
sure it still works.

831
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:50,178
Careful now.

832
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:07,571
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

833
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:09,698
Wow.

834
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:11,404
Haha!

835
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:13,956
These fins are divine!

836
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:16,659
Hey, Applejack!
I'll race ya to that coral!

837
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:17,835
You're on!

838
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:19,666
Woo-hoo!

839
00:54:19,757 --> 00:54:21,999
Ooh, try it, Fluttershy.

840
00:54:23,427 --> 00:54:24,338
Yay.

841
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:25,839
Guys...

842
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:29,718
Guys, what is happening?

843
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:31,549
Aw, so cute!

844
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:33,600
This is amazing!

845
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:35,679
With this, we could transform
everypony at home

846
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:38,982
into something powerful enough
to face the Storm King's army!

847
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:42,151
Or it could end up in his greedy claws.

848
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:44,070
- But...
- Honey...

849
00:54:44,156 --> 00:54:47,570
I'm sorry about your home. I truly am.

850
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:51,278
But my responsibility
is to protect my subjects.

851
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:52,786
The pearl...

852
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,992
is not going anywhere.

853
00:54:57,085 --> 00:54:59,247
But we've come all this way.

854
00:54:59,755 --> 00:55:02,498
And you can't just hide down here,
trapped forever.

855
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:04,465
There's so much you're missing.

856
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:08,261
We are 100% okay with that.

857
00:55:08,806 --> 00:55:11,219
Yes, Jamal?

858
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:14,142
Ooh, time for my seaweed wrap.

859
00:55:15,354 --> 00:55:18,392
Yes, a massage, too.
Mama needs her deep tissue.

860
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:20,606
So that's it?

861
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:22,354
We left home for nothin'?

862
00:55:23,195 --> 00:55:24,982
Oh, my gosh!

863
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:27,564
Best idea.

864
00:55:27,658 --> 00:55:30,822
You can stay with us forever!

865
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:34,161
There are so many things we can do.

866
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:36,581
We could make friendship
bracelets out of shells,

867
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:38,158
and picture frames out of shells,

868
00:55:38,252 --> 00:55:41,666
and decorative waste baskets
out of shells.

869
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:43,166
Oh, I have so many projects

870
00:55:43,257 --> 00:55:45,044
that involve shells.

871
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:47,921
Now I have someone new
to share them with.

872
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:50,219
I mean, aside from my friends,
Shelly and Sheldon.

873
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:53,845
Right, Shelly and Sheldon?
Get it?

874
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:56,054
Oh, oh!

875
00:55:56,144 --> 00:55:58,261
That sounds lovely, darling,

876
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:00,938
but you must realize we can't stay.

877
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:02,811
We've gotta get back to our families.

878
00:56:03,861 --> 00:56:06,148
Oh, no. Of course. Of course.

879
00:56:06,864 --> 00:56:08,696
Of course you have
your own friends back home.

880
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:10,364
It's fine. It's fine!

881
00:56:10,993 --> 00:56:12,950
Shelly and Sheldon get jealous anyways.

882
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:14,868
It's probably for the best.

883
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:17,284
Yeah, I'll just, um...

884
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,708
I'll get Mom to turn you back
so you can go home.

885
00:56:25,007 --> 00:56:26,748
I know we have to go,

886
00:56:26,842 --> 00:56:28,583
but you guys saw how disappointed

887
00:56:28,677 --> 00:56:30,293
Princess Skystar was.

888
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:33,509
Couldn't we stay for just
a little longer?

889
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:35,056
Pinkie, we just don't have time--

890
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:38,556
Oh, no. No, no. Pinkie's right.

891
00:56:39,563 --> 00:56:40,599
Say what now?

892
00:56:41,273 --> 00:56:44,437
Well, we still need to come up
with a plan to get back.

893
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:47,189
A few minutes won't make
a huge difference.

894
00:56:47,279 --> 00:56:50,272
And if there's anypony who can
cram a lifetime of fun

895
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:51,776
into a blink of an eye,

896
00:56:51,867 --> 00:56:53,529
it's Pinkie Pie.

897
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:57,912
So go ahead and show Skystar
the best time ever!

898
00:56:58,540 --> 00:56:59,872
I won't let you down!

899
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:02,537
I'm counting on it.

900
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:18,349
It's probably for the best.

one small thing we can do.

950
01:00:24,204 --> 01:00:25,240
The pearl alarm!

951
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:27,413
Oh, no! The pearl alarm!

952
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:32,372
Ow.

953
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:34,085
Ow.

954
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:40,505
No! Please!

955
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:43,838
All of this so you could
sneak in and take the pearl?

956
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:49,094
This is why we don't bring strangers
into our home!

957
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:56,355
You don't deserve to be one of us.

958
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:36,098
What were you thinking?

959
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:38,150
I mean, stealing their pearl?

960
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:41,904
It was the only way
to save Equestria!

961
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:43,777
Except it wasn't!

962
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:46,071
The queen was going to say yes!

963
01:01:46,161 --> 01:01:48,323
We did what you told us,
and that's what made her realize

964
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:50,279
we were ponies worth saving.

965
01:01:50,749 --> 01:01:52,991
Unless,

966
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:55,371
you didn't really want us to
show her the best time ever!

967
01:01:55,837 --> 01:01:58,295
You just wanted us to distract her!

968
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:02,917
I never would have done it,
but this isn't Equestria!

969
01:02:03,303 --> 01:02:05,340
We can't just dance around
with con artists,

970
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:08,673
make rainbooms in the sky,
and expect everything to work out!

971
01:02:08,767 --> 01:02:12,477
It's not enough. We are not enough!

972
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:14,929
No, Twilight. We stuck together.

973
01:02:15,023 --> 01:02:17,060
We were gonna get the help we needed.

974
01:02:17,484 --> 01:02:20,192
The only thing that stopped us was you.

975
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:23,862
Well, I'm doing the best I can!
It's all on me.

976
01:02:23,949 --> 01:02:27,033
I'm the one Tempest wants.
I'm the last princess!

977
01:02:27,118 --> 01:02:30,702
You're also the only one
who doesn't trust her friends!

978
01:02:30,789 --> 01:02:34,157
Well, maybe I would have been better off
without friends like you!

979
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:49,713
Pinkie, I...

980
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:54,268
I just can't talk to you right now.

981
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:41,353
Twilight...

982
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:43,726
It's okay.

983
01:03:44,612 --> 01:03:45,773
You'll figure it out.

984
01:03:48,033 --> 01:03:48,944
No.

985
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:51,741
I can't.

986
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:54,198
I ruined everything.

987
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:58,658
There's no chance to save Equestria now.

988
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:03,086
It's all my fault.

989
01:04:08,178 --> 01:04:09,385
Spike?

990
01:04:09,929 --> 01:04:11,886
Twilight, look out!

991
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:17,138
No, no, no!

992
01:04:19,189 --> 01:04:21,101
Spike!

993
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:23,185
Twilight!

994
01:04:48,927 --> 01:04:51,260
Aw, the Princess of Friendship

995
01:04:52,055 --> 01:04:55,469
with no friends.

996
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:57,808
And no way out.

997
01:04:58,269 --> 01:04:59,931
Why are you doing this?

998
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:02,889
You're a pony, just like me.

999
01:05:04,359 --> 01:05:05,941
I'm nothing like you.

1000
01:05:06,778 --> 01:05:08,895
I'm more than you'll ever be.

I'm so sorry you felt so alone.

1039
01:08:30,481 --> 01:08:31,722
I saw the truth.

1040
01:08:31,816 --> 01:08:35,105
My friends abandoned me
when times got tough.

1041
01:08:36,362 --> 01:08:38,524
Looks like I'm not the only one.

1042
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:42,407
Face it, Princess.

1043
01:08:42,827 --> 01:08:44,534
Friendship has failed you too.

1044
01:08:46,748 --> 01:08:48,535
Friendship didn't fail me.

1045
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:51,537
I failed friendship.

1046
01:09:09,729 --> 01:09:12,437
This whole journey was such a mistake.

1047
01:09:13,441 --> 01:09:16,104
All we wanted was somepony to help us.

1048
01:09:19,739 --> 01:09:23,323
You think maybe it's time
we talk to Twilight?

1049
01:09:24,327 --> 01:09:27,946
She's been taken!

1050
01:09:28,039 --> 01:09:29,120
What?

1051
01:09:29,624 --> 01:09:31,490
Twilight's been taken! Tempest!

1052
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:34,372
She grabbed her and took her
on her ship!

1053
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:38,122
- We gotta get her back!
- How?

1054
01:09:38,216 --> 01:09:40,299
We'll never catch up.

1055
01:09:40,385 --> 01:09:42,843
And we got no way
to defeat those monsters.

1056
01:09:46,265 --> 01:09:47,972
Well, good thing
I happen to know

1057
01:09:48,059 --> 01:09:49,391
of a group of mighty heroes

1058
01:09:49,477 --> 01:09:51,218
that could handle this easily.

1059
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:55,473
Well, look what the cat dragged in.

1060
01:09:55,566 --> 01:09:56,727
Himself!

1061
01:09:57,276 --> 01:09:59,734
These heroes have faced
the Storm King's army

1062
01:09:59,821 --> 01:10:01,107
and escaped.

1063
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:04,156
I've seen them tackle
the streets of the roughest towns,

1064
01:10:04,242 --> 01:10:06,234
break out of the tightest situations,

1065
01:10:06,327 --> 01:10:09,411
and inspire others to join their cause.

1066
01:10:09,497 --> 01:10:11,489
Ooh!

1067
01:10:11,582 --> 01:10:15,542
Now, don't get too excited.
He's just talking about us.

1068
01:10:17,714 --> 01:10:20,081
They even escaped certain doom

1069
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:23,542
at the hooves of Commander Tempest.

1070
01:10:23,636 --> 01:10:26,720
Yeah, that was pretty great.

1071
01:10:26,806 --> 01:10:28,638
Are you kidding me?

1072
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:32,308
That was awesome!

1073
01:10:33,563 --> 01:10:35,395
Figured you could use a claw.

1074
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:38,144
We're onboard to help you
fight the Storm King.

1075
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:40,647
Just not on board our actual ship.

1076
01:10:40,737 --> 01:10:42,820
That crazy unicorn sunk it,

1077
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:45,238
but you got back our argh.

1078
01:10:45,992 --> 01:10:48,200
And we're ready to kick some booty.

1079
01:11:06,179 --> 01:11:08,466
Is that what I think it is?

1080
01:11:11,976 --> 01:11:14,639
Hello! Me again!

1081
01:11:14,729 --> 01:11:17,062
I'm gonna get so grounded.

1082
01:11:17,148 --> 01:11:19,435
But I talked things over
with Shelly and Sheldon,

1083
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:22,268
and they pointed out that you were
just trying to help your friends.

1084
01:11:22,904 --> 01:11:24,236
So, I wanna help, too.

1085
01:11:25,531 --> 01:11:27,989
Because, you know, one small thing...

1086
01:11:28,075 --> 01:11:30,237
Can make a really big difference.

1087
01:11:32,455 --> 01:11:33,571
That's it, right?

1088
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:35,952
We didn't make friends
with anypony else?

1089
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:40,373
All right, y'all.
I think our course is clear.

1090
01:11:41,088 --> 01:11:42,750
Y'all ready to do this thing?

1091
01:11:43,174 --> 01:11:45,666
We're coming, Twilight!

1092
01:11:50,848 --> 01:11:51,679
Yeah!

1093
01:11:51,766 --> 01:11:54,224
As soon as we bake up a plan!

1094
01:12:03,903 --> 01:12:09,274
<i>♪ I am here and I see your pain ♪</i>

1095
01:12:09,867 --> 01:12:15,659
<i>♪ Through the storm through the clouds,
the rain ♪</i>

1096
01:12:15,748 --> 01:12:20,834
<i>♪ I'm telling you, you cannot escape ♪</i>

1097
01:13:05,131 --> 01:13:08,215
Tempest, don't do this.
Don't give the Storm King--

1098
01:13:08,301 --> 01:13:09,212
Your magic?

1099
01:13:10,094 --> 01:13:12,177
Did you think you'd keep it
all to yourself?

1100
01:13:13,097 --> 01:13:14,759
Time to share.

1101
01:13:15,433 --> 01:13:19,677
I'd love for everybody out there to know
what I can really do.

1102
01:13:20,271 --> 01:13:22,103
Ooh, fascinating.

1103
01:13:23,482 --> 01:13:25,769
What can you really do?

1104
01:13:27,028 --> 01:13:29,896
Your bidding, of course,
your mighty one.

1105
01:13:35,494 --> 01:13:37,451
Bidding's good. I like bidding!

1106
01:13:38,164 --> 01:13:40,451
Um, what are you supposed to be?

1107
01:13:41,542 --> 01:13:43,875
I'm the Princess of Friendship.

1108
01:13:43,961 --> 01:13:47,671
Oh!

1109
01:13:48,758 --> 01:13:49,794
That's nice.

1110
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:52,668
Why is this one still moving?

1111
01:13:52,762 --> 01:13:54,924
She and her friends
put up a bit of a fight,

1112
01:13:55,014 --> 01:13:56,471
but she's alone now.

1113
01:13:57,141 --> 01:13:58,882
She won't be a problem.

1114
01:13:58,976 --> 01:14:01,263
Yeah. So, speaking of problems,

1115
01:14:01,354 --> 01:14:03,391
this place, it seems a little too,

1116
01:14:03,481 --> 01:14:05,973
oh, I don't know, cute!

1117
01:14:06,651 --> 01:14:08,893
I don't like cute.
I never did like cute.

1118
01:14:08,986 --> 01:14:11,023
Doesn't really go
with my whole big, bad,

1119
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:13,651
powerful magic guy thing, does it?

1120
01:14:13,991 --> 01:14:15,778
Deliver the punch line, Tempest,

1121
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:17,450
because this has gotta be a joke!

1122
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:24,787
Huh?

1123
01:14:35,262 --> 01:14:36,093
No!

1124
01:14:39,225 --> 01:14:41,057
Check out the light show!

1125
01:14:49,235 --> 01:14:52,273
Wow!

1126
01:14:54,115 --> 01:14:55,947
Let's get this storm started!

1127
01:14:56,033 --> 01:14:58,525
Ooh, hey, that's good,
I should trademark that.

1128
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:09,328
Not bad. Actually, kind of first rate.

1129
01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:10,996
What else does it do?

1130
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:13,047
Your Excellency, you promised

1131
01:15:13,134 --> 01:15:14,875
to restore my horn, and give--

1132
01:15:14,969 --> 01:15:16,505
Uh, uh, uh... Okay, hang on.

1133
01:15:21,392 --> 01:15:23,554
You gotta be kidding me!

1134
01:15:23,644 --> 01:15:27,137
I can move the sun?

1135
01:15:27,231 --> 01:15:28,267
Whoa!

1136
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:31,938
Now this is what I'm talkin' about!

1137
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:35,570
Time to play!

1138
01:15:36,323 --> 01:15:38,781
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday!

1139
01:15:39,201 --> 01:15:43,696
Day, night, day, night, day,
night, day, night, day, night,

1140
01:15:43,789 --> 01:15:47,624
sunrise, sunset...

1141
01:16:00,931 --> 01:16:04,845
Uh, yeah. I got a delivery here
for a "Mr. The Storm King."

1142
01:16:04,935 --> 01:16:08,269
I was given explicit instructions
to bring this here cake

1143
01:16:08,355 --> 01:16:10,597
to this here castle's throne room.

1144
01:16:17,698 --> 01:16:19,360
All right, then.

1145
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:23,160
Look here, could one of y'all
go be a pal, go tell your boss

1146
01:16:23,245 --> 01:16:25,828
he's not getting his
"Congratulations on subduing

1147
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:27,656
defenseless pastel ponies" cake?

1148
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:29,662
'Cause I don't want to be
the one responsible

1149
01:16:29,752 --> 01:16:31,789
for the big guy missin'
his special dessert...

1150
01:16:31,879 --> 01:16:33,211
You know what I'm sayin'?

1151
01:16:42,223 --> 01:16:43,680
Thank you kindly, fellas.

1152
01:16:43,766 --> 01:16:46,474
I'mma be sure and put in a good word
for the both of y'all.

1153
01:16:50,648 --> 01:16:54,483
Pinkie, quit lookin' so happy.
Y'ain't foolin' nopony.

1154
01:16:54,568 --> 01:16:58,357
Oh, okay!

1155
01:17:07,081 --> 01:17:08,913
Mmm, pie.

1156
01:17:09,792 --> 01:17:11,158
Oh, hello, cake.

1157
01:17:14,088 --> 01:17:16,000
Ooh, don't mind if I do.

1158
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:18,415
Mmm.

1159
01:17:18,801 --> 01:17:20,417
It's some, like, gourmet icing.

1160
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:23,552
Who puts eyeballs in filling?

1161
01:17:24,932 --> 01:17:27,140
Guards!

1162
01:17:29,353 --> 01:17:31,185
Uh-oh. Plan B?

1163
01:17:31,272 --> 01:17:32,353
The jig is up!

1164
01:17:41,365 --> 01:17:42,321
Come on!

1165
01:17:45,327 --> 01:17:46,238
Gotcha!

1166
01:17:51,542 --> 01:17:53,204
Argh!

1167
01:17:58,799 --> 01:17:59,789
Lovely.

1168
01:17:59,884 --> 01:18:01,375
Surprise!

1169
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:04,426
Double surprise!

1170
01:18:06,223 --> 01:18:07,134
Whee!

1171
01:18:12,396 --> 01:18:13,887
Oh!

1172
01:18:15,399 --> 01:18:19,063
You seem tense.
Do you wanna talk about it?

1173
01:18:20,905 --> 01:18:22,146
Yeah!

1174
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:28,243
Head for the castle!
We'll hold them off!

1175
01:18:28,329 --> 01:18:29,319
Come on!

1176
01:18:31,916 --> 01:18:33,908
Let it all out.

1177
01:18:34,001 --> 01:18:35,117
Fluttershy!

1178
01:18:35,211 --> 01:18:38,329
Oh, sorry, our time is up, buh-bye!

1179
01:18:38,422 --> 01:18:39,958
Buh-bye.

1180
01:18:47,306 --> 01:18:50,390
Keep going! Shelly, Sheldon...

1181
01:18:52,353 --> 01:18:54,436
I can't see!

1182
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:00,771
Uh-oh.

1183
01:19:01,237 --> 01:19:04,275
Hey, ain't you a firebreathin' dragon?

1184
01:19:17,544 --> 01:19:18,580
What?

1185
01:19:19,213 --> 01:19:20,169
How?

1186
01:19:21,966 --> 01:19:25,505
- It's... It's the magic of--
- Yeah, yeah.

1187
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:29,884
Friendship and flowers
and ponies, and blegh!

1188
01:19:29,974 --> 01:19:32,933
I'm so totally over the cute pony thing.

1189
01:19:33,018 --> 01:19:35,055
This ends now!

1190
01:19:46,532 --> 01:19:47,443
Uh-oh.

1191
01:19:55,291 --> 01:19:56,372
Yeah!

1192
01:20:02,548 --> 01:20:04,210
Move them hooves, ponies!

1193
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:16,468
You'd have to be flying faster than
a speeding Pegasus

1194
01:20:16,562 --> 01:20:18,770
to break through that wind!

1195
01:20:21,108 --> 01:20:23,896
Excellent idea, Rainbow Dash!

1196
01:20:25,112 --> 01:20:29,857
Now, I truly am the Storm King!

1197
01:20:29,950 --> 01:20:36,868
And the entire world will bow
to my ba-ba-ba-boom, baby!

1198
01:20:36,957 --> 01:20:40,871
Yes, yes you are every bit
as powerful as I promised, sire.

1199
01:20:40,961 --> 01:20:46,332
Now, restore my horn and I swear to use
my magic to serve you.

1200
01:20:47,968 --> 01:20:51,461
Who cares about
your dinky little unicorn horn?

1201
01:20:51,555 --> 01:20:54,298
But we, we had an agreement.

1202
01:20:54,391 --> 01:21:00,809
Get with the program!
I used you. It's kind of what I do.

1203
01:21:06,445 --> 01:21:07,401
Argh!

1204
01:21:19,666 --> 01:21:20,827
Hold on!

1205
01:21:21,543 --> 01:21:23,330
Why are you saving me?

1206
01:21:24,421 --> 01:21:27,380
Because this is what friends do.

1207
01:21:37,393 --> 01:21:41,478
Aw, isn't that just so sweet.

1208
01:21:41,563 --> 01:21:43,429
Yeah.

1209
01:21:44,525 --> 01:21:45,436
See ya.

1210
01:21:47,403 --> 01:21:49,144
You sure about this?

1211
01:21:49,238 --> 01:21:51,104
Yes, do it!

1212
01:21:51,698 --> 01:21:53,030
Thank you!

1213
01:21:53,117 --> 01:21:56,406
I'm excited. Who's excited?
I've never been so excited!

1214
01:22:02,668 --> 01:22:04,330
Whee!

1215
01:22:11,468 --> 01:22:12,925
Bullseye!

1216
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:16,296
Pinkie! You all came back!

1217
01:22:16,390 --> 01:22:18,677
I'm so sorry! I was wrong to--

1218
01:22:19,935 --> 01:22:21,517
I'm sorry, too!

1219
01:22:22,354 --> 01:22:24,767
Friends mess up sometimes,
but we never should--

1220
01:22:24,857 --> 01:22:27,895
Uh, make up later! This isn't over!

1221
01:22:45,752 --> 01:22:47,539
I've got to get control of it!

1222
01:22:47,629 --> 01:22:50,542
Go! You've got this, Twilight!

1223
01:22:51,258 --> 01:22:54,092
No. We've got this.

1224
01:22:55,345 --> 01:22:56,256
Together.

1225
01:23:04,688 --> 01:23:06,395
Whee!

1226
01:23:09,860 --> 01:23:12,819
The staff belongs to me!

1227
01:23:21,705 --> 01:23:24,493
No! That's my staff!

1228
01:23:31,131 --> 01:23:33,498
Mine! Mine!

1229
01:23:34,176 --> 01:23:35,087
No!

1230
01:23:36,053 --> 01:23:38,090
- Oh, no, no!
- Whoa!

1231
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:40,091
Twilight!

1232
01:23:40,474 --> 01:23:43,638
No!

1233
01:24:42,995 --> 01:24:44,031
Yay!

1234
01:24:44,121 --> 01:24:46,955
- Yeehaw! All right!
- Yay.

1235
01:24:47,791 --> 01:24:49,032
Group hug!

1236
01:25:14,693 --> 01:25:16,355
No!

1237
01:25:53,899 --> 01:25:54,980
Whoa.

1238
01:25:55,651 --> 01:25:57,563
I can't believe she did that.

1239
01:25:58,445 --> 01:25:59,356
I can.

1240
01:26:16,213 --> 01:26:17,624
Now what?

1241
01:26:29,309 --> 01:26:32,347
Now, we fix everything.

1242
01:26:46,576 --> 01:26:49,319
Ah! Twilight!

1243
01:26:49,788 --> 01:26:50,744

1248
01:27:45,844 --> 01:27:49,463
the fact that we're all
still here in one piece,

01:27:49,556 --> 01:27:52,299
give it up for Princess Twilight

01:27:52,392 --> 01:27:55,055
and her friends!

1251
01:27:55,145 --> 01:27:57,728
