Look at these lovely toiletries

3
0:0:5.535 --> 0:0:7.803
Merlin very kindly gave me
as a leaving present.

4
0:0:7.836 --> 0:0:9.072
Here, try this aftershave.

5
0:0:10.238 --> 0:0:11.941
Yeah, I know, Harry.
I'm wearing it.

6
0:0:14.843 --> 0:0:16.213
Listen, you can't just give up.

7
0:0:17.412 --> 0:0:18.581
Give up?

8
0:0:18.615 --> 0:0:21.718
No, on the contrary.
I'm about to achieve my dream.

9
0:0:21.751 --> 0:0:22.985
Researching rare butterflies

10
0:0:23.019 --> 0:0:25.455
alongside some of the finest
minds in entomology.

11
0:0:35.164 --> 0:0:38.802
You know, you may as well
have me stuck up on this wall.

12
0:0:38.834 --> 0:0:42.438
'Cause you're never gonna find a butterfly
more interesting than me.

13
0:0:42.472 --> 0:0:43.572
Sorry?

14
0:0:43.606 --> 0:0:48.077
When you and I first met,
I was just, like, a maggot.

15
0:0:48.110 --> 0:0:49.479
Maggots turn into flies.

16
0:0:49.512 --> 0:0:51.080
Perhaps you mean larva.

17
0:0:51.113 --> 0:0:53.048
Larva, yeah, okay.
Whatever. The point is...

18
0:0:53.081 --> 0:0:55.150
everyone wanted to squash me.

19
0:0:56.385 --> 0:0:57.753
But not you.

20
0:0:57.787 --> 0:1:0.857
You helped me
to become a caterpillar.

21
0:1:0.889 --> 0:1:2.491
And now I've got wings.

22
0:1:3.459 --> 0:1:5.494
I'm flying higher
than I ever dreamed.

23
0:1:5.528 --> 0:1:7.330
And that is all thanks to you.

24
0:1:7.363 --> 0:1:9.398
I hate to seem rude,
but I need to finish packing

25
0:1:9.432 --> 0:1:10.600
and get some sleep.

26
0:1:10.633 --> 0:1:12.034
Harry, you can't just walk away.

27
0:1:12.068 --> 0:1:13.636
Kingsman needs you.

28
0:1:13.669 --> 0:1:15.972
The whole world needs you.

29
0:1:18.773 --> 0:1:20.342
I need you.

30
0:1:21.211 --> 0:1:23.446
Eggy, whoever the Harry was

31
0:1:23.479 --> 0:1:25.982
that you knew,
he's gone, I'm afraid.

32
0:1:26.347 --> 0:1:27.416
Goodbye.

That's not a martini.

It is in Kentucky.

Fair enough.

Please leave a message.

Can I have
another martini, please?

Sure.
