Now, let's talk about the STIC test

3
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:59,120
or Standardised Test for
International Colleges,

4
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,290
which tests for general
knowledge and

5
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:04,820
it is used to apply to bachelor
programmes in the U.S.

6
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,460
This year the association
overseeing the examination

7
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,660
has uncovered a
cheating scandal,

8
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,470
which has led to the exam leaking in
in various countries in Asia.

9
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:18,740
Further investigation
is pending...

10
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,890
That's not mine.

11
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:37,990
My name is Rinrada Nilthep.

12
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:39,790
I'm in Grade 12, class 3

13
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,830
at Krungthep Thaweepanya School.

14
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,400
You can call to check
my school records.

15
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,540
The STIC exam isn't
beyond my ability.

16
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:25,200
<b>BAD GENIUS</b>

17
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,940
Student Portfolio:
Ms. Rinrada Nilthep

18
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,440
This student has achieved a 4.00 GPA
in Grade 7, Academic Year 2011

19
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,710
<b>GRADE 9</b>

20
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,650
Straight A's since Grade 1.

21
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,820
Honour student since
Grade 7 to Grade 9.

22
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,590
Came in first place in the school
district's Maths Competition.

23
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,630
National Crossword Champion.

24
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:49,430
There's also achievements in sports...

25
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:50,960
this one is...

26
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,200
For swimming.

27
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:53,630
That's fine, Vit.

28
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,570
This is more than enough.

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,340
No need to ask whether we
would accept Lynn or not.

30
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:02,310
The important question is...

31
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,080
do you want to study here?

32
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,480
What do you say, honey?

33
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:14,650
I don't have to
decide now, right?

34
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,460
It's not that I don't
want to study here.

35
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,860
It's just that my old school
is more suitable for me.

36
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,800
If I move here, my dad

37
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,200
will have to pay 150,000 per year.

38
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,040
How is it 150,000?

39
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,500
One semester is only 60,000,

40
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,840
so it only comes up to 120,000.

41
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,080
Correct. However, my dad
taught at my old school, 

42
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,720
So I can go with him to
school every morning.

43
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,650
If I study here, I'd have
to take the skytrain

44
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:51,190
including calling motortaxis from the
station to home is 80 baht everyday...

45
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,630
for 8 months, which is 170 days,

46
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:58,230
excluding holidays.

47
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:00,870
It's approximately
13,600 baht per year.

48
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,540
There's also lunch,

49
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:06,710
At my old school it only
costs 20 baht for 2 sides with rice.

50
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,410
Here it's 35 baht.

51
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:12,680
I'll also have to buy new
school supplies and uniforms.

52
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,750
I think all in all...
 
53
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,980
it might not be worth it.

54
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,730
Gold medal in maths.

55
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,730
Honey...

56
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,100
I can afford it.

57
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,330
No, you can't.

58
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,030
What if we let you study for free?

59
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:45,480
Vit, I'll add free
lunch as well, okay?

60
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,950
We want want to see that
we value geniuses like Lynn.

61
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,280
Is it worth it now?

62
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:55,490
Worth it.

63
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,790
Worth bringing all this.

64
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,860
It's worth it, right?

65
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,400
Letter of Authorisation

66
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,530

Alright, done.

69

One second!

70
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,780
This ID is gonna be
with us for 3 years.

71
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,980
You gotta look good.

72
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:27,620
Okay?

73
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,930
You just moved here, right?

74
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,290
I'm Grace.

75
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:36,490
I'm Lynn.

76
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:42,570
What are you doing?

77
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,940
Can I have a look?

78
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,500
Take off your glasses.

79
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,540
Trust me.

80
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,410
Wow!

81
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:54,350
Pretty!

82
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,380
Smile. C'mon.

83
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,590
Okay. Ready 1... 2.

84
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,120
Go.

85
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,060
You're next. Quickly.

86
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,500
Grace

87
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,750
My ID number is after hers, so
we sat next to each other for 3 years.

88
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,750
Actually, Lynn and I are really close.

89
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,550
But everyone says Lynn's a genius.
But I'm...

90
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,360
I'm good at extracurricular
activities.

91
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,030
Sometimes, people might
even call me stupid.

92
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:51,200
The Headmistress came
up with a new policy this semester.

93
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:56,980
To be in a school play, you
need at least a 3.25 GPA.

94
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:01,110
Why? Am I too stupid
to be in a school play?

95
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,880
I think...

96
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:07,890
acting is harder than studying.

97
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,090
Really?

98
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,320
Really.

99
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:18,300
Look, I've been tutoring
with Mr. Sophon for weeks,

100
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,170
but I still don't know shit.

101
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:23,370
And maths really pulls
my grades down.

102
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,040
The answer is C.

103
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,010
What! You got the answer
just by glancing?

104
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:30,980
Upside down, too!

105
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,680
It's super easy.

106
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:41,290
"A union B, intersect with C."
Do the one's in the parentheses first,

107
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,960
then "intersect with C"
is just whatever's left in C.

108
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,290
That's the answer.

109
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:49,730
Oh! I get it.

110
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,200
Scholarship kids really are smart.

111
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,170
Another one?

112
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,380
Lynn, will you be my tutor?

113
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:08,650
Why not?

114
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,450
If you teach me,

115
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:13,420
I'll buy you a milkshake
after school every day.

116
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:15,290
Nah.

117
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,320
You'll get to review the
lesson every evening.

118
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,620
Not enough.

119
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:21,790
What about...

120
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,660
If you agree,

121
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,070
I'll get to be your first
student, Mentor Lynn.

122
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,410
Mentor Lynn.

123
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:36,540
Mentor Lynn.

124
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:41,410
Mentor Lynn!

125
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:42,950
That got me.

126
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:46,320
I'll teach you all
of this today.

127
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,550
Grace told you I helped
with her studies?

128
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:51,660
That's right.

129
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:56,460

been waiting for.

132
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:05,370
Pass the test paper.

133
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,210
That's enough. Take a deep
breath, clear your mind.

00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:30,660
No.

147

Why not? I already taught you!

No talking, no cheating!

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,580
It's convenient.

167
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,290
You have a swimsuit, right?

168
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,540
Pat, will it kill you to
just get in pool like a normal person?

169
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,840
Nope...

170
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,110
but it's not cool.

171
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,370
I got water in my ear.

172
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,580
Mr. Pat, dinner is served.

173
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,840
Just leave it.

174
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,550
Babe, I'm cold.

175
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,790
Pat

176
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,900
Are you coral watching, Grace?

177
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,510
To be honest, I've told Grace to invite
you over to my place a bunch of times.

178
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,840
We're all in the same class,
but we hardly ever talk.

179
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:18,840
But Grace though,

180
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,710
always Lynn this... Lynn that.

181
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:21,910
Shut up.

182
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,410
Are you jealous?

183
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,490
Grace says that you're
good at everything.

184
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:30,560
Without you, her grades
wouldn't have improved.

185
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,490
I even told her that...

186
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,130
I want to have a
friend like you.

187
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:39,360
I've seen you with
a bunch of friends.

188
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:40,630
You're right,

189
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:45,540
but no one lends me their
eraser during exams.

190
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,110
Why?

191
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,550
Why? You want to be in
the school play as well?

192
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:03,550
Smart people like you
don't understand.

193
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,460
Idiots like me,

194
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,160
we all want good grades.

195
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:09,690
Damn.

196
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:11,330
Hey, babe!

197
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,030
Dad said if I don't fail this semester
he'll will get me a new car.

198
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,400
Sounds good?

199
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:25,610
I know that we aren't tight...

200
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,410
but if you agree...

201
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,980
I'll pay you 3,000 per subject.

202
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,550
This is per person.

203
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,890
Per person?

204
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:36,920
Yeah.

205
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:39,590
What do you mean?

206
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:41,030
I've got 5 more friends.

207
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:44,360
What if the teachers find out?

208
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,360
Don't worry about that.

209
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,470
All my friends can be trusted.

210
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:51,570
And all my friends are willing to pay.

211
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,440
Think about it, this
is only one subject.

212
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:59,410
And each semester has...
how many subjects, Grace?

213
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,880
Not including PE...

214
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:01,910
13, right?

215
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,450
So each semester,
you'll get...

216
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,680
13 times...

217
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,620
234,000 baht.

218
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,520
Nice digits as well: 234,000.

219
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,330
In exchange for your brains.

220
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,500
Tick-tock.

221
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:24,170
Call it even for the
school's 'tea money'.

222
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,570
What tea money?

223
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,610
Seriously?

224
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,270
You really don't know?

225
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,440
Everyone pays.

226
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,980
The stupider you are,
the more you pay.

227
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,050
I paid 400,000.

228
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:40,050
And this dumbass donated 20
iMac's to the library.

229
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,790
But I got a scholarship.

230
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:45,060
The scholarship is for studying.

231
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,460
Don't forget about
the maintenance fees.

232
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:07,110
Receipt:
New Student Fee - 200,000 baht

233
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,500
Divorce Papers

234
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,030
What mood are you in?

235
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:04,670
You know, I was going to sell
it to buy a new car.

236
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,700
Since you never play it anymore.

237
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,640
I just remembered yesterday
was Mom's birthday.

238
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:24,160
Why were you so eager to 
make me move to this school?

239
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,190
Most students from this school

240
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:30,160
get scholarships
to study abroad.

241
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,800
I wanted to give you
opportunities your old school couldn't offer.

242
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,540
I'm not like Mom, you know.

243
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:39,900
Have you ever thought that

244
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,440
I might be happier
at my old school?

245
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,550
Three points.

246
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:54,190
Don't be too loud and disturb
the neighbors. Eat dinner.

247
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,620
I'm going to bed.

248
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:05,420
Okay, I admit I paid Lynn.

249
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,730
But paying her for
piano lessons...

250
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:12,530
isn't against any laws, right?

251
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,130
Or is it?

252
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,540
Will you send me to
international court?

253
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:22,210
Have you ever heard
that classical music

254
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:24,540
helps with the
brain's development?

255
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,440
We'll use 4 songs
to represent

256
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:30,920
A, B, C and D.

257
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,290
Memorize my right hand movements.

258
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,690
This is A.

259
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:45,630
Remember that it starts with the pinky
and finishes with the thumb.

260
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:48,870
This is B.

261
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:52,670
B is 4 3 2 1 3, repeated twice.

262
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:58,040
This is C.

263
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:02,150
This one D.

264
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,420
I'll give you 3
answers and skip 1.

265
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,920
I'll repeat this pattern.

266
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,950
So that the scores are scattered.

267
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:11,990
This'll keep the marks in check,
and not alert any teachers.

268
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:14,930
You must complete every question
that is the multiple of 4. 

269
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:23,030
I'll start giving the
answers at 9:15 a.m.

270
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:24,840
Meanwhile, complete the
remaining questions.

271
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,860
D.

272
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:16,450
Lynn.

273
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,590
This shirt is expensive.

274
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,290
Are you getting rich from
teaching piano?

275
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:25,360
You can wear new
clothes too, you know.

276
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:28,200
They tease you at school
that you're a scrooge.

277
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:31,800
I wouldn't mind a new
pair of trousers too.

278
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,740
"Classical Piano Lessons
by Mentor Lynn"

279
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:43,280
More people want to
join your piano class.

280
00:23:51,790 --> 00:24:00,030
Congratulations to Scholarship
Students, Academic Year 2013

281
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:09,510
<b>GRADE 11</b>

282
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:16,450
Bank

283
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:26,090
Stay tuned for Teen Genius
after the break!

284
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,400
It's true that Lynn and I study at
the same school.

285
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,540
But we're not friends.

286
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,600
Actually, we're rivalries.

287
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,110
What's wrong, Bank?
Are you nervous?

288
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,680
Uh-huh.

289
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,210
Did you have noodles for lunch?

290
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,150
How'd you know?

291
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,550
You've got some on your shirt.

292
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,090
Dirty and wrinkled.

293
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:05,160
Here. A wet wipe.

294
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,630
For your shirt.

295
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,110
Hey! If we win we'd get 5,000 baht!

296
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:18,980
We'll actually get
less than that.

297
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:21,780
With 3% tax deduction:
which is 150.

298
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,150
So it's only 4,850
or 2,425 each.

299
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,680
It's still a lot.

300
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,490
It's enough for a salmon buffet.

301
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:34,690
If we win, you wanna
go this evening?

302
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,700
No.

303
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:44,370
I don't like eating outside.

304
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,440
It's a waste of money.

305
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,010
What are you laughing at?

306
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:51,610
Nothing. You sound
just like my dad.

307
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,280
Is that good or bad?

308
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,150
Of course, It's a good thing.

309
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:59,420
Messy hair, wrinkled
shirt. Exactly like him.

310
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,520
What? I'm just gonna
fix your hair.

311
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:10,290
We're going on TV, the least
you can do is look good.

312
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,070
Looking handsome.

313
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:23,970
Ready?

314
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,380
Hmm.

315
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,650
<i>Final question.</i>

316
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:42,730
<i>Tell me the Pi value with as many
decimal places as possible.</i>

317
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:46,100
3.141592653589793...

318
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,400
That's enough, that's enough!

319
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:51,200
And the winner of this
week's Teen Genius is...

320
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,870
Krungthep Thaweepanya School!

321
00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:01,550
I'm really awestruck. How did
divide the Pi value so quickly?

322
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:05,480
I didn't divide it.
I just memorized it.

323
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,050
You memorized the value of Pi?

324
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:13,660
I used to play memory
games with my dad.

325
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,660
Pi's value, names of
people, and reservoir names.

326
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:21,900
Brilliant, this is why you're
our scholarship student.

327
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,530
Have a seat.

328
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,940
I didn't ask you to come
only to praise you.

329
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:31,410
I also have good news for you.

330
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:36,650
Next year, the Singaporean Embassy
is offering scholarships for Thai students.

331
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,450
No strings attached.
It's a full scholarship.

332
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:43,090
You can study a bachelors and
finish with a doctorate.

333
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:46,460
Considering your grades,
behaviour and determination,

334
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:52,160
There's only you two who are
the school's best representatives.

335
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,800
There's a catch though.

336
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:01,610
Each school can only send one
student for the scholarship.

337
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:03,670
But that shouldn't
be a problem, right?

338
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:07,480
Yesterday, you two
were teammates.

339
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:11,480
But from now on, you're now rivals.
Isn't this fun?

340
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:36,410
<font color="#FFD700">Little Bank Laundry Service</font>

341
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,140
The washing machine broke again.

342
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,850
I can't finish the
laundry in time.

343
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:58,530
Don't worry. I'll
take care of it.

344
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,730
Your hands are all calloused.

345
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:19,050
It's understandable
if you think I cheated...

346
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,620
but thinking that Bank
would cheat too?

347
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,490
Aside from my father,

348
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,360
Bank is the only other honest
and hard-working person

349
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,700
I've ever known in my entire life.

350
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:36,830
Hey, Bank!

351
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,440
What's up, Tong?

352
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,100
Did you finish studying for the exam?

353
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:44,210
Me too, man.

354
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,680
I was sick and didn't
finish studying.

355
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,240
Exactly the same,

356
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,280
Go finish studying.

357
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,880
Dude, please help me!

358
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:58,820
Let me copy you.

359
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:04,190
I really can't fail this time.

360
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,130
I've tried...

361
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,830
but this piano code is
just too hard for me.

362
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,200
What piano code?

363
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,340
Oh-- No--
It's nothing.

364
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:19,680
Hey, I won't copy you for free.

365
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,050
I'll pay you.

366
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,380
3,000 baht, enough?

367
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:30,350
Letting me copy
won't lower your marks.

368
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,990
Wait! Listen to me!

369
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:34,960
Bank!

370
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:36,090
Bank!

371
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:37,190
Bank!

372
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,460
Bank!

373
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:41,630
Damn it, Bank! Can't
you help a friend?

374
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,730
You're goddamn heartless!

375
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,200
Hurry, hurry.

376
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:18,540
Today you're all taking
the test together.

377
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:20,540
Don't sit next to
your classmates.

378
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:37,290
All right, you may
start your test.

379
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:42,730
Grade 11, class 1

380
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:43,460
Grade 11, class 4

381
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:44,730
Grade 11, class 3

382
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:45,460
Grade 11, class 6

383
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:06,080
<font color="#000000">40. Your exam paper is set 1.</font>

384
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:14,860
Sir, how do we
answer question 40?

385
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:16,690
There are two sets
of test papers.

386
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:19,600
Just answer according
to the one you have.

387
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:30,840
<font color="#000000">A. Set 1</font>

388
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:32,110
<font color="#000000">B. Set 2</font>

389
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:25,130
Be careful of Tong copying.

390
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:39,940
Lynn! Which set did you get?

391
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,420
So, which set?

392
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,490
Set 1.

393
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,830
Leave set 1 here.

394
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,170
What?

395
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,170
Row 3.

396
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:07,740
Banjong.

397
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,510
Crew cut with glasses.

398
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:13,610
He's copying Rinrada, she's
sitting next to him.

399
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:18,920
I'll take care of it.

400
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:19,820
Don't worry.

401
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,080
You can go.

402
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:25,590
What now?

403
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:33,330
30 minutes left.

404
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,000
<font color="#000000">A. Set 1</font>

405
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,560
Tong.

406
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,660
Huh?

407
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,130
Switch the papers.

408
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:17,200
Now!

409
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,000
Banjong Wongpoom

410
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:25,680
20 minutes left.

411
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:30,810
Lynn. Lynn.

412
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:31,650
What?!

413
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:34,080
Should I erase your name
and write mine instead?

414
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,820
No! Just sit still.

415
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:58,370
10 minutes left.

416
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,700
Last 5 minutes.

417
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,180
<font color="#000000">B. Set 2</font>

418
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,680
Time's up.

419
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,750
Stop writing!

420
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,760
Hey!

421
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:21,620
Put your pencils down!

422
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,700
That's enough!

423
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,750
Don't you already have enough A's?
That's it!

424
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,450
[Jeez, the teacher's playing hardball.]

425
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:25,560
[That was close. Thank you, Mentor Lynn]

426
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,000
Is it worth it?
Being this risky.

427
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:37,330
Well, it is 3,000 for 25 per person.

428
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,130
What do you think?

429
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,340
Rinrada!

430
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:44,870
You didn't write your
name on the scrap paper.

431
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:51,450
Rinrada, Grade 11, class 3

432
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:53,250
and Banjong Grade 11, class 1,

433
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,950
report to the Headmistress's
office immediately.

434
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,290
I assure you.

435
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,590
If you don't believe me, then
have Tong retake the test.

436
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,390
You'll know the truth.

437
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,730
I've called the
both of you in...

438
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,410
because Thanaphon said
there's been some cheating.

439
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:21,040
There are 2 sets of test papers.
There's no point of cheating.

440
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:40,460
I'm giving you a chance
to tell the truth.

441
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:42,900
Banjong, did you cheat?

442
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,610
We'll find out soon enough.

443
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:57,450
Thanaphon and Rinrada,
you're excused.

444
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,420
Banjong, you stay here.

445
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:10,990
Lynn, don't leave yet.

446
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:18,130
How did you do these problems
on your scrap paper?

447
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:22,210
Since these problems are
not on the set you got.

448
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:41,820
Please don't get caught us.

449
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,530
Don't worry about it,

450
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:50,330
The Headmistress probably wants
to discuss about the scholar--

451
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:04,710
We have evidence that

452
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:06,880
Lynn completed her
friend's paper.

453
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:11,420
Lynn.

454
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,590
Explain why you did it.

455
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:17,860
If you don't, then
I will expel you.

456
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:21,860
For the money.

457
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,500
Tong tried to hire
me to do his test.

458
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:30,940
3,000 baht.

459
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:37,550
I'm very disappointed in you.

460
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:39,750
Vit...

461
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:41,980
I accepted your
daughter because

462
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:44,550
she's an honor student.

463
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:47,420
But it's not just about
being an good student,

464
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,190
it's also about having good disipline.

465
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:53,400
You're a teacher, you
should understand.

466
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,730
Completing your friend's
exam paper is cheating.

467
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:57,930
It's a gross violation
of school policy.

468
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,370
To be honest,
I could expel you right now.

469
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:05,740
Seeing that this
is your first time,

470
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:08,980
I'll just cancel
your scholarship.

471
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:18,150
Yes, ma'am.

472
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:26,500
To be honest, having Tong and Lynn
retake the test should be enough...

473
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:31,400
Remember Lynn.

474
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,670
School is a place for studying,

475
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,770
not a place for making money.

476
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:39,680
What are you laughing at?

477
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:42,080
Where are your manners?

478
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,210
Nothing.

479
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:44,210
Mr. Pravit,

480
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,780
you're a teacher, didn't
you teach her manners?

481
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:51,990
Sorry.

482
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:55,990
I don't think I'm the only one

483
00:43:56,130 --> 00:43:57,990
who uses the school
to make money.

484
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:02,300
What do you mean?

485
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:05,570
I'm talking about the
'tea money' that my dad paid.

486
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,540
It's not called 'tea money'.

487
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:13,210
It's the school maintenance fee.

488
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:17,280
Isn't school maintenance fee
included in the tuition fee?

489
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:18,580
Stop, Lynn!
That's enough.

490
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:29,030
Please let her study here.

491
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:31,230
I'll take care of the
remaining tuition.

492
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:32,330
Let's go.

493
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,400
Fine.

494
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:37,130
I have one condition.

495
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,510
You're banned from the
Singapore Scholarship.

496
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:54,820
Okay, okay.

497
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:55,950
Let's go.

498
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:57,750
What's the scholarship
have to do with it?

499
00:44:58,190 --> 00:45:00,120
It's true that I let
my friend copy me,

500
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:02,020
but I've never copied anyone.

501
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:06,800
All the grades that I've gotten
reflect my actual abilities.

502
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:09,630
These abilities,
other students have them too.

503
00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:13,000
There's also people who deserve
this scholarship like Thanaphon.

504
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,910
If you can't accept
this condition,

505
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:18,670
then you can resign.

506
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,110
All right, Mr. Pravit?

507
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:25,380
Yes, ma'am.

508
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:26,920
Let's go, Lynn.

509
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:33,420
Good luck with the scholarship.

510
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:50,940
Well, if you found evidence...

511
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:54,480
I guess Lynn really did cheat.

512
00:45:57,910 --> 00:45:59,550
But I have nothing
to do with it.

513
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:04,320
Being an honor student
doesn't mean...

514
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:07,090
we have the same behaviour.

515
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,630
Ms. Rinrada Nilthep

516
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:14,660
I knew it.

517
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:17,370
I knew you didn't do it just for 3,000 baht.

518
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:21,840
Piano lessons?

519
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:31,780
Did you ever think that it'd
actually be better to actually tutor them?

520
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:35,450
But the Headmistress
cheated us first.

521
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:39,190
How can you call it cheating,
when I paid willingly.

522
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:40,190
My friends also paid willingly!

523
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:42,330
Can't you see you did wrong?!

524
00:46:57,370 --> 00:46:58,410
Ok.

525
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,140
I'll take the blame.

526
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:03,780
It's my fault.

527
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:06,450
Who am I to blame?

528
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:12,190
If I can't raise my daughter
to be a good person,

529
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:16,160
then why should I go ask for
scholarships for my daughter?

530
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:28,100
I'll sell the car to pay for
the rest of the tuition fee.

531
00:47:30,970 --> 00:47:32,170
As for this shirt...

532
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:36,550
I don't want it anymore.

533
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:41,750
About going abroad,
just forget it!

534
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,320
You're not going anywhere.

535
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:46,420
You're staying here with me.

536
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:50,130
Return all the money to your
friends by the end of the semester.

537
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:14,780
You can think that
Lynn is a bad person,

538
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,420
but to me...

539
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:19,860
she's truly a good friend.

540
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:30,700
Sorry for being such a crybaby,

541
00:48:31,530 --> 00:48:33,670
but I'm not just acting.

542
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:42,880
<b>GRADE 12</b>

543
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:53,920
So? Does it look refreshing?

544
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:56,160
Not bad.

545
00:48:57,030 --> 00:48:58,730
I'm casting is tomorrow.

546
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,830
You didn't call me just
for this, right?

547
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:07,040
How are you guys getting along?

548
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:10,540
You can take care of yourselves
for last two semesters, right?

549
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:16,780
Pat and I have other
things to worry about.

550
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:23,050
<i>Has Pat told you, yet?</i>

551
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:25,190
We just got back from France.

552
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:27,820
The trip was so fun!

553
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,030
Yeah, 'cause you left your son behind.

554
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,630
Well, I've got to go shopping too.

555
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:35,130
- Mom.
- I got you something too.

556
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,730
- Pat.
- Yes?

557
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:38,730
Go fetch a red wine
in the cellar for me.

558
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:41,340
Why don't you ask
the housekeeper to do it?

559
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:49,910
Yes, sir.

560
00:49:57,790 --> 00:50:00,020
Grace, would you like
any more dessert?

561
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,290
No, thank you.

562
00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:04,960
We invited you over today

563
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:07,160
because we would
like to thank you.

564
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,370
Thank me for what?

565
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:12,540
For helping Pat
with his studies.

566
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:15,100
You have no idea...

567
00:50:15,370 --> 00:50:17,910
how disappointed we've
been over his grades.

568
00:50:18,370 --> 00:50:21,210
But ever since Pat's
been seeing you,

569
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,080
he's like a totally
different person.

570
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:31,050
I think you're better than
all those famous tutors.

571
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:39,030
To be honest, we've
been planning this for some time.

572
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:43,730
We wanted Pat to study at the
same university as I did, at Boston.

573
00:50:44,870 --> 00:50:48,540
But looking at his previous grades...

574
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,340
I knew he wouldn't make it.

575
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:54,040
So, I thought that...

576
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:56,910
you should go with him.

577
00:50:57,310 --> 00:50:58,780
So you can help him study there.

578
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:01,650
Sounds good, right?

579
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:15,970
Don't worry about the expenses.

580
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:19,030
Share the living expenses with Pat.

581
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:21,670
As for tuition fees...

582
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:24,870
if you need any help...

583
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:28,780
you can let us know. Anytime.

584
00:51:31,450 --> 00:51:33,080
I've some information
for you already.

585
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:35,120
You can take a look at it.

586
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:43,490
If money isn't an issue,
say yes, all right?

587
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:55,540
You know of the
STIC test, right?

588
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:59,540
It's like GAT/PAT, used to
apply to American universities.

589
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:01,580
It's the same test
at the same time, worldwide.

590
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:03,610
I need to take the STIC...

591
00:52:04,110 --> 00:52:06,550
and I need to take
it within this year.

592
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:09,450
If not...

593
00:52:09,550 --> 00:52:13,160
I won't be able to apply
to the university in time.

594
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:22,060
I've already been
busted once, Grace.

595
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:30,770
I'm not comfortable
asking you for help either

596
00:52:31,870 --> 00:52:34,110
but we really don't
know what to do.

597
00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:39,480
But Pat said he'll pay
you 600,000 baht.

598
00:53:24,730 --> 00:53:27,200
Could you return this to Pat?

599
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:28,500
Yes, alright.

600
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,300
Could I borrow a pen
and some paper as well?

601
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:41,140
"I really can't help you guys this time. Sorry!!"

602
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:43,750
Miss.

603
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:57,960
- Hi baby, I'm so glad that you called.
- Hi dad.

604
00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:02,300
It's so bright there.
What time is it?

605
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:03,830
It's noon, dad.

606
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,640
I hope you have a lot
of fun in Thailand!

607
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,710
Can you see what's time
it is here? Can you see?

608
00:54:10,770 --> 00:54:12,210
Why it's so dark there?

609
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:13,610
It's nap time here.

610
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:16,480
Okay. I've got to check in.

611
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,450
Okay. Can I call you back later?

612
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:20,550
Good night.

613
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:21,680
Bye-bye.

614
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,370
Time zones.

615
00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:19,610
The STIC is taken at the same
time and date worldwide.

616
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:23,950
This means countries here will take
the test earlier than the rest.

617
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:27,750
Simply,

618
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:29,590
If you two take it in Thailand

619
00:55:29,650 --> 00:55:32,650
while I fly over and take
the test somewhere earlier.

620
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:34,790
Like Sydney, Australia.

621
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:36,460
4 hours ahead of Thailand.

622
00:55:37,090 --> 00:55:38,990
I will get to see
the exam first.

623
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:40,960
Complete it first.

624
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,900
And send you guys the answers,

625
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,800
along with the others taking the test in
Thailand. As many people as we want.

626
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:50,740
Oh my God.

627
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:57,080
Not only will you get
enough to pass for university,

628
00:55:57,580 --> 00:55:59,720
but we can also get more money
from other clients.

629
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:03,950
After deducting the costs,
we'll split the profits.

630
00:56:06,190 --> 00:56:07,720
Is it too risky?

631
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:10,790
What risk?
It's not risky at all.

632
00:56:10,990 --> 00:56:11,960
Who is this?

633
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:13,730
This is Mentor Lynn.

634
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:15,660
This is the only way

635
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,430
that I can earn enough
money to go study with you

636
00:56:18,530 --> 00:56:20,170
without asking anyone.

637
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:25,170
Oh, I forgot to mention...

638
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,580
I'm going to Boston
with you guys.

639
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:33,980
Going together will
be so much fun!

640
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:41,320
The job for you two is
just to find clients for us.

641
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:44,190
As for the exam,
I'll take care of it.

642
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:45,290
Wait.

643
00:56:45,890 --> 00:56:48,400
Before we go looking
for clients,

644
00:56:48,730 --> 00:56:50,830
Now that I understand this
time zone thing,

645
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,830
but I'm still confused as to

646
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:55,100
how the hell are you
gonna give us the answers?

647
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:57,070
Write them down?

648
00:56:58,210 --> 00:56:59,270
Memorize them.

649
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:04,050
The best way is to memorise it.

650
00:57:04,450 --> 00:57:05,780
It's the safest way

651
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:07,180
and it leaves no trail.

652
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,750
Sorry. Are you part of the X-Men?

653
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:13,420
The STIC has over 100 questions.

654
00:57:13,490 --> 00:57:15,160
Are you gonna remember all that?

655
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:16,430
I can.

656
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:18,690
If there's enough time.

657
00:57:20,030 --> 00:57:22,060
The problem now is that
after I finish the test...

658
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,570
there's only so much time.

659
00:57:23,830 --> 00:57:27,100
The most I can remember
half of all the answers.

660
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,370
Only half?

661
00:57:30,770 --> 00:57:32,570
There's only one person
who can help.

662
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:34,910
But he wouldn't do it.

663
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:44,750
What's up, Mom?

664
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:46,460
I'm done.

665
00:57:50,690 --> 00:57:51,990
Mr.s. Rut's house?

666
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:55,560
Can it be another day?

667
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:59,840
Tomorrow... I have the
scholarship exam at 8:00 a.m.

668
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:02,940
Hmm, yeah.

669
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:11,080
Hey, you!

670
00:58:11,150 --> 00:58:13,080
Your basket grazed by mirror!

671
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:14,550
If you said sorry--

672
00:59:09,810 --> 00:59:11,610
250,000 for a passing score...

673
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:13,280
that's not expensive for you, right?

674
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,640
The tutoring fee for the STIC
is way more expensive.

675
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:19,480
We'll need approximately 30 clients.

676
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:20,950
If more than this,
it will be risky.

677
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:23,420
Anything less, it won't be worth it.

678
00:59:24,990 --> 00:59:28,520
I've got almost 30 people
in my STIC group chat.

679
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:31,590
If you can get them to join,

680
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:33,730
you'll get 5,000 baht
discount per head

681
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:35,660
from your full payment.

682
00:59:36,130 --> 00:59:37,430
But wait a minute.

683
00:59:38,530 --> 00:59:41,300
You must make sure no one
else knows about this.

684
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:44,040
Especially, that loser Bank.

685
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:46,780
Don't mind that dumbass.

686
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:48,880
He won't say shit.

687
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:49,880
Why?

688
00:59:50,410 --> 00:59:51,280
Didn't you hear?

689
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:56,320
That dumbass picked a fight in
the wrong neighborhood.

690
00:59:56,590 --> 00:59:58,050
He's beaten up pretty badly.

691
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:09,200
The best part is...

692
01:00:09,530 --> 01:00:11,530
he didn't make it to
the scholarship exam.

693
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:25,210
Seminar:
To Becoming Number One in Education - 2B COME WON

694
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:28,920
I believe that everyone here

695
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:30,850
wants to pass the STIC

696
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:34,420
for a brighter future you are hoping for.

697
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:37,190
Shit, it's Steve Pat.

698
01:00:37,490 --> 01:00:42,300
I have a way for us all to
get satisfactory scores.

699
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:45,030
The only things you're
allowed in the exam room

700
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:46,840
is a 2B pencil,

701
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:47,900
eraser,

702
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,070
exam ID,

703
01:00:51,110 --> 01:00:52,440
and passport.

704
01:00:53,110 --> 01:00:56,410
Communication devices
are definitely not allowed.

705
01:00:56,750 --> 01:01:01,320
So the phone that I will be using
to send the answers back to Thailand,

706
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:03,620
will be hidden inside the
toilet tank in the washroom.

707
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:07,490
I'll try and send the answers
in between the breaks.

708
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,090
The exam is split into 3 parts,

709
01:01:10,390 --> 01:01:11,630
with 2 breaks.

710
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:13,730
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

711
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:16,460
How will the clients
use the answers in the exam?

712
01:01:16,530 --> 01:01:18,370
Not everyone can
remember like you.

713
01:01:23,870 --> 01:01:24,840
Barcode.

714
01:01:29,580 --> 01:01:33,320
Everyone will receive a 2B pencil
with a barcode stuck on it.

715
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:35,980
The different widths
of the barcode

716
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:37,490
will represent the
answer choices.

717
01:01:37,590 --> 01:01:40,090
Starting from the left to right.

718
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:43,090
The thickest is A,

719
01:01:43,290 --> 01:01:45,730
then B, C, and D.

720
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:48,130
Sounds cool, huh?

721
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:49,660
But there's more.

722
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:51,400
The 4 pencils

723
01:01:51,530 --> 01:01:54,600
will represent the answers
for the 4 section.

724
01:01:56,440 --> 01:02:00,610
And the numbers next to the barcode
are for grid-in questions.

725
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:03,280
For the essay part,

726
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:05,580
they usually use
published articles.

727
01:02:06,210 --> 01:02:08,580
I'll send you the
keywords and you can Google them.

728
01:02:08,650 --> 01:02:10,120
Hey, it's mine.

729
01:02:10,190 --> 01:02:11,420
It fell.

730
01:02:11,650 --> 01:02:15,620
Hey, I'm saying for the essay.
You'll have to write them yourselves.

731
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:18,960
In short, on the exam day,

732
01:02:19,090 --> 01:02:22,830
everyone will leave the meeting
point before 7:30 a.m.

733
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:25,370
to arrive at the exam
centres on time.

734
01:02:25,430 --> 01:02:27,870
We will provide
motortaxis for you

735
01:02:27,940 --> 01:02:30,570
to take you to the exam centres.

736
01:02:30,670 --> 01:02:32,270
Finally...

737
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:36,480
everyone will have to pay
in cash within the next 2 weeks.

738
01:02:36,650 --> 01:02:39,780
Otherwise, the deal is off.

739
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:44,790
I'd also like to emphasize that

740
01:02:45,650 --> 01:02:49,690
what we are doing here
is highly confidential.

741
01:02:51,190 --> 01:02:52,630
Any questions?

742
01:02:55,460 --> 01:02:56,400
If there aren't...

743
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:58,670
I will end the seminar now.

744
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:03,200
We will become one,

745
01:03:03,470 --> 01:03:05,740
to be number one in education in education.

746
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:09,140
We'll get the scores needed to
get in any universities.

747
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:12,210
We choose the university,

748
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:15,080
the universities don't get to choose us!

749
01:03:30,170 --> 01:03:32,630
Whoa. That's rough, "Little Bank".

750
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:47,820
What's up?

751
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:50,990
I'm sorry.

752
01:03:51,490 --> 01:03:53,320
That you missed out on
the scholarship.

753
01:03:59,590 --> 01:04:00,530
Same.

754
01:04:03,530 --> 01:04:05,030
On that day...

755
01:04:05,830 --> 01:04:07,500
I really didn't mean to.

756
01:04:09,670 --> 01:04:11,910
I don't know if you
meant it or not.

757
01:04:12,170 --> 01:04:13,480
What I do know is that you

758
01:04:13,710 --> 01:04:16,380
are also responsible
for what happened to me.

759
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:23,920
I have a proposition for you.

760
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:25,790
What is it?

761
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:27,320
Taking an exam.

762
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:34,700
Taking an exam or cheating an exam?

763
01:04:35,030 --> 01:04:36,870
To me the word "cheat"

764
01:04:37,030 --> 01:04:39,070
implies someone doesn't benefit.

765
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:43,370
But we will get money, and the
others will get good scores.

766
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:44,440
It's a win-win.

767
01:04:51,710 --> 01:04:52,580
Bank.

768
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:56,480
To be honest,
we're both are losers here.

769
01:04:57,490 --> 01:04:59,750
We're not born to win
like Pat or Grace.

770
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:04,330
We must try harder
to get what's ours.

771
01:05:05,890 --> 01:05:07,060
Look, what happened to you?

772
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:08,300
It's not the same.

773
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:10,400
You cheated.

774
01:05:11,630 --> 01:05:12,870
I was just unlucky.

775
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:17,470
True.

776
01:05:18,670 --> 01:05:20,910
But don't you see? Even
if you don't cheat...

777
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:23,780
life cheats you anyways.

778
01:05:30,620 --> 01:05:31,650
This is Grace's address.

779
01:05:31,790 --> 01:05:33,460
I'll see you tomorrow if
you're interested.

780
01:05:46,170 --> 01:05:48,870
<font color="#006400">Honest Commerce Printing"</font>

781
01:05:48,940 --> 01:05:50,870
<font color="#FF8C00">Honest Commerce Printing</font>

782
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:23,870
Sit here, please.

783
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:28,280
Aren't you gonna take a seat?

784
01:06:39,820 --> 01:06:41,460
Here is what's gonna happen

785
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:43,120
First...

786
01:06:43,830 --> 01:06:47,160
we'll fly to Sydney and
take the STIC together.

787
01:06:57,570 --> 01:06:58,610
Hey, Lynn.

788
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:01,910
You're missing a document.

789
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:03,710
Dad.

790
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:05,880
You remember that
show, Teen Genius?

791
01:07:06,050 --> 01:07:07,620
They want me to
compete in Sydney.

792
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:20,800
They need your bank statement
for visa purposes.

793
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:22,060
Who are you going with?

794
01:07:22,530 --> 01:07:23,530
With Bank.

795
01:07:24,730 --> 01:07:25,830
Huh?

796
01:07:26,570 --> 01:07:29,070
It's not just the two of
us, there's a teacher too.

797
01:07:32,710 --> 01:07:33,640
Second...

798
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:34,940
You and I

799
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:37,250
will have to memorise
the answers, half each.

800
01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:38,450
Don't forget...

801
01:07:38,550 --> 01:07:39,550
Bank memorizes the first half,

802
01:07:39,610 --> 01:07:40,950
and Lynn memorizes the second half.

803
01:07:41,550 --> 01:07:43,420
Section 1 has 52 questions.

804
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:44,650
Start!

805
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:49,290
<b>SECTION 1</b>
<b>52 Questions</b>

806
01:07:49,420 --> 01:07:51,290
<b>SECTION 2</b>
<b>44 Questions</b>

807
01:07:51,390 --> 01:07:53,330
<b>SECTION 3</b>
<b>16 Grid-in Questions</b>

808
01:07:53,390 --> 01:07:54,630
As for the last section,

809
01:07:55,030 --> 01:07:59,200
you need to leave the exam early to
send the essay question in time.

810
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:03,000
Time's up for section 4.
Start the essay.

811
01:08:04,270 --> 01:08:06,980
Memorising the question and key words
shouldn't be a problem for you.

812
01:08:07,210 --> 01:08:11,080
But the hard part is they
won't let you leave early.

813
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:14,620
To avoid any suspicion,

814
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:16,620
you have to act sick.

815
01:08:18,090 --> 01:08:18,950
Sure.

816
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:21,160
I can throw up.

817
01:08:30,730 --> 01:08:32,070
Do I have to puke now?

818
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:33,330
No!

819
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:41,740
How much am I getting?

820
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:48,950
1 million.

821
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:03,900
What about you guys?

822
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:07,400
2 million.

823
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:13,940
What do you say, Bank?

824
01:09:14,410 --> 01:09:16,210
Everything is in your hands.

825
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:22,750
Okay.

826
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:29,190
We got it!

827
01:09:29,620 --> 01:09:30,190
Right on time.

828
01:09:30,290 --> 01:09:31,290
Yes!

829
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:35,560
You should've just said yes
from the beginner. Such a poser.

830
01:09:54,450 --> 01:09:55,480
Hey, guys!

831
01:09:58,690 --> 01:10:00,290
See you tomorrow at 1:00 p.m.

832
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:02,420
1:00 p.m., my ass.

833
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:04,090
The flight's at 11:00 p.m.

834
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:05,530
What's the rush?

835
01:10:05,830 --> 01:10:08,400
There is one more thing
we need to rehearse.

836
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:17,370
Please stop.

837
01:10:17,740 --> 01:10:21,910
You just can't keep on
grilling the weakling!

838
01:10:24,580 --> 01:10:26,450
You must be enjoying...

839
01:10:26,650 --> 01:10:30,790
seeing innocents
cry like this.

840
01:10:40,830 --> 01:10:42,530
That's too much, Pat.
Way too much.

841
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:45,700
I've used up all my cards.

842
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:47,840
You guys are acting as if
we are really getting caught.

843
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:49,940
I told you I understand...

844
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:52,540
if you get caught,
we'll blame only you.

845
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:56,410
Last question before
heading to the airport.

846
01:10:56,540 --> 01:10:57,610
Last question.

847
01:11:01,050 --> 01:11:02,420
In character.

848
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:03,580
Ready?

849
01:11:06,590 --> 01:11:08,320
What if Bank gets caught?

850
01:11:08,860 --> 01:11:10,190
What will you say?

851
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:15,700
That's even more far-fetched.

852
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:17,430
I've never been friends with him.

853
01:11:17,530 --> 01:11:19,630
I've seen him around
school for 4-5 years.

854
01:11:19,730 --> 01:11:21,370
I've never seen
him with any friends.

855
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:23,670
He looks like ass.

856
01:11:23,740 --> 01:11:24,940
And he's a weirdo.

857
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:30,880
Outside of school, he even got
beaten up and dumped in a landfill.

858
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:38,290
Are we done?

859
01:11:40,790 --> 01:11:42,620
Stop!

860
01:11:43,620 --> 01:11:44,590
Bank, stop!

861
01:11:44,890 --> 01:11:45,890
Stop!

862
01:11:46,530 --> 01:11:47,830
I said stop!

863
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:50,360
Fucker!

864
01:11:51,170 --> 01:11:52,170
Bank!

865
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:04,810
What the hell is wrong with you?

866
01:12:07,820 --> 01:12:10,350
You're the one who
told me to say this.

867
01:12:10,650 --> 01:12:12,420
So, why are you mad at me?

868
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:15,460
Pat, stop.

869
01:12:15,690 --> 01:12:16,590
Bank...

870
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:18,090
Bank, that's enough.

871
01:12:20,860 --> 01:12:21,700
Why?

872
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:22,460
Why?

873
01:12:22,530 --> 01:12:23,300
I...

874
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:24,030
You what?!

875
01:12:24,130 --> 01:12:25,430
never...

876
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:28,670
told anyone that I
woke up in a landfill!

877
01:12:32,410 --> 01:12:34,210
Now you know what I'm mad about!

878
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:39,110
All of you set me up, right?

879
01:12:40,550 --> 01:12:42,920
You guys set me up so I
wouldn't get the scholarship, right?

880
01:12:44,090 --> 01:12:45,990
You were all in it, right?

881
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:48,590
You guys knew, right?

882
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:50,790
You knew, right?

883
01:12:52,330 --> 01:12:53,660
You knew, right?

884
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:56,460
Why the fuck aren't you answering?

885
01:12:58,430 --> 01:12:59,630
Bank, Bank, Bank, Bank, Bank.

886
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:00,740
Calm down, Bank.

887
01:13:00,870 --> 01:13:02,570
I don't want to fucking
hear what you have to say!

888
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:06,770
Bank, stop! Let's talk this out.
Let's talk this out. Let's talk this out.

889
01:13:10,650 --> 01:13:12,880
Calm down. Calm down.

890
01:13:13,110 --> 01:13:14,150
Okay?

891
01:13:15,180 --> 01:13:17,750
I'm sorry, Bank.

892
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:19,790
I'm sorry.

893
01:13:20,590 --> 01:13:22,290
I didn't think they'd
be so rough on you.

894
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:24,290
Bank, hear me out.

895
01:13:24,490 --> 01:13:26,290
You're still taking
the STIC, right?

896
01:13:27,530 --> 01:13:29,130
Fuck the STIC!

897
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:31,400
Bank, Bank, Bank, Bank, Bank.
Listen to me.

898
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:32,870
You listen to me!

899
01:13:33,170 --> 01:13:35,870
I only have my mom.

900
01:13:35,940 --> 01:13:37,610
She's like a hunchback,
doing laundry.

901
01:13:37,710 --> 01:13:38,410
You--

902
01:13:38,470 --> 01:13:39,870
I'm not rich like you.

903
01:13:40,140 --> 01:13:42,740
That scholarship was my dream.

904
01:13:43,110 --> 01:13:46,050
The dream for my mom
to live comfortably.

905
01:13:46,110 --> 01:13:47,580
And then you came.

906
01:13:48,050 --> 01:13:49,120
Bank...

907
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:51,850
If I don't pass the STIC,
my dad will kill me.

908
01:13:52,190 --> 01:13:53,190
Please, Bank.

909
01:13:53,290 --> 01:13:54,320
Please.

910
01:13:57,660 --> 01:13:59,790
I win, you win.
It's a win-win for the both of us.

911
01:14:02,030 --> 01:14:04,730
Bank, I beg of you.

912
01:14:04,830 --> 01:14:05,930
Then...

913
01:14:06,670 --> 01:14:09,100
You should send those thugs to
beat up your dad!

914
01:14:12,570 --> 01:14:14,540
Why do you say shit like that?!

915
01:14:20,950 --> 01:14:23,750
Didn't you tell me
that you needed him?

916
01:14:25,420 --> 01:14:26,820
And if I didn't play dirty,

917
01:14:27,090 --> 01:14:28,990
do you think he'd help you out?

918
01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:03,660
Lynn!

919
01:15:04,790 --> 01:15:06,530
Wait, let's talk about this.

920
01:15:07,030 --> 01:15:08,560
Were you in on this?

921
01:15:11,830 --> 01:15:13,130
I really didn't know.

922
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:17,040
Please try to understand Pat.

923
01:15:17,540 --> 01:15:20,110
He did it because he wanted
to help with your plan.

924
01:15:20,210 --> 01:15:24,110
Without considering
who would get hurt?

925
01:15:30,450 --> 01:15:34,460
<font color="#1E90FF">The Future of Laundry</font>

926
01:15:37,730 --> 01:15:39,390
Grace, refund the money.

927
01:15:39,490 --> 01:15:40,490
I'm out.

928
01:15:41,130 --> 01:15:42,500
Wait, Lynn.

929
01:15:43,860 --> 01:15:44,900
Calm down.

930
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,670
Okay, I respect your decision.

931
01:15:47,740 --> 01:15:48,700
If you're out, I'm out.

932
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:50,040
No more clients, okay?

933
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:52,670
It'll just be the 3 of us,
like we originally planned.

934
01:15:52,940 --> 01:15:54,710
Don't you understand?

935
01:15:55,210 --> 01:15:57,210
I said I'm out.

936
01:16:04,490 --> 01:16:05,650
Okay.

937
01:16:05,850 --> 01:16:08,090
I guess that's it.

938
01:16:12,090 --> 01:16:13,530
I just have one request,

939
01:16:13,630 --> 01:16:15,630
Don't be mad at me.

940
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:21,440
If I had half your brain,

941
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:23,970
I wouldn't do something
this stupid.

942
01:16:24,110 --> 01:16:25,110
Please.

943
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:50,530
Flight leaves in 3 hours.

944
01:16:50,630 --> 01:16:51,700
Let's get going, Lynn.

945
01:16:56,670 --> 01:16:57,670
Bank.

946
01:17:09,580 --> 01:17:10,850
I'll go through with it.

947
01:17:14,020 --> 01:17:15,460
At least there's money in it.

948
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:18,960
I won't get beaten up for free.

949
01:17:20,730 --> 01:17:22,160
What if I told you that...

950
01:17:22,530 --> 01:17:23,900
I don't wanna do it anymore.

951
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:29,000
I'm not asking you.

952
01:17:30,540 --> 01:17:32,540
The only reason I'm here
is because of you.

953
01:17:32,970 --> 01:17:35,140
The only reason I ended up in a
landfill is because of you.

954
01:17:35,780 --> 01:17:38,110
The only reason all of this
shit is happening is because of you.

955
01:17:39,580 --> 01:17:42,620
Don't you think you're also responsible?

956
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:15,950
<b>SYDNEY</b>

957
01:18:34,670 --> 01:18:36,540
Here's your phone.

958
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:46,210
Lynn.

959
01:18:46,550 --> 01:18:47,550
Hmm?

960
01:18:49,620 --> 01:18:50,680
I'm sorry.

961
01:18:51,820 --> 01:18:52,950
Sorry for what?

962
01:18:53,620 --> 01:18:54,660
Well...

963
01:18:57,660 --> 01:18:58,830
Your nose.

964
01:19:05,670 --> 01:19:06,530
Hmm.

965
01:19:13,870 --> 01:19:14,840
You know...

966
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:23,780
I've never been abroad before.

967
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:41,000
From tomorrow onwards,

968
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:44,070
we can go anywhere we want to.

969
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:58,750
Come on, let's take a selfie.

970
01:20:05,890 --> 01:20:07,360
<b><font color="#B22222">FINAL TEST</font></b>

971
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:20,040
This year, the STIC test is cancelled
in the many countries across Asia.

972
01:20:20,110 --> 01:20:21,910
Such as China and Korea.

973
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:24,610
This is because the
College Board has acknowledged

974
01:20:24,710 --> 01:20:27,750
<i>the STIC question were
leak prior to the test date.</i>

975
01:20:28,050 --> 01:20:32,420
<i>This year the College Board has to
increase security procedures for the test.</i>

976
01:20:32,490 --> 01:20:34,150
<i>To ensure no more problems.</i>

977
01:20:59,750 --> 01:21:01,080
All applicants.

01:27:32,540 --> 01:27:33,770
I can't calm down!

1017

Can you hear me?

1038
01:31:14,860 --> 01:31:16,400
Step outside, I said.

Now!

1040
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:22,540
Someone has reported to us that
you are in there for too long.

01:33:07,270 --> 01:33:08,370
Look at me.

1051
01:33:08,910 --> 01:33:11,480
I'll give you a chance to
tell me everything!

01:33:15,550 --> 01:33:17,450
What did you do?

1053
01:33:20,850 --> 01:33:22,460
What did you do?

1054

Speak to me!

1055
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:28,730
This doesn't have anything to do with you.
Go back to your test.

1056
01:34:20,980 --> 01:34:23,450
You may start section 4 now!

01:37:23,500 --> 01:37:25,500
Don't we need to leave
here before 7:30 a.m.?

1060
01:37:25,570 --> 01:37:26,500
Yeah!

1061
01:37:26,930 --> 01:37:30,470
It's 7 a.m., you're not paying enough!

1062
01:37:30,570 --> 01:37:31,870
I've already paid you everything.

1063

Essay section starts now!

1064
01:38:56,660 --> 01:38:58,360
What's wrong? Are you okay?

1065
01:38:58,520 --> 01:38:59,660
Are you okay?

1066
01:39:00,860 --> 01:39:01,690
Come on. Are you okay?

1067
01:39:01,790 --> 01:39:03,700
I feel sick. Can we go home now?

1068
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:05,870
If you leave now, your exam
score will be cancelled.

1069
01:39:05,930 --> 01:39:06,900
Do you understand?

1070
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,030
Wait!

1071
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:12,370
It's 7 a.m., why haven't
they sent the rest of the answers?!

1072
01:39:12,440 --> 01:39:13,440
How do I know--

1073
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:28,990
Hello.

1074
01:39:41,730 --> 01:39:42,870
Is Lynn here?

1075
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,400
I can't get in touch with her.

1076
01:39:45,670 --> 01:39:46,910
I haven't seen her.

1077
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:51,810
She told me she went to
Sydney for a competition.

1078
01:39:52,450 --> 01:39:53,410
Oh yeah.

1079
01:39:54,050 --> 01:39:56,750
No wonder why we haven't seen her.

1080
01:39:56,980 --> 01:39:58,550
I'm sure she'll
bring back a medal.

1081
01:40:00,020 --> 01:40:02,320
But I found the
permission letter at home.

1082
01:40:02,620 --> 01:40:04,320
I called, but no one answered.

1083
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:25,910
So, I came to the address on the sheet.

1084
01:40:43,630 --> 01:40:46,000
Can someone tell me what
Lynn is doing in Sydney?

1085
01:40:57,140 --> 01:40:57,980
Huh?!

1086
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:05,650
Roger that. I can't see her.

1087
01:41:06,650 --> 01:41:08,350
<i>Okay, okay, I'm
looking. Checking.</i>

1088
01:41:11,020 --> 01:41:12,530
<i>Yup. She's not here mate.</i>

1089
01:41:13,190 --> 01:41:15,660
Keep looking. I'm coming up.

1090
01:41:27,570 --> 01:41:28,640
Did you find her?

1091
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:39,320
<i>I'm out.</i>

1092
01:41:54,330 --> 01:41:56,840
If you don't answer me,
I'll go straight to the Headmistress.

1093
01:42:32,170 --> 01:42:34,640
Tell me, what are guys you up to again?!

1094
01:42:34,770 --> 01:42:35,640
Huh?!

1095
01:42:47,350 --> 01:42:48,590
Lynn and Bank are dating!

1096
01:42:49,960 --> 01:42:51,520
They went on a secret trip.

1097
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:03,940
Lynn was afraid you
wouldn't let her go.

1098
01:43:04,040 --> 01:43:05,200
So, she lied.

1099
01:43:05,470 --> 01:43:07,570
I really didn't know
how to stop her.

1100
01:43:08,270 --> 01:43:13,910
I think it's best you talk to
your daughter, sir.

1101
01:43:19,350 --> 01:43:20,020
Okay.

1102
01:43:35,670 --> 01:43:36,870
C'mon!

1103
01:43:43,940 --> 01:43:44,980
Sir,

1104
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:47,380
Love is a beautiful thing.

1105
01:44:11,700 --> 01:44:12,910
What's the matter?

1106
01:44:13,540 --> 01:44:14,840
It's 7 a.m. already.

1107
01:44:14,910 --> 01:44:15,910
The motortaxis are leaving.

1108
01:44:15,980 --> 01:44:17,640
They're saying we passed the agreed time.

1109
01:44:17,740 --> 01:44:19,410
You explain to them what's going on

1110
01:44:19,480 --> 01:44:21,250
Because I don't know a damn thing!

1111
01:44:21,310 --> 01:44:22,980
I'll talk to them.

1112
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:25,550
What's with your leg?

1113
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:27,690
It's almost 7:30.

1114
01:44:27,790 --> 01:44:29,420
Where at the barcodes?

1115
01:44:29,490 --> 01:44:30,520
I already paid the money.

1116
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:32,120
What's the wait? What's the wait?

1117
01:44:41,530 --> 01:44:42,600
You'll get there in time!

1118
01:44:42,700 --> 01:44:43,970
- I promise.
- Pat!

1119
01:45:08,890 --> 01:45:10,830
Pat! We're out of stickers.

1120
01:45:19,670 --> 01:45:20,640
Here you go. 500 each.

1121
01:45:20,740 --> 01:45:22,410
We'll leave soon. We'll leave soon.

1122
01:45:43,630 --> 01:45:44,530
Shit!

1123
01:45:46,530 --> 01:45:49,400
(IN ENGLISH) Hey! Can you open the door?! Can
you open the door, please?!

1124
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:52,570
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1125
01:46:35,480 --> 01:46:36,680
It's almost 7:30 a.m., Grace!

1126
01:46:36,780 --> 01:46:37,680
Do we have all the answers?!

1127
01:46:37,780 --> 01:46:39,450
No! 6 left.

1128
01:46:42,720 --> 01:46:44,620
- Why it does say EDGE?
- Huh?

1129
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:46,290
It says EDGE!

1130
01:46:46,390 --> 01:46:47,360
What's EDGE?!

1131
01:46:47,460 --> 01:46:49,060
There's no reception.

1132
01:47:00,240 --> 01:47:01,470
What happens if
we don't make it?

1133
01:47:01,610 --> 01:47:03,140
And the money we paid?

1134
01:47:03,780 --> 01:47:05,040
We won't make it!

1135
01:47:05,110 --> 01:47:06,680
If we don't make it, we want our refund!

1136
01:47:10,980 --> 01:47:11,980
C'mon.

1137
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:13,350
Did you get it, yet?

01:48:01,100 --> 01:48:01,930
D

1142
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:15,310
These 3 go to the
Bangkapi exam center.

1143
01:48:15,410 --> 01:48:17,280
These 2 rows to Suttisarn.

1144
01:48:17,350 --> 01:48:18,680
Did you get on, yet?

1145
01:48:19,050 --> 01:48:20,520
You didn't put your helmet on, put it on!

1146
01:48:21,650 --> 01:48:22,960
One set each, pass it on.

1147
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:24,520
One set each!

1148
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:26,090
We're ready!

1149
01:48:26,160 --> 01:48:27,460
Hurry up!

1150
01:48:27,690 --> 01:48:29,400
Wear your helmet!

1151
01:48:32,400 --> 01:48:33,230
Hey!

1152
01:48:50,420 --> 01:48:51,580
Are you okay?

1153
01:48:52,820 --> 01:48:54,420
(IN ENGLISH) No. I'm sick.

1154
01:48:54,490 --> 01:48:56,420
This doesn't matter.

1155
01:48:56,660 --> 01:48:58,990
You have to come back to
the test center with me.

1156
01:48:59,090 --> 01:48:59,830
Now!

1157
01:48:59,890 --> 01:49:00,730
Now!

1158
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:22,920
I'm from the embassy.

1159
01:49:23,080 --> 01:49:25,450
A Thai student confessed to using
his phone as a dictionary.

1160
01:49:25,550 --> 01:49:26,850
We're resolving the situation.

1161
01:49:27,350 --> 01:49:28,790
(IN THAI) What will happen to him?

1162
01:49:28,920 --> 01:49:31,460
They'll probably
cancel his scores.

1163
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:34,360
Worst case, he'll be banned
from the STIC forever.

1164
01:49:34,690 --> 01:49:38,530
As for you, they'll be questioning you.
If there isn't anything else, you may leave.

1165
01:49:39,500 --> 01:49:40,500
Just wait here.

1166
01:49:40,570 --> 01:49:41,830
I'll go talk to them.

1167
01:50:26,450 --> 01:50:27,310
Hold on.

1168
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:32,320
What's the matter?

1169
01:50:53,240 --> 01:50:54,040
Huh?

1170
01:50:59,310 --> 01:51:00,880
May I use the toilet?

1171
01:51:00,950 --> 01:51:01,880
Of course.

1172
01:51:31,610 --> 01:51:32,540
Lynn!

1173
01:51:32,610 --> 01:51:34,480
Welcome back. Welcome back.

1174
01:51:35,110 --> 01:51:36,480
Mentor Lynn's FC here!

1175
01:51:39,150 --> 01:51:40,350
Thanks so much, Lynn.

1176
01:51:43,590 --> 01:51:45,990
We're celebrating at my house tonight.

1177
01:51:46,090 --> 01:51:47,230
Celebrate what?

1178
01:51:48,030 --> 01:51:49,490
Did you know that Bank got caught?

1179
01:51:50,300 --> 01:51:52,630
And my scores were cancelled, Pat.

1180
01:51:56,540 --> 01:51:57,840
Well...

1181
01:51:57,940 --> 01:52:00,340
we'll look for another
exam centre for you.

1182
01:52:00,940 --> 01:52:02,570
If you don't retake the exam,

1183
01:52:02,640 --> 01:52:05,140
you won't be able to apply
to university in time.

1184
01:52:07,610 --> 01:52:08,950
Hey, Lynn.

1185
01:52:09,050 --> 01:52:10,850
You have to retake the exam.

1186
01:52:11,150 --> 01:52:13,120
Pretty please?

1187
01:52:15,850 --> 01:52:17,220
I've changed my mind.

1188
01:52:18,490 --> 01:52:20,390
You've already got the
scores you needed.

1189
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:26,370
But,

1190
01:52:26,430 --> 01:52:28,830
we can't go without you!

1191
01:52:33,770 --> 01:52:35,470
You do know, right?

1192
01:52:36,540 --> 01:52:39,650
That university exams aren't
multiple choices anymore.

1193
01:52:42,250 --> 01:52:44,350
Even if I went with you,

1194
01:52:44,650 --> 01:52:46,620
you wouldn't be able to copy me anyways.

1195
01:52:52,360 --> 01:52:53,530
I'll get back on my own.

1196
01:53:26,160 --> 01:53:27,490
Where's your boyfriend?

1197
01:53:30,860 --> 01:53:31,730
Where is he?

1198
01:53:37,040 --> 01:53:38,540
I wanted to invite him for dinner.

1199
01:53:44,740 --> 01:53:45,610
Where is he, huh?

1200
01:53:48,780 --> 01:53:50,550
Why didn't you tell me about him?

1201
01:53:57,520 --> 01:53:59,590
- Dad!
- Huh?

1202
01:54:02,560 --> 01:54:04,560
I have a confession to make.

1203
01:54:05,430 --> 01:54:06,430
What is it, honey?

1204
01:54:09,700 --> 01:54:10,670
What is it?

1205
01:54:24,150 --> 01:54:27,150
Why do you choose
to study in Education?

1206
01:54:28,090 --> 01:54:29,690
I want like to be a teacher, 
like my father.

1207
01:54:29,790 --> 01:54:32,460
So, I can use my knowledge
in the best way.

1208
01:54:33,560 --> 01:54:40,170
Do you have experience in tutoring
or have you taught anyone before?

1209
01:54:42,370 --> 01:54:43,370
Yes, I have.

1210
01:54:58,620 --> 01:55:01,420
I scored <font color="#FF0000">1,460 points</font> on STIC

1211
01:55:01,490 --> 01:55:05,120
Being a teacher isn't
just about being good acedemically.

1212
01:55:06,090 --> 01:55:07,460
Do you think...

1213
01:55:07,560 --> 01:55:10,730
you can be a good example
in other things as well?

1214
01:55:22,910 --> 01:55:25,040
[Lynn. When are you coming?]
[Bank's taken his share, come get yours]

1215
01:55:25,110 --> 01:55:26,680
[Come quick, we already miss you]

1216
01:55:26,780 --> 01:55:28,410
I'm not going to lie.

1217
01:55:29,310 --> 01:55:32,320
I've done a lot a bad
things in the past.

1218
01:55:32,820 --> 01:55:33,820
But I will use them

1219
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:35,920
to teach myself and others.

1220
01:55:37,790 --> 01:55:40,290
[Lynn left the chat]

1221
01:55:59,610 --> 01:56:01,550
It is such a waste,

1222
01:56:02,550 --> 01:56:05,320
To be honest, with
your knowledge and abilities,

1223
01:56:06,250 --> 01:56:09,520
You can apply for scholarships
to study abroad easily.

1224
01:56:10,090 --> 01:56:12,320
Aren't you interested
in any of them?

1225
01:56:13,960 --> 01:56:15,390
I think...

1226
01:56:16,330 --> 01:56:18,930
there's someone else who
deserves it more than me.

1227
01:56:23,240 --> 01:56:29,640
Student Expulsion Letter:
Thanaphon Viriyakul

1228
01:57:14,950 --> 01:57:17,460
Bank:
[Meet me at my place tonight.]

1229
01:58:01,930 --> 01:58:02,830
Come in.

1230
01:58:09,540 --> 01:58:11,640
The store looks
fresh, Little Bank.

1231
01:58:12,140 --> 01:58:13,810
Oh wait, it's Mister Bank now.

1232
01:58:14,550 --> 01:58:15,610
You laundering money?

1233
01:58:17,550 --> 01:58:19,420
You were expelled from
school because

1234
01:58:19,480 --> 01:58:21,850
the embassy reported you, right?

1235
01:58:23,820 --> 01:58:24,660
Hmm.

1236
01:58:27,160 --> 01:58:28,490
What's next?

1237
01:58:30,530 --> 01:58:32,360
That's the reason why
I asked you over.

1238
01:58:35,330 --> 01:58:37,400
Did you apply for
the GAT/PAT exams?

1239
01:58:39,570 --> 01:58:41,610
I have a proposition for you.

1240
01:58:46,110 --> 01:58:49,780
I have a fool-proof plan.
Much safer.

1241
01:58:49,880 --> 01:58:51,550
We can get the answers
out to more people.

1242
01:58:52,150 --> 01:58:56,620
More importantly, there're more
GAT/PAT clients than STIC clients.

1243
01:58:57,620 --> 01:58:58,620
But this plan...

1244
01:59:02,230 --> 01:59:04,160
can't be done without Mentor Lynn.

1245
01:59:27,690 --> 01:59:29,020
How much more of this do you need?

1246
01:59:29,990 --> 01:59:31,890
If your cut wasn't enough...

1247
01:59:33,560 --> 01:59:35,290
my cut is still with Pat.

1248
01:59:35,360 --> 01:59:36,460
You can go get it.

1249
01:59:42,170 --> 01:59:42,830
No.

1250
01:59:43,030 --> 01:59:43,900
Wait.

1251
01:59:46,540 --> 01:59:48,240
It's not about how much money we got.

1252
01:59:49,740 --> 01:59:50,980
It's about,

1253
01:59:51,580 --> 01:59:52,610
from now on,

1254
01:59:53,680 --> 01:59:55,380
how much more we can make.

1255
01:59:57,420 --> 01:59:58,250
Lynn.

1256
02:00:00,090 --> 02:00:01,790
From my calculations.

1257
02:00:03,390 --> 02:00:04,390
This round...

1258
02:00:05,660 --> 02:00:07,160
there's at least
10 million in it.

1259
02:00:08,060 --> 02:00:11,630
Don't you think it's
worth the risk again?

1260
02:00:13,800 --> 02:00:15,000
You were there.

1261
02:00:15,230 --> 02:00:18,570
Even if we get caught,
it doesn't mean we go to jail.

1262
02:00:23,240 --> 02:00:24,380
To be honest, Lynn.

1263
02:00:25,080 --> 02:00:26,910
Why would you endure
studying for 4 years

1264
02:00:26,980 --> 02:00:28,680
for a 5 figure salary?

1265
02:00:29,150 --> 02:00:31,950
When you can earn millions right now.

1266
02:00:33,050 --> 02:00:35,520
Why work a stupid desk job?

1267
02:00:46,330 --> 02:00:47,870
That's probably because for me,

1268
02:00:48,430 --> 02:00:50,340
no amount of money is worth it.

1269
02:00:59,880 --> 02:01:00,680
Lynn.

1270
02:01:02,750 --> 02:01:04,250
If you don't do this...

1271
02:01:06,250 --> 02:01:07,920
I'll tell everyone that

1272
02:01:07,990 --> 02:01:09,620
you're the mastermind
behind the STIC scandal.

1273
02:01:10,160 --> 02:01:10,960
I guarantee you.

1274
02:01:11,020 --> 02:01:13,560
You'll be banned from
studying abroad just like me.

1275
02:01:21,230 --> 02:01:24,340
Fine. We're even then.

1276
02:01:27,410 --> 02:01:29,070
It won't just be you!

1277
02:01:29,370 --> 02:01:30,240
This includes Grace,

1278
02:01:30,380 --> 02:01:31,280
Pat,

1279
02:01:31,540 --> 02:01:33,880
and all the clients who
took the STIC too.

1280
02:01:34,880 --> 02:01:35,950
Think about it...

1281
02:01:36,110 --> 02:01:37,350
if the board finds out,

1282
02:01:37,480 --> 02:01:39,550
they might even cancel all the
scores in Thailand.

1283
02:01:52,700 --> 02:01:53,900
One last thing, Lynn.

1284
02:01:56,170 --> 02:01:58,240
Your dad will be so
disappointed in you.

1285
02:02:00,540 --> 02:02:01,610
Don't be afraid, honey.

1286
02:02:04,540 --> 02:02:06,440
We'll get through
this, no matter what.

1287
02:02:08,050 --> 02:02:09,550
Smile.

1288
02:02:10,950 --> 02:02:12,780
Smile with me.

1289
02:02:29,170 --> 02:02:30,270
Ms. Rinrada?

1290
02:02:30,370 --> 02:02:31,970
<i>You once told me...</i>

1291
02:02:33,770 --> 02:02:35,410
if we win, we win together.

1292
02:02:36,140 --> 02:02:38,240
If we lose, we lose together.

1293
02:02:40,040 --> 02:02:42,150
I won't be the only one
taking all the blame.

1294
02:02:43,410 --> 02:02:44,550
If you won't do it,

1295
02:02:44,950 --> 02:02:47,150
I'll make sure you go down with me!

1296
02:02:54,960 --> 02:02:55,990
What do you say, Lynn?

1297
02:02:59,530 --> 02:03:00,830
What's it going to be?

1298
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:04,340
Everything is up to you now.

1299
02:03:11,440 --> 02:03:13,810
You're right.
Everything <i>is</i> up to me.

1300
02:03:42,570 --> 02:03:44,640
We are here to record your confession

1301
02:03:44,740 --> 02:03:47,880
to the suspected cheating on the STIC test.

1302
02:03:48,780 --> 02:03:51,050
