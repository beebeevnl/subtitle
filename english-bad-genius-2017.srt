Now, let's talk about the STIC test

3
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:00,120
or Standardised Test for
International Colleges,

4
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,290
which tests for general
knowledge and

5
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,820
it is used to apply to bachelor
programmes in the U.S.

6
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,460
This year the association
overseeing the examination

7
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:11,660
has uncovered a
cheating scandal,

8
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,470
which has led to the exam leaking in
in various countries in Asia.

9
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:19,740
Further investigation
is pending...

10
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:34,890
That's not mine.

11
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,990
My name is Rinrada Nilthep.

12
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,790
I'm in Grade 12, class 3

13
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,830
at Krungthep Thaweepanya School.

14
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,400
You can call to check
my school records.

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,540
The STIC exam isn't
beyond my ability.

16
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:26,200
<b>BAD GENIUS</b>

17
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,940
Student Portfolio:
Ms. Rinrada Nilthep

18
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,440
This student has achieved a 4.00 GPA
in Grade 7, Academic Year 2011

19
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,710
<b>GRADE 9</b>

20
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,650
Straight A's since Grade 1.

21
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,820
Honour student since
Grade 7 to Grade 9.

22
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,590
Came in first place in the school
district's Maths Competition.

23
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:48,630
National Crossword Champion.

24
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,430
There's also achievements in sports...

25
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,960
this one is...

26
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,200
For swimming.

27
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:54,630
That's fine, Vit.

28
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:56,570
This is more than enough.

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,340
No need to ask whether we
would accept Lynn or not.

30
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:03,310
The important question is...

31
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,080
do you want to study here?

32
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,480
What do you say, honey?

33
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:15,650
I don't have to
decide now, right?

34
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,460
It's not that I don't
want to study here.

35
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,860
It's just that my old school
is more suitable for me.

36
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,800
If I move here, my dad

37
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,200
will have to pay 150,000 per year.

38
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,040
How is it 150,000?

39
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,500
One semester is only 60,000,

40
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:35,840
so it only comes up to 120,000.

41
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:43,080
Correct. However, my dad
taught at my old school,

42
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,720
So I can go with him to
school every morning.

43
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,650
If I study here, I'd have
to take the skytrain

44
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:52,190
including calling motortaxis from the
station to home is 80 baht everyday...

45
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,630
for 8 months, which is 170 days,

46
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,230
excluding holidays.

47
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:01,870
It's approximately
13,600 baht per year.

48
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,540
There's also lunch,

49
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:07,710
At my old school it only
costs 20 baht for 2 sides with rice.

50
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,410
Here it's 35 baht.

51
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:13,680
I'll also have to buy new
school supplies and uniforms.

52
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,750
I think all in all...

53
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,980
it might not be worth it.

54
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,730
Gold medal in maths.

55
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,730
Honey...

56
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,100
I can afford it.

57
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,330
No, you can't.

58
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,030
What if we let you study for free?

59
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:46,480
Vit, I'll add free
lunch as well, okay?

60
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,950
We want want to see that
we value geniuses like Lynn.

61
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,280
Is it worth it now?

62
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:56,490
Worth it.

63
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,790
Worth bringing all this.

64
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,860
It's worth it, right?

65
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,400
Letter of Authorisation

66
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,530

68
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,540
Alright, done.

69
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,610
One second!

70
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,780
This ID is gonna be
with us for 3 years.

71
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,980
You gotta look good.

72
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:28,620
Okay?

73
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:34,930
You just moved here, right?

74
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,290
I'm Grace.

75
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:37,490
I'm Lynn.

76
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:43,570
What are you doing?

77
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:44,940
Can I have a look?

78
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,500
Take off your glasses.

79
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,540
Trust me.

80
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,410
Wow!

81
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:55,350
Pretty!

82
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,380
Smile. C'mon.

83
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:01,590
Okay. Ready 1... 2.

84
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,120
Go.

85
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,060
You're next. Quickly.

86
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:18,500
Grace

87
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:30,750
My ID number is after hers, so
we sat next to each other for 3 years.

88
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,750
Actually, Lynn and I are really close.

89
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,550
But everyone says Lynn's a genius.
But I'm...

90
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,360
I'm good at extracurricular
activities.

91
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,030
Sometimes, people might
even call me stupid.

92
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:52,200
The Headmistress came
up with a new policy this semester.

93
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,980
To be in a school play, you
need at least a 3.25 GPA.

94
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:02,110
Why? Am I too stupid
to be in a school play?

95
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,880
I think...

96
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,890
acting is harder than studying.

97
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,090
Really?

98
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,320
Really.

99
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:19,300
Look, I've been tutoring
with Mr. Sophon for weeks,

100
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,170
but I still don't know shit.

101
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:24,370
And maths really pulls
my grades down.

102
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,040
The answer is C.

103
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,010
What! You got the answer
just by glancing?

104
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:31,980
Upside down, too!

105
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,680
It's super easy.

106
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:42,290
"A union B, intersect with C."
Do the one's in the parentheses first,

107
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,960
then "intersect with C"
is just whatever's left in C.

108
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,290
That's the answer.

109
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,730
Oh! I get it.

110
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,200
Scholarship kids really are smart.

111
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,170
Another one?

112
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,380
Lynn, will you be my tutor?

113
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:09,650
Why not?

114
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,450
If you teach me,

115
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,420
I'll buy you a milkshake
after school every day.

116
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,290
Nah.

117
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,320
You'll get to review the
lesson every evening.

118
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,620
Not enough.

119
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:22,790
What about...

120
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,660
If you agree,

121
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,070
I'll get to be your first
student, Mentor Lynn.

122
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,410
Mentor Lynn.

123
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,540
Mentor Lynn.

124
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:42,410
Mentor Lynn!

125
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:43,950
That got me.

126
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,320
I'll teach you all
of this today.

127
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,550
Grace told you I helped
with her studies?

128
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,660
That's right.

129
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:57,460
But tutoring my friend
isn't wrong, right?

130
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,330
<b>MIDTERMS</b>

131
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,170

been waiting for.

132
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,370
Pass the test paper.

133
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,210
That's enough. Take a deep
breath, clear your mind.

134
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,210
It's already crystal clear.

135
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,120

start the exam.

<i>If you know you don't understand</i>

140
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,400
and you still didn't
come tutor with me then.

141
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,010
Don't come to me now.

142
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,710
It's too late.

143
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,820
Grace.

144
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,420
The paper is exactly
the same as Mr. Sophon's sheets!

145
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,650
- Yeah!
- You can do it, right?

146
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:31,660
No.

147
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,320
Why not? I already taught you!

148
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,630
I can't remember.

149
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,400
What are you talking about?

150
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,730
No talking, no cheating!

151
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:44,670

misconduct in my exam room.

Of course!

157
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,130

158
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,500

Sure. Where?

165
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,620
Let's got to Pat's then.

166
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,580
It's convenient.

167
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,290
You have a swimsuit, right?

168
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,540
Pat, will it kill you to
just get in pool like a normal person?

169
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,840
Nope...

170
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,110
but it's not cool.

171
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,370
I got water in my ear.

172
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,580
Mr. Pat, dinner is served.

173
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,840
Just leave it.

Are you coral watching, Grace?

177
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,510
To be honest, I've told Grace to invite
you over to my place a bunch of times.

178
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,840
We're all in the same class,
but we hardly ever talk.

179
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:19,840
But Grace though,

180
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,710
always Lynn this... Lynn that.

181
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:22,910
Shut up.

182
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,410
Are you jealous?

183
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,490
Grace says that you're
good at everything.

184
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:31,560
Without you, her grades
wouldn't have improved.

185
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,490
I even told her that...

186
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,130
I want to have a
friend like you.

187
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:40,360
I've seen you with
a bunch of friends.

188
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:41,630
You're right,

189
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:46,540
but no one lends me their
eraser during exams.

190
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,110
Why?

191
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:01,550
Why? You want to be in
the school play as well?

192
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:04,550
Smart people like you
don't understand.

193
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,460
Idiots like me,

194
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,160
we all want good grades.

195
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:10,690
Damn.

196
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,330
Hey, babe!

197
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,030
Dad said if I don't fail this semester
he'll will get me a new car.

198
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,400
Sounds good?

199
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:26,610
I know that we aren't tight...

200
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,410
but if you agree...

201
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,980
I'll pay you 3,000 per subject.

202
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,550
This is per person.

203
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,890
Per person?

204
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:37,920
Yeah.

205
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:40,590
What do you mean?

206
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:42,030
I've got 5 more friends.

207
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:45,360
What if the teachers find out?

208
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,360
Don't worry about that.

209
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,470
All my friends can be trusted.

210
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:52,570
And all my friends are willing to pay.

211
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:56,440
Think about it, this
is only one subject.

212
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:00,410
And each semester has...
how many subjects, Grace?

213
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,880
Not including PE...

214
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:02,910
13, right?

215
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,450
So each semester,
you'll get...

216
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,680
13 times...

217
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,620
234,000 baht.

218
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,520
Nice digits as well: 234,000.

219
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,330
In exchange for your brains.

220
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,500
Tick-tock.

221
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:25,170
Call it even for the
school's 'tea money'.

222
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,570
What tea money?

223
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,610
Seriously?

224
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,270
You really don't know?

225
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,440
Everyone pays.

226
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,980
The stupider you are,
the more you pay.

227
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,050
I paid 400,000.

228
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:41,050
And this dumbass donated 20
iMac's to the library.

229
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,790
But I got a scholarship.

230
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,060
The scholarship is for studying.

231
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,460
Don't forget about
the maintenance fees.

232
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:08,110
Receipt:
New Student Fee - 200,000 baht

233
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:28,500
Divorce Papers

234
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,030
What mood are you in?

235
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:05,670
You know, I was going to sell
it to buy a new car.

236
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,700
Since you never play it anymore.

237
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:14,640
I just remembered yesterday
was Mom's birthday.

238
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:25,160
Why were you so eager to
make me move to this school?

239
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,190
Most students from this school

240
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:31,160
get scholarships
to study abroad.

241
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,800
I wanted to give you
opportunities your old school couldn't offer.

242
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,540
I'm not like Mom, you know.

243
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:40,900
Have you ever thought that

244
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,440
I might be happier
at my old school?

245
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,550
Three points.

246
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:55,190
Don't be too loud and disturb
the neighbors. Eat dinner.

247
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,620
I'm going to bed.

248
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:06,420
Okay, I admit I paid Lynn.

249
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,730
But paying her for
piano lessons...

250
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:13,530
isn't against any laws, right?

251
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,130
Or is it?

252
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,540
Will you send me to
international court?

253
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:23,210
Have you ever heard
that classical music

254
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,540
helps with the
brain's development?

255
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,440
We'll use 4 songs
to represent

256
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:31,920
A, B, C and D.

257
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,290
Memorize my right hand movements.

258
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,690
This is A.

259
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:46,630
Remember that it starts with the pinky
and finishes with the thumb.

260
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:49,870
This is B.

261
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:53,670
B is 4 3 2 1 3, repeated twice.

262
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,040
This is C.

263
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:03,150
This one D.

264
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:06,420
I'll give you 3
answers and skip 1.

265
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,920
I'll repeat this pattern.

266
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,950
So that the scores are scattered.

267
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:12,990
This'll keep the marks in check,
and not alert any teachers.

268
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:15,930
You must complete every question
that is the multiple of 4.

269
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:24,030
I'll start giving the
answers at 9:15 a.m.

270
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,840
Meanwhile, complete the
remaining questions.

271
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,860
D.

272
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:17,450
Lynn.

273
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,590
This shirt is expensive.

274
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,290
Are you getting rich from
teaching piano?

275
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:26,360
You can wear new
clothes too, you know.

276
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,200
They tease you at school
that you're a scrooge.

277
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:32,800
I wouldn't mind a new
pair of trousers too.

278
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,740
"Classical Piano Lessons
by Mentor Lynn"

279
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:44,280
More people want to
join your piano class.

280
00:23:52,790 --> 00:24:01,030
Congratulations to Scholarship
Students, Academic Year 2013

281
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:10,510
<b>GRADE 11</b>

282
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:17,450
Bank

283
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:27,090
Stay tuned for Teen Genius
after the break!

284
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,400
It's true that Lynn and I study at
the same school.

285
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,540
But we're not friends.

286
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,600
Actually, we're rivalries.

287
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,110
What's wrong, Bank?
Are you nervous?

288
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:47,680
Uh-huh.

289
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,210
Did you have noodles for lunch?

290
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,150
How'd you know?

291
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,550
You've got some on your shirt.

292
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,090
Dirty and wrinkled.

293
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:06,160
Here. A wet wipe.

294
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,630
For your shirt.

295
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:16,110
Hey! If we win we'd get 5,000 baht!

296
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:19,980
We'll actually get
less than that.

297
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:22,780
With 3% tax deduction:
which is 150.

298
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,150
So it's only 4,850
or 2,425 each.

299
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,680
It's still a lot.

300
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,490
It's enough for a salmon buffet.

301
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:35,690
If we win, you wanna
go this evening?

302
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,700
No.

303
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:45,370
I don't like eating outside.

304
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,440
It's a waste of money.

305
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,010
What are you laughing at?

306
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:52,610
Nothing. You sound
just like my dad.

307
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,280
Is that good or bad?

308
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,150
Of course, It's a good thing.

309
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:00,420
Messy hair, wrinkled
shirt. Exactly like him.

310
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,520
What? I'm just gonna
fix your hair.

311
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:11,290
We're going on TV, the least
you can do is look good.

312
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,070
Looking handsome.

313
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:24,970
Ready?

314
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,380
Hmm.

315
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,650
<i>Final question.</i>

316
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:43,730
<i>Tell me the Pi value with as many
decimal places as possible.</i>

317
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:47,100
3.141592653589793...

318
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,400
That's enough, that's enough!

319
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:52,200
And the winner of this
week's Teen Genius is...

320
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,870
Krungthep Thaweepanya School!

321
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:02,550
I'm really awestruck. How did
divide the Pi value so quickly?

322
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:06,480
I didn't divide it.
I just memorized it.

323
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,050
You memorized the value of Pi?

324
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:14,660
I used to play memory
games with my dad.

325
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,660
Pi's value, names of
people, and reservoir names.

326
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:22,900
Brilliant, this is why you're
our scholarship student.

327
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:24,530
Have a seat.

328
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,940
I didn't ask you to come
only to praise you.

329
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:32,410
I also have good news for you.

330
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,650
Next year, the Singaporean Embassy
is offering scholarships for Thai students.

331
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,450
No strings attached.
It's a full scholarship.

332
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:44,090
You can study a bachelors and
finish with a doctorate.

333
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:47,460
Considering your grades,
behaviour and determination,

334
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:53,160
There's only you two who are
the school's best representatives.

335
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:56,800
There's a catch though.

336
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:02,610
Each school can only send one
student for the scholarship.

337
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:04,670
But that shouldn't
be a problem, right?

338
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:08,480
Yesterday, you two
were teammates.

339
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:12,480
But from now on, you're now rivals.
Isn't this fun?

340
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:37,410
Little Bank Laundry Service

341
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,140
The washing machine broke again.

342
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,850
I can't finish the
laundry in time.

343
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:59,530
Don't worry. I'll
take care of it.

344
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,730
Your hands are all calloused.

345
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:20,050
It's understandable
if you think I cheated...

346
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,620
but thinking that Bank
would cheat too?

347
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,490
Aside from my father,

348
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,360
Bank is the only other honest
and hard-working person

349
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,700
I've ever known in my entire life.

350
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:37,830
Hey, Bank!

351
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,440
What's up, Tong?

352
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,100
Did you finish studying for the exam?

353
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:45,210
Me too, man.

354
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,680
I was sick and didn't
finish studying.

355
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,240
Exactly the same,

356
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,280
Go finish studying.

357
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,880
Dude, please help me!

358
00:29:58,650 --> 00:29:59,820
Let me copy you.

359
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:05,190
I really can't fail this time.

360
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,130
I've tried...

361
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,830
but this piano code is
just too hard for me.

362
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,200
What piano code?

363
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,340
Oh-- No--
It's nothing.

364
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:20,680
Hey, I won't copy you for free.

365
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,050
I'll pay you.

366
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,380
3,000 baht, enough?

367
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:31,350
Letting me copy
won't lower your marks.

368
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,990
Wait! Listen to me!

369
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:35,960
Bank!

370
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:37,090
Bank!

371
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:38,190
Bank!

372
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,460
Bank!

373
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:42,630
Damn it, Bank! Can't
you help a friend?

374
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,730
You're goddamn heartless!

375
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,200
Hurry, hurry.

376
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:19,540
Today you're all taking
the test together.

377
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,540
Don't sit next to
your classmates.

378
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:38,290
All right, you may
start your test.

379
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:43,730
Grade 11, class 1

380
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:44,460
Grade 11, class 4

381
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:45,730
Grade 11, class 3

382
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:46,460
Grade 11, class 6

383
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:07,080
40. Your exam paper is set 1.

384
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:15,860
Sir, how do we
answer question 40?

385
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:17,690
There are two sets
of test papers.

386
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:20,600
Just answer according
to the one you have.

387
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:31,840
A. Set 1

388
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:33,110
B. Set 2

389
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:26,130
Be careful of Tong copying.

390
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:40,940
Lynn! Which set did you get?

391
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,420
So, which set?

392
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,490
Set 1.

393
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,830
Leave set 1 here.

394
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,170
What?

395
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,170
Row 3.

396
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:08,740
Banjong.

397
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,510
Crew cut with glasses.

398
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:14,610
He's copying Rinrada, she's
sitting next to him.

399
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:19,920
I'll take care of it.

400
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:20,820
Don't worry.

401
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,080
You can go.

402
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:26,590
What now?

403
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:34,330
30 minutes left.

404
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,000
A. Set 1

405
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,560
Tong.

406
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,660
Huh?

407
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,130
Switch the papers.

408
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:18,200
Now!

409
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,000
Banjong Wongpoom

410
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:26,680
20 minutes left.

411
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:31,810
Lynn. Lynn.

412
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:32,650
What?!

413
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:35,080
Should I erase your name
and write mine instead?

414
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:36,820
No! Just sit still.

415
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:59,370
10 minutes left.

416
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,700
Last 5 minutes.

417
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,180
B. Set 2

418
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:06,680
Time's up.

419
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,750
Stop writing!

420
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,760
Hey!

421
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:22,620
Put your pencils down!

422
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,700
That's enough!

423
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,750
Don't you already have enough A's?
That's it!

424
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,450
[Jeez, the teacher's playing hardball.]

425
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:26,560
[That was close. Thank you, Mentor Lynn]

426
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,000
Is it worth it?
Being this risky.

427
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:38,330
Well, it is 3,000 for 25 per person.

428
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,130
What do you think?

429
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,340
Rinrada!

430
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:45,870
You didn't write your
name on the scrap paper.

431
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:52,450
Rinrada, Grade 11, class 3

432
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:54,250
and Banjong Grade 11, class 1,

433
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:56,950
report to the Headmistress's
office immediately.

434
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,290
I assure you.

435
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,590
If you don't believe me, then
have Tong retake the test.

436
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,390
You'll know the truth.

437
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:12,730
I've called the
both of you in...

438
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,410
because Thanaphon said
there's been some cheating.

439
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:22,040
There are 2 sets of test papers.
There's no point of cheating.

440
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:41,460
I'm giving you a chance
to tell the truth.

441
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:43,900
Banjong, did you cheat?

442
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,610
We'll find out soon enough.

443
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:58,450
Thanaphon and Rinrada,
you're excused.

444
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,420
Banjong, you stay here.

445
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:11,990
Lynn, don't leave yet.

446
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:19,130
How did you do these problems
on your scrap paper?

447
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:23,210
Since these problems are
not on the set you got.

448
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:42,820
Please don't get caught us.

449
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,530
Don't worry about it,

450
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:51,330
The Headmistress probably wants
to discuss about the scholar--

451
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:05,710
We have evidence that

452
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:07,880
Lynn completed her
friend's paper.

453
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:12,420
Lynn.

454
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:15,590
Explain why you did it.

455
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:18,860
If you don't, then
I will expel you.

456
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:22,860
For the money.

457
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,500
Tong tried to hire
me to do his test.

458
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:31,940
3,000 baht.

459
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:38,550
I'm very disappointed in you.

460
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:40,750
Vit...

461
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,980
I accepted your
daughter because

462
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:45,550
she's an honor student.

463
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:48,420
But it's not just about
being an good student,

464
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,190
it's also about having good disipline.

465
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:54,400
You're a teacher, you
should understand.

466
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,730
Completing your friend's
exam paper is cheating.

467
00:42:56,830 --> 00:42:58,930
It's a gross violation
of school policy.

468
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,370
To be honest,
I could expel you right now.

469
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:06,740
Seeing that this
is your first time,

470
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:09,980
I'll just cancel
your scholarship.

471
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:19,150
Yes, ma'am.

472
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:27,500
To be honest, having Tong and Lynn
retake the test should be enough...

473
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:32,400
Remember Lynn.

474
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:35,670
School is a place for studying,

475
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,770
not a place for making money.

476
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:40,680
What are you laughing at?

477
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:43,080
Where are your manners?

478
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,210
Nothing.

479
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:45,210
Mr. Pravit,

480
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,780
you're a teacher, didn't
you teach her manners?

481
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:52,990
Sorry.

482
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:56,990
I don't think I'm the only one

483
00:43:57,130 --> 00:43:58,990
who uses the school
to make money.

484
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:03,300
What do you mean?

485
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:06,570
I'm talking about the
'tea money' that my dad paid.

486
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,540
It's not called 'tea money'.

487
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:14,210
It's the school maintenance fee.

488
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:18,280
Isn't school maintenance fee
included in the tuition fee?

489
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:19,580
Stop, Lynn!
That's enough.

490
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:30,030
Please let her study here.

491
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:32,230
I'll take care of the
remaining tuition.

492
00:44:32,330 --> 00:44:33,330
Let's go.

493
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,400
Fine.

494
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:38,130
I have one condition.

495
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:43,510
You're banned from the
Singapore Scholarship.

496
00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:55,820
Okay, okay.

497
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:56,950
Let's go.

498
00:44:57,290 --> 00:44:58,750
What's the scholarship
have to do with it?

499
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:01,120
It's true that I let
my friend copy me,

500
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:03,020
but I've never copied anyone.

501
00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:07,800
All the grades that I've gotten
reflect my actual abilities.

502
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:10,630
These abilities,
other students have them too.

503
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:14,000
There's also people who deserve
this scholarship like Thanaphon.

504
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,910
If you can't accept
this condition,

505
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:19,670
then you can resign.

506
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,110
All right, Mr. Pravit?

507
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:26,380
Yes, ma'am.

508
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:27,920
Let's go, Lynn.

509
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:34,420
Good luck with the scholarship.

510
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:51,940
Well, if you found evidence...

511
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:55,480
I guess Lynn really did cheat.

512
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:00,550
But I have nothing
to do with it.

513
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:05,320
Being an honor student
doesn't mean...

514
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:08,090
we have the same behaviour.

515
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,630
Ms. Rinrada Nilthep

516
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:15,660
I knew it.

517
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:18,370
I knew you didn't do it just for 3,000 baht.

518
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:22,840
Piano lessons?

519
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:32,780
Did you ever think that it'd
actually be better to actually tutor them?

520
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:36,450
But the Headmistress
cheated us first.

521
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:40,190
How can you call it cheating,
when I paid willingly.

522
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:41,190
My friends also paid willingly!

523
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:43,330
Can't you see you did wrong?!

524
00:46:58,370 --> 00:46:59,410
Ok.

525
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:01,140
I'll take the blame.

526
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:04,780
It's my fault.

527
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:07,450
Who am I to blame?

528
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:13,190
If I can't raise my daughter
to be a good person,

529
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:17,160
then why should I go ask for
scholarships for my daughter?

530
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:29,100
I'll sell the car to pay for
the rest of the tuition fee.

531
00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:33,170
As for this shirt...

532
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:37,550
I don't want it anymore.

533
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:42,750
About going abroad,
just forget it!

534
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,320
You're not going anywhere.

535
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:47,420
You're staying here with me.

536
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,130
Return all the money to your
friends by the end of the semester.

537
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:15,780
You can think that
Lynn is a bad person,

538
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,420
but to me...

539
00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:20,860
she's truly a good friend.

540
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:31,700
Sorry for being such a crybaby,

541
00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:34,670
but I'm not just acting.

542
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:43,880
<b>GRADE 12</b>

543
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:54,920
So? Does it look refreshing?

544
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:57,160
Not bad.

545
00:48:58,030 --> 00:48:59,730
I'm casting is tomorrow.

546
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:01,830
You didn't call me just
for this, right?

547
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,040
How are you guys getting along?

548
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:11,540
You can take care of yourselves
for last two semesters, right?

549
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:17,780
Pat and I have other
things to worry about.

550
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:24,050
<i>Has Pat told you, yet?</i>

551
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:26,190
We just got back from France.

552
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:28,820
The trip was so fun!

553
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:31,030
Yeah, 'cause you left your son behind.

554
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:33,630
Well, I've got to go shopping too.

555
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:36,130
- Mom.
- I got you something too.

556
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:37,730
- Pat.
- Yes?

557
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:39,730
Go fetch a red wine
in the cellar for me.

558
00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:42,340
Why don't you ask
the housekeeper to do it?

559
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:50,910
Yes, sir.

560
00:49:58,790 --> 00:50:01,020
Grace, would you like
any more dessert?

561
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:02,290
No, thank you.

562
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:05,960
We invited you over today

563
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:08,160
because we would
like to thank you.

564
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:10,370
Thank me for what?

565
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:13,540
For helping Pat
with his studies.

566
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,100
You have no idea...

567
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:18,910
how disappointed we've
been over his grades.

568
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:22,210
But ever since Pat's
been seeing you,

569
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:25,080
he's like a totally
different person.

570
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:32,050
I think you're better than
all those famous tutors.

571
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:40,030
To be honest, we've
been planning this for some time.

572
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:44,730
We wanted Pat to study at the
same university as I did, at Boston.

573
00:50:45,870 --> 00:50:49,540
But looking at his previous grades...

574
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,340
I knew he wouldn't make it.

575
00:50:52,770 --> 00:50:55,040
So, I thought that...

576
00:50:56,540 --> 00:50:57,910
you should go with him.

577
00:50:58,310 --> 00:50:59,780
So you can help him study there.

578
00:51:01,550 --> 00:51:02,650
Sounds good, right?

579
00:51:14,630 --> 00:51:16,970
Don't worry about the expenses.

580
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:20,030
Share the living expenses with Pat.

581
00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:22,670
As for tuition fees...

582
00:51:24,070 --> 00:51:25,870
if you need any help...

583
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:29,780
you can let us know. Anytime.

584
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:34,080
I've some information
for you already.

585
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:36,120
You can take a look at it.

586
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:44,490
If money isn't an issue,
say yes, all right?

587
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:56,540
You know of the
STIC test, right?

588
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:00,540
It's like GAT/PAT, used to
apply to American universities.

589
00:52:00,610 --> 00:52:02,580
It's the same test
at the same time, worldwide.

590
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,610
I need to take the STIC...

591
00:52:05,110 --> 00:52:07,550
and I need to take
it within this year.

592
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:10,450
If not...

593
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:14,160
I won't be able to apply
to the university in time.

594
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:23,060
I've already been
busted once, Grace.

595
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:31,770
I'm not comfortable
asking you for help either

596
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:35,110
but we really don't
know what to do.

597
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:40,480
But Pat said he'll pay
you 600,000 baht.

598
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:28,200
Could you return this to Pat?

599
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:29,500
Yes, alright.

600
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,300
Could I borrow a pen
and some paper as well?

601
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:42,140
"I really can't help you guys this time. Sorry!!"

602
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:44,750
Miss.

603
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:58,960
- Hi baby, I'm so glad that you called.
- Hi dad.

604
00:54:00,530 --> 00:54:03,300
It's so bright there.
What time is it?

605
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:04,830
It's noon, dad.

606
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,640
I hope you have a lot
of fun in Thailand!

607
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:11,710
Can you see what's time
it is here? Can you see?

608
00:54:11,770 --> 00:54:13,210
Why it's so dark there?

609
00:54:13,270 --> 00:54:14,610
It's nap time here.

610
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:17,480
Okay. I've got to check in.

611
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,450
Okay. Can I call you back later?

612
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:21,550
Good night.

613
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:22,680
Bye-bye.

614
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,370
Time zones.

615
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:20,610
The STIC is taken at the same
time and date worldwide.

616
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:24,950
This means countries here will take
the test earlier than the rest.

617
00:55:27,550 --> 00:55:28,750
Simply,

618
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:30,590
If you two take it in Thailand

619
00:55:30,650 --> 00:55:33,650
while I fly over and take
the test somewhere earlier.

620
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:35,790
Like Sydney, Australia.

621
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:37,460
4 hours ahead of Thailand.

622
00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:39,990
I will get to see
the exam first.

623
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:41,960
Complete it first.

624
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,900
And send you guys the answers,

625
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,800
along with the others taking the test in
Thailand. As many people as we want.

626
00:55:48,870 --> 00:55:51,740
Oh my God.

627
00:55:52,570 --> 00:55:58,080
Not only will you get
enough to pass for university,

628
00:55:58,580 --> 00:56:00,720
but we can also get more money
from other clients.

629
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:04,950
After deducting the costs,
we'll split the profits.

630
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:08,720
Is it too risky?

631
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:11,790
What risk?
It's not risky at all.

632
00:56:11,990 --> 00:56:12,960
Who is this?

633
00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:14,730
This is Mentor Lynn.

634
00:56:15,130 --> 00:56:16,660
This is the only way

635
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,430
that I can earn enough
money to go study with you

636
00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:21,170
without asking anyone.

637
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:26,170
Oh, I forgot to mention...

638
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:29,580
I'm going to Boston
with you guys.

639
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:34,980
Going together will
be so much fun!

640
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:42,320
The job for you two is
just to find clients for us.

641
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:45,190
As for the exam,
I'll take care of it.

642
00:56:45,330 --> 00:56:46,290
Wait.

643
00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:49,400
Before we go looking
for clients,

644
00:56:49,730 --> 00:56:51,830
Now that I understand this
time zone thing,

645
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:53,830
but I'm still confused as to

646
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:56,100
how the hell are you
gonna give us the answers?

647
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,070
Write them down?

648
00:56:59,210 --> 00:57:00,270
Memorize them.

649
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,050
The best way is to memorise it.

650
00:57:05,450 --> 00:57:06,780
It's the safest way

651
00:57:06,950 --> 00:57:08,180
and it leaves no trail.

652
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:11,750
Sorry. Are you part of the X-Men?

653
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:14,420
The STIC has over 100 questions.

654
00:57:14,490 --> 00:57:16,160
Are you gonna remember all that?

655
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:17,430
I can.

656
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:19,690
If there's enough time.

657
00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:23,060
The problem now is that
after I finish the test...

658
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:24,570
there's only so much time.

659
00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:28,100
The most I can remember
half of all the answers.

660
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,370
Only half?

661
00:57:31,770 --> 00:57:33,570
There's only one person
who can help.

662
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:35,910
But he wouldn't do it.

663
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:45,750
What's up, Mom?

664
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:47,460
I'm done.

665
00:57:51,690 --> 00:57:52,990
Mr.s. Rut's house?

666
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:56,560
Can it be another day?

667
00:57:56,660 --> 00:58:00,840
Tomorrow... I have the
scholarship exam at 8:00 a.m.

668
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:03,940
Hmm, yeah.

669
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:12,080
Hey, you!

670
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:14,080
Your basket grazed by mirror!

671
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:15,550
If you said sorry--

672
00:59:10,810 --> 00:59:12,610
250,000 for a passing score...

673
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,280
that's not expensive for you, right?

674
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:16,640
The tutoring fee for the STIC
is way more expensive.

675
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:20,480
We'll need approximately 30 clients.

676
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:21,950
If more than this,
it will be risky.

677
00:59:22,050 --> 00:59:24,420
Anything less, it won't be worth it.

678
00:59:25,990 --> 00:59:29,520
I've got almost 30 people
in my STIC group chat.

679
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,590
If you can get them to join,

680
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:34,730
you'll get 5,000 baht
discount per head

681
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:36,660
from your full payment.

682
00:59:37,130 --> 00:59:38,430
But wait a minute.

683
00:59:39,530 --> 00:59:42,300
You must make sure no one
else knows about this.

684
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:45,040
Especially, that loser Bank.

685
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:47,780
Don't mind that dumbass.

686
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:49,880
He won't say shit.

687
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:50,880
Why?

688
00:59:51,410 --> 00:59:52,280
Didn't you hear?

689
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:57,320
That dumbass picked a fight in
the wrong neighborhood.

690
00:59:57,590 --> 00:59:59,050
He's beaten up pretty badly.

691
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:10,200
The best part is...

692
01:00:10,530 --> 01:00:12,530
he didn't make it to
the scholarship exam.

693
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:26,210
Seminar:
To Becoming Number One in Education - 2B COME WON

694
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:29,920
I believe that everyone here

695
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:31,850
wants to pass the STIC

696
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:35,420
for a brighter future you are hoping for.

697
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:38,190
Shit, it's Steve Pat.

698
01:00:38,490 --> 01:00:43,300
I have a way for us all to
get satisfactory scores.

699
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:46,030
The only things you're
allowed in the exam room

700
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:47,840
is a 2B pencil,

701
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:48,900
eraser,

702
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,070
exam ID,

703
01:00:52,110 --> 01:00:53,440
and passport.

704
01:00:54,110 --> 01:00:57,410
Communication devices
are definitely not allowed.

705
01:00:57,750 --> 01:01:02,320
So the phone that I will be using
to send the answers back to Thailand,

706
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:04,620
will be hidden inside the
toilet tank in the washroom.

707
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:08,490
I'll try and send the answers
in between the breaks.

708
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:11,090
The exam is split into 3 parts,

709
01:01:11,390 --> 01:01:12,630
with 2 breaks.

710
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:14,730
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

711
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:17,460
How will the clients
use the answers in the exam?

712
01:01:17,530 --> 01:01:19,370
Not everyone can
remember like you.

713
01:01:24,870 --> 01:01:25,840
Barcode.

714
01:01:30,580 --> 01:01:34,320
Everyone will receive a 2B pencil
with a barcode stuck on it.

715
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,980
The different widths
of the barcode

716
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:38,490
will represent the
answer choices.

717
01:01:38,590 --> 01:01:41,090
Starting from the left to right.

718
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:44,090
The thickest is A,

719
01:01:44,290 --> 01:01:46,730
then B, C, and D.

720
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,130
Sounds cool, huh?

721
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:50,660
But there's more.

722
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,400
The 4 pencils

723
01:01:52,530 --> 01:01:55,600
will represent the answers
for the 4 section.

724
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:01,610
And the numbers next to the barcode
are for grid-in questions.

725
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:04,280
For the essay part,

726
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:06,580
they usually use
published articles.

727
01:02:07,210 --> 01:02:09,580
I'll send you the
keywords and you can Google them.

728
01:02:09,650 --> 01:02:11,120
Hey, it's mine.

729
01:02:11,190 --> 01:02:12,420
It fell.

730
01:02:12,650 --> 01:02:16,620
Hey, I'm saying for the essay.
You'll have to write them yourselves.

731
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,960
In short, on the exam day,

732
01:02:20,090 --> 01:02:23,830
everyone will leave the meeting
point before 7:30 a.m.

733
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:26,370
to arrive at the exam
centres on time.

734
01:02:26,430 --> 01:02:28,870
We will provide
motortaxis for you

735
01:02:28,940 --> 01:02:31,570
to take you to the exam centres.

736
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:33,270
Finally...

737
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:37,480
everyone will have to pay
in cash within the next 2 weeks.

738
01:02:37,650 --> 01:02:40,780
Otherwise, the deal is off.

739
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:45,790
I'd also like to emphasize that

740
01:02:46,650 --> 01:02:50,690
what we are doing here
is highly confidential.

741
01:02:52,190 --> 01:02:53,630
Any questions?

742
01:02:56,460 --> 01:02:57,400
If there aren't...

743
01:02:57,900 --> 01:02:59,670
I will end the seminar now.

744
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:04,200
We will become one,

745
01:03:04,470 --> 01:03:06,740
to be number one in education in education.

746
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:10,140
We'll get the scores needed to
get in any universities.

747
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:13,210
We choose the university,

748
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:16,080
the universities don't get to choose us!

749
01:03:31,170 --> 01:03:33,630
Whoa. That's rough, "Little Bank".

750
01:03:47,950 --> 01:03:48,820
What's up?

751
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:51,990
I'm sorry.

752
01:03:52,490 --> 01:03:54,320
That you missed out on
the scholarship.

753
01:04:00,590 --> 01:04:01,530
Same.

754
01:04:04,530 --> 01:04:06,030
On that day...

755
01:04:06,830 --> 01:04:08,500
I really didn't mean to.

756
01:04:10,670 --> 01:04:12,910
I don't know if you
meant it or not.

757
01:04:13,170 --> 01:04:14,480
What I do know is that you

758
01:04:14,710 --> 01:04:17,380
are also responsible
for what happened to me.

759
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:24,920
I have a proposition for you.

760
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:26,790
What is it?

761
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:28,320
Taking an exam.

762
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:35,700
Taking an exam or cheating an exam?

763
01:04:36,030 --> 01:04:37,870
To me the word "cheat"

764
01:04:38,030 --> 01:04:40,070
implies someone doesn't benefit.

765
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:44,370
But we will get money, and the
others will get good scores.

766
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:45,440
It's a win-win.

767
01:04:52,710 --> 01:04:53,580
Bank.

768
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:57,480
To be honest,
we're both are losers here.

769
01:04:58,490 --> 01:05:00,750
We're not born to win
like Pat or Grace.

770
01:05:01,820 --> 01:05:05,330
We must try harder
to get what's ours.

771
01:05:06,890 --> 01:05:08,060
Look, what happened to you?

772
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:09,300
It's not the same.

773
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:11,400
You cheated.

774
01:05:12,630 --> 01:05:13,870
I was just unlucky.

775
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:18,470
True.

776
01:05:19,670 --> 01:05:21,910
But don't you see? Even
if you don't cheat...

777
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:24,780
life cheats you anyways.

778
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:32,650
This is Grace's address.

779
01:05:32,790 --> 01:05:34,460
I'll see you tomorrow if
you're interested.

780
01:05:47,170 --> 01:05:49,870
Honest Commerce Printing"

781
01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:51,870
Honest Commerce Printing

782
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:24,870
Sit here, please.

783
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:29,280
Aren't you gonna take a seat?

784
01:06:40,820 --> 01:06:42,460
Here is what's gonna happen

785
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:44,120
First...

786
01:06:44,830 --> 01:06:48,160
we'll fly to Sydney and
take the STIC together.

787
01:06:58,570 --> 01:06:59,610
Hey, Lynn.

788
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:02,910
You're missing a document.

789
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:04,710
Dad.

790
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:06,880
You remember that
show, Teen Genius?

791
01:07:07,050 --> 01:07:08,620
They want me to
compete in Sydney.

792
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:21,800
They need your bank statement
for visa purposes.

793
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:23,060
Who are you going with?

794
01:07:23,530 --> 01:07:24,530
With Bank.

795
01:07:25,730 --> 01:07:26,830
Huh?

796
01:07:27,570 --> 01:07:30,070
It's not just the two of
us, there's a teacher too.

797
01:07:33,710 --> 01:07:34,640
Second...

798
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:35,940
You and I

799
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:38,250
will have to memorise
the answers, half each.

800
01:07:38,380 --> 01:07:39,450
Don't forget...

801
01:07:39,550 --> 01:07:40,550
Bank memorizes the first half,

802
01:07:40,610 --> 01:07:41,950
and Lynn memorizes the second half.

803
01:07:42,550 --> 01:07:44,420
Section 1 has 52 questions.

804
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:45,650
Start!

805
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:50,290
<b>SECTION 1</b>
<b>52 Questions</b>

806
01:07:50,420 --> 01:07:52,290
<b>SECTION 2</b>
<b>44 Questions</b>

807
01:07:52,390 --> 01:07:54,330
<b>SECTION 3</b>
<b>16 Grid-in Questions</b>

808
01:07:54,390 --> 01:07:55,630
As for the last section,

809
01:07:56,030 --> 01:08:00,200
you need to leave the exam early to
send the essay question in time.

810
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:04,000
Time's up for section 4.
Start the essay.

811
01:08:05,270 --> 01:08:07,980
Memorising the question and key words
shouldn't be a problem for you.

812
01:08:08,210 --> 01:08:12,080
But the hard part is they
won't let you leave early.

813
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:15,620
To avoid any suspicion,

814
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:17,620
you have to act sick.

815
01:08:19,090 --> 01:08:19,950
Sure.

816
01:08:20,850 --> 01:08:22,160
I can throw up.

817
01:08:31,730 --> 01:08:33,070
Do I have to puke now?

818
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:34,330
No!

819
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:42,740
How much am I getting?

820
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:49,950
1 million.

821
01:09:03,460 --> 01:09:04,900
What about you guys?

822
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:08,400
2 million.

823
01:09:13,740 --> 01:09:14,940
What do you say, Bank?

824
01:09:15,410 --> 01:09:17,210
Everything is in your hands.

825
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:23,750
Okay.

826
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:30,190
We got it!

827
01:09:30,620 --> 01:09:31,190
Right on time.

828
01:09:31,290 --> 01:09:32,290
Yes!

829
01:09:33,660 --> 01:09:36,560
You should've just said yes
from the beginner. Such a poser.

830
01:09:55,450 --> 01:09:56,480
Hey, guys!

831
01:09:59,690 --> 01:10:01,290
See you tomorrow at 1:00 p.m.

832
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,420
1:00 p.m., my ass.

833
01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:05,090
The flight's at 11:00 p.m.

834
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:06,530
What's the rush?

835
01:10:06,830 --> 01:10:09,400
There is one more thing
we need to rehearse.

836
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:18,370
Please stop.

837
01:10:18,740 --> 01:10:22,910
You just can't keep on
grilling the weakling!

838
01:10:25,580 --> 01:10:27,450
You must be enjoying...

839
01:10:27,650 --> 01:10:31,790
seeing innocents
cry like this.

840
01:10:41,830 --> 01:10:43,530
That's too much, Pat.
Way too much.

841
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,700
I've used up all my cards.

842
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,840
You guys are acting as if
we are really getting caught.

843
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:50,940
I told you I understand...

844
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:53,540
if you get caught,
we'll blame only you.

845
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:57,410
Last question before
heading to the airport.

846
01:10:57,540 --> 01:10:58,610
Last question.

847
01:11:02,050 --> 01:11:03,420
In character.

848
01:11:03,550 --> 01:11:04,580
Ready?

849
01:11:07,590 --> 01:11:09,320
What if Bank gets caught?

850
01:11:09,860 --> 01:11:11,190
What will you say?

851
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:16,700
That's even more far-fetched.

852
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:18,430
I've never been friends with him.

853
01:11:18,530 --> 01:11:20,630
I've seen him around
school for 4-5 years.

854
01:11:20,730 --> 01:11:22,370
I've never seen
him with any friends.

855
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:24,670
He looks like ass.

856
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:25,940
And he's a weirdo.

857
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:31,880
Outside of school, he even got
beaten up and dumped in a landfill.

858
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:39,290
Are we done?

859
01:11:41,790 --> 01:11:43,620
Stop!

860
01:11:44,620 --> 01:11:45,590
Bank, stop!

861
01:11:45,890 --> 01:11:46,890
Stop!

862
01:11:47,530 --> 01:11:48,830
I said stop!

863
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:51,360
Fucker!

864
01:11:52,170 --> 01:11:53,170
Bank!

865
01:12:04,540 --> 01:12:05,810
What the hell is wrong with you?

866
01:12:08,820 --> 01:12:11,350
You're the one who
told me to say this.

867
01:12:11,650 --> 01:12:13,420
So, why are you mad at me?

868
01:12:14,620 --> 01:12:16,460
Pat, stop.

869
01:12:16,690 --> 01:12:17,590
Bank...

870
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:19,090
Bank, that's enough.

871
01:12:21,860 --> 01:12:22,700
Why?

872
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:23,460
Why?

873
01:12:23,530 --> 01:12:24,300
I...

874
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:25,030
You what?!

875
01:12:25,130 --> 01:12:26,430
never...

876
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,670
told anyone that I
woke up in a landfill!

877
01:12:33,410 --> 01:12:35,210
Now you know what I'm mad about!

878
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:40,110
All of you set me up, right?

879
01:12:41,550 --> 01:12:43,920
You guys set me up so I
wouldn't get the scholarship, right?

880
01:12:45,090 --> 01:12:46,990
You were all in it, right?

881
01:12:47,820 --> 01:12:49,590
You guys knew, right?

882
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:51,790
You knew, right?

883
01:12:53,330 --> 01:12:54,660
You knew, right?

884
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:57,460
Why the fuck aren't you answering?

885
01:12:59,430 --> 01:13:00,630
Bank, Bank, Bank, Bank, Bank.

886
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:01,740
Calm down, Bank.

887
01:13:01,870 --> 01:13:03,570
I don't want to fucking
hear what you have to say!

888
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:07,770
Bank, stop! Let's talk this out.
Let's talk this out. Let's talk this out.

889
01:13:11,650 --> 01:13:13,880
Calm down. Calm down.

890
01:13:14,110 --> 01:13:15,150
Okay?

891
01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:18,750
I'm sorry, Bank.

892
01:13:18,820 --> 01:13:20,790
I'm sorry.

893
01:13:21,590 --> 01:13:23,290
I didn't think they'd
be so rough on you.

894
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:25,290
Bank, hear me out.

895
01:13:25,490 --> 01:13:27,290
You're still taking
the STIC, right?

896
01:13:28,530 --> 01:13:30,130
Fuck the STIC!

897
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:32,400
Bank, Bank, Bank, Bank, Bank.
Listen to me.

898
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:33,870
You listen to me!

899
01:13:34,170 --> 01:13:36,870
I only have my mom.

900
01:13:36,940 --> 01:13:38,610
She's like a hunchback,
doing laundry.

901
01:13:38,710 --> 01:13:39,410
You--

902
01:13:39,470 --> 01:13:40,870
I'm not rich like you.

903
01:13:41,140 --> 01:13:43,740
That scholarship was my dream.

904
01:13:44,110 --> 01:13:47,050
The dream for my mom
to live comfortably.

905
01:13:47,110 --> 01:13:48,580
And then you came.

906
01:13:49,050 --> 01:13:50,120
Bank...

907
01:13:50,420 --> 01:13:52,850
If I don't pass the STIC,
my dad will kill me.

908
01:13:53,190 --> 01:13:54,190
Please, Bank.

909
01:13:54,290 --> 01:13:55,320
Please.

910
01:13:58,660 --> 01:14:00,790
I win, you win.
It's a win-win for the both of us.

911
01:14:03,030 --> 01:14:05,730
Bank, I beg of you.

912
01:14:05,830 --> 01:14:06,930
Then...

913
01:14:07,670 --> 01:14:10,100
You should send those thugs to
beat up your dad!

914
01:14:13,570 --> 01:14:15,540
Why do you say shit like that?!

915
01:14:21,950 --> 01:14:24,750
Didn't you tell me
that you needed him?

916
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:27,820
And if I didn't play dirty,

917
01:14:28,090 --> 01:14:29,990
do you think he'd help you out?

918
01:15:03,620 --> 01:15:04,660
Lynn!

919
01:15:05,790 --> 01:15:07,530
Wait, let's talk about this.

920
01:15:08,030 --> 01:15:09,560
Were you in on this?

921
01:15:12,830 --> 01:15:14,130
I really didn't know.

922
01:15:16,100 --> 01:15:18,040
Please try to understand Pat.

923
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:21,110
He did it because he wanted
to help with your plan.

924
01:15:21,210 --> 01:15:25,110
Without considering
who would get hurt?

925
01:15:31,450 --> 01:15:35,460
The Future of Laundry

926
01:15:38,730 --> 01:15:40,390
Grace, refund the money.

927
01:15:40,490 --> 01:15:41,490
I'm out.

928
01:15:42,130 --> 01:15:43,500
Wait, Lynn.

929
01:15:44,860 --> 01:15:45,900
Calm down.

930
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,670
Okay, I respect your decision.

931
01:15:48,740 --> 01:15:49,700
If you're out, I'm out.

932
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:51,040
No more clients, okay?

933
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:53,670
It'll just be the 3 of us,
like we originally planned.

934
01:15:53,940 --> 01:15:55,710
Don't you understand?

935
01:15:56,210 --> 01:15:58,210
I said I'm out.

936
01:16:05,490 --> 01:16:06,650
Okay.

937
01:16:06,850 --> 01:16:09,090
I guess that's it.

938
01:16:13,090 --> 01:16:14,530
I just have one request,

939
01:16:14,630 --> 01:16:16,630
Don't be mad at me.

940
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:22,440
If I had half your brain,

941
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:24,970
I wouldn't do something
this stupid.

942
01:16:25,110 --> 01:16:26,110
Please.

943
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:51,530
Flight leaves in 3 hours.

944
01:16:51,630 --> 01:16:52,700
Let's get going, Lynn.

945
01:16:57,670 --> 01:16:58,670
Bank.

946
01:17:10,580 --> 01:17:11,850
I'll go through with it.

947
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:16,460
At least there's money in it.

948
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:19,960
I won't get beaten up for free.

949
01:17:21,730 --> 01:17:23,160
What if I told you that...

950
01:17:23,530 --> 01:17:24,900
I don't wanna do it anymore.

951
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:30,000
I'm not asking you.

952
01:17:31,540 --> 01:17:33,540
The only reason I'm here
is because of you.

953
01:17:33,970 --> 01:17:36,140
The only reason I ended up in a
landfill is because of you.

954
01:17:36,780 --> 01:17:39,110
The only reason all of this
shit is happening is because of you.

955
01:17:40,580 --> 01:17:43,620
Don't you think you're also responsible?

01:39:46,670 --> 01:39:47,910
I haven't seen her.

1077
01:39:50,440 --> 01:39:52,810
She told me she went to
Sydney for a competition.

1078
01:39:53,450 --> 01:39:54,410
Oh yeah.

1079
01:39:55,050 --> 01:39:57,750
No wonder why we haven't seen her.

1080
01:39:57,980 --> 01:39:59,550
I'm sure she'll
bring back a medal.

1081
01:40:01,020 --> 01:40:03,320
But I found the
permission letter at home.

1082
01:40:03,620 --> 01:40:05,320
I called, but no one answered.

1083
01:40:25,080 --> 01:40:26,910
So, I came to the address on the sheet.

1084
01:40:44,630 --> 01:40:47,000
Can someone tell me what
Lynn is doing in Sydney?

1085
01:40:58,140 --> 01:40:58,980
Huh?!

1086
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:06,650
Roger that. I can't see her.

1087
01:41:07,650 --> 01:41:09,350
<i>Okay, okay, I'm
looking. Checking.</i>

1088
01:41:12,020 --> 01:41:13,530
<i>Yup. She's not here mate.</i>

1089
01:41:14,190 --> 01:41:16,660
Keep looking. I'm coming up.

1090
01:41:28,570 --> 01:41:29,640
Did you find her?

1091
01:41:39,320 --> 01:41:40,320
<i>I'm out.</i>

1092
01:41:55,330 --> 01:41:57,840
If you don't answer me,
I'll go straight to the Headmistress.

1093
01:42:33,170 --> 01:42:35,640
Tell me, what are guys you up to again?!

1094
01:42:35,770 --> 01:42:36,640
Huh?!

1095
01:42:48,350 --> 01:42:49,590
Lynn and Bank are dating!

1096
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:52,520
They went on a secret trip.

1097
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:04,940
Lynn was afraid you
wouldn't let her go.

1098
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:06,200
So, she lied.

1099
01:43:06,470 --> 01:43:08,570
I really didn't know
how to stop her.

1100
01:43:09,270 --> 01:43:14,910
I think it's best you talk to
your daughter, sir.

1101
01:43:20,350 --> 01:43:21,020
Okay.

1102
01:43:36,670 --> 01:43:37,870
C'mon!

1103
01:43:44,940 --> 01:43:45,980
Sir,

1104
01:43:46,440 --> 01:43:48,380
Love is a beautiful thing.

1105
01:44:12,700 --> 01:44:13,910
What's the matter?

1106
01:44:14,540 --> 01:44:15,840
It's 7 a.m. already.

1107
01:44:15,910 --> 01:44:16,910
The motortaxis are leaving.

1108
01:44:16,980 --> 01:44:18,640
They're saying we passed the agreed time.

1109
01:44:18,740 --> 01:44:20,410
You explain to them what's going on

1110
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:22,250
Because I don't know a damn thing!

1111
01:44:22,310 --> 01:44:23,980
I'll talk to them.

1112
01:44:25,320 --> 01:44:26,550
What's with your leg?

1113
01:44:26,920 --> 01:44:28,690
It's almost 7:30.

1114
01:44:28,790 --> 01:44:30,420
Where at the barcodes?

1115
01:44:30,490 --> 01:44:31,520
I already paid the money.

1116
01:44:31,960 --> 01:44:33,120
What's the wait? What's the wait?

1117
01:44:42,530 --> 01:44:43,600
You'll get there in time!

1118
01:44:43,700 --> 01:44:44,970
- I promise.
- Pat!

1119
01:45:09,890 --> 01:45:11,830
Pat! We're out of stickers.

1120
01:45:20,670 --> 01:45:21,640
Here you go. 500 each.

1121
01:45:21,740 --> 01:45:23,410
We'll leave soon. We'll leave soon.

1122
01:45:44,630 --> 01:45:45,530
Shit!

1123
01:45:47,530 --> 01:45:50,400
(IN ENGLISH) Hey! Can you open the door?! Can
you open the door, please?!

1124
01:45:50,500 --> 01:45:53,570
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1125
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:37,680
It's almost 7:30 a.m., Grace!

1126
01:46:37,780 --> 01:46:38,680
Do we have all the answers?!

1127
01:46:38,780 --> 01:46:40,450
No! 6 left.

1128
01:46:43,720 --> 01:46:45,620
- Why it does say EDGE?
- Huh?

1129
01:46:45,960 --> 01:46:47,290
It says EDGE!

1130
01:46:47,390 --> 01:46:48,360
What's EDGE?!

1131
01:46:48,460 --> 01:46:50,060
There's no reception.

1132
01:47:01,240 --> 01:47:02,470
What happens if
we don't make it?

1133
01:47:02,610 --> 01:47:04,140
And the money we paid?

1134
01:47:04,780 --> 01:47:06,040
We won't make it!

1135
01:47:06,110 --> 01:47:07,680
If we don't make it, we want our refund!

1136
01:47:11,980 --> 01:47:12,980
C'mon.

1137
01:47:13,080 --> 01:47:14,350
Did you get it, yet?

1138
01:47:56,630 --> 01:47:57,500
C

1139
01:47:59,630 --> 01:48:00,500
B

1140
01:48:00,870 --> 01:48:01,700
C

1141
01:48:02,100 --> 01:48:02,930
D

1142
01:48:13,880 --> 01:48:16,310
These 3 go to the
Bangkapi exam center.

1143
01:48:16,410 --> 01:48:18,280
These 2 rows to Suttisarn.

1144
01:48:18,350 --> 01:48:19,680
Did you get on, yet?

1145
01:48:20,050 --> 01:48:21,520
You didn't put your helmet on, put it on!

1146
01:48:22,650 --> 01:48:23,960
One set each, pass it on.

1147
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:25,520
One set each!

1148
01:48:25,960 --> 01:48:27,090
We're ready!

1149
01:48:27,160 --> 01:48:28,460
Hurry up!

1150
01:48:28,690 --> 01:48:30,400
Wear your helmet!

1151
01:48:33,400 --> 01:48:34,230
Hey!

1152
01:48:51,420 --> 01:48:52,580
Are you okay?

1153
01:48:53,820 --> 01:48:55,420
(IN ENGLISH) No. I'm sick.

1154
01:48:55,490 --> 01:48:57,420
This doesn't matter.

1155
01:48:57,660 --> 01:48:59,990
You have to come back to
the test center with me.

1156
01:49:00,090 --> 01:49:00,830
Now!

1157
01:49:00,890 --> 01:49:01,730
Now!

1158
01:49:22,280 --> 01:49:23,920
I'm from the embassy.

1159
01:49:24,080 --> 01:49:26,450
A Thai student confessed to using
his phone as a dictionary.

1160
01:49:26,550 --> 01:49:27,850
We're resolving the situation.

1161
01:49:28,350 --> 01:49:29,790
(IN THAI) What will happen to him?

1162
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:32,460
They'll probably
cancel his scores.

1163
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:35,360
Worst case, he'll be banned
from the STIC forever.

1164
01:49:35,690 --> 01:49:39,530
As for you, they'll be questioning you.
If there isn't anything else, you may leave.

1165
01:49:40,500 --> 01:49:41,500
Just wait here.

1166
01:49:41,570 --> 01:49:42,830
I'll go talk to them.

1167
01:50:27,450 --> 01:50:28,310
Hold on.

1168
01:50:32,120 --> 01:50:33,320
What's the matter?

1169
01:50:54,240 --> 01:50:55,040
Huh?

1170
01:51:00,310 --> 01:51:01,880
May I use the toilet?

1171
01:51:01,950 --> 01:51:02,880
Of course.

1172
01:51:32,610 --> 01:51:33,540
Lynn!

1173
01:51:33,610 --> 01:51:35,480
Welcome back. Welcome back.

1174
01:51:36,110 --> 01:51:37,480
Mentor Lynn's FC here!

1175
01:51:40,150 --> 01:51:41,350
Thanks so much, Lynn.

1176
01:51:44,590 --> 01:51:46,990
We're celebrating at my house tonight.

1177
01:51:47,090 --> 01:51:48,230
Celebrate what?

1178
01:51:49,030 --> 01:51:50,490
Did you know that Bank got caught?

1179
01:51:51,300 --> 01:51:53,630
And my scores were cancelled, Pat.

1180
01:51:57,540 --> 01:51:58,840
Well...

1181
01:51:58,940 --> 01:52:01,340
we'll look for another
exam centre for you.

1182
01:52:01,940 --> 01:52:03,570
If you don't retake the exam,

1183
01:52:03,640 --> 01:52:06,140
you won't be able to apply
to university in time.

1184
01:52:08,610 --> 01:52:09,950
Hey, Lynn.

1185
01:52:10,050 --> 01:52:11,850
You have to retake the exam.

1186
01:52:12,150 --> 01:52:14,120
Pretty please?

1187
01:52:16,850 --> 01:52:18,220
I've changed my mind.

1188
01:52:19,490 --> 01:52:21,390
You've already got the
scores you needed.

1189
01:52:26,360 --> 01:52:27,370
But,

1190
01:52:27,430 --> 01:52:29,830
we can't go without you!

1191
01:52:34,770 --> 01:52:36,470
You do know, right?

1192
01:52:37,540 --> 01:52:40,650
That university exams aren't
multiple choices anymore.

1193
01:52:43,250 --> 01:52:45,350
Even if I went with you,

1194
01:52:45,650 --> 01:52:47,620
you wouldn't be able to copy me anyways.

1195
01:52:53,360 --> 01:52:54,530
I'll get back on my own.

1196
01:53:27,160 --> 01:53:28,490
Where's your boyfriend?

1197
01:53:31,860 --> 01:53:32,730
Where is he?

1198
01:53:38,040 --> 01:53:39,540
I wanted to invite him for dinner.

1199
01:53:45,740 --> 01:53:46,610
Where is he, huh?

1200
01:53:49,780 --> 01:53:51,550
Why didn't you tell me about him?

1201
01:53:58,520 --> 01:54:00,590
- Dad!
- Huh?

1202
01:54:03,560 --> 01:54:05,560
I have a confession to make.

1203
01:54:06,430 --> 01:54:07,430
What is it, honey?

1204
01:54:10,700 --> 01:54:11,670
What is it?

1205
01:54:25,150 --> 01:54:28,150
Why do you choose
to study in Education?

1206
01:54:29,090 --> 01:54:30,690
I want like to be a teacher,
like my father.

1207
01:54:30,790 --> 01:54:33,460
So, I can use my knowledge
in the best way.

1208
01:54:34,560 --> 01:54:41,170
Do you have experience in tutoring
or have you taught anyone before?

1209
01:54:43,370 --> 01:54:44,370
Yes, I have.

1210
01:54:59,620 --> 01:55:02,420
I scored 1,460 points on STIC

1211
01:55:02,490 --> 01:55:06,120
Being a teacher isn't
just about being good acedemically.

1212
01:55:07,090 --> 01:55:08,460
Do you think...

1213
01:55:08,560 --> 01:55:11,730
you can be a good example
in other things as well?

1214
01:55:23,910 --> 01:55:26,040
[Lynn. When are you coming?]
[Bank's taken his share, come get yours]

1215
01:55:26,110 --> 01:55:27,680
[Come quick, we already miss you]

1216
01:55:27,780 --> 01:55:29,410
I'm not going to lie.

1217
01:55:30,310 --> 01:55:33,320
I've done a lot a bad
things in the past.

1218
01:55:33,820 --> 01:55:34,820
But I will use them

1219
01:55:34,920 --> 01:55:36,920
to teach myself and others.

1220
01:55:38,790 --> 01:55:41,290
[Lynn left the chat]

1221
01:56:00,610 --> 01:56:02,550
It is such a waste,

1222
01:56:03,550 --> 01:56:06,320
To be honest, with
your knowledge and abilities,

1223
01:56:07,250 --> 01:56:10,520
You can apply for scholarships
to study abroad easily.

1224
01:56:11,090 --> 01:56:13,320
Aren't you interested
in any of them?

1225
01:56:14,960 --> 01:56:16,390
I think...

1226
01:56:17,330 --> 01:56:19,930
there's someone else who
deserves it more than me.

1227
01:56:24,240 --> 01:56:30,640
Student Expulsion Letter:
Thanaphon Viriyakul

1228
01:57:15,950 --> 01:57:18,460
Bank:
[Meet me at my place tonight.]

1229
01:58:02,930 --> 01:58:03,830
Come in.

1230
01:58:10,540 --> 01:58:12,640
The store looks
fresh, Little Bank.

1231
01:58:13,140 --> 01:58:14,810
Oh wait, it's Mister Bank now.

1232
01:58:15,550 --> 01:58:16,610
You laundering money?

1233
01:58:18,550 --> 01:58:20,420
You were expelled from
school because

1234
01:58:20,480 --> 01:58:22,850
the embassy reported you, right?

1235
01:58:24,820 --> 01:58:25,660
Hmm.

1236
01:58:28,160 --> 01:58:29,490
What's next?

1237
01:58:31,530 --> 01:58:33,360
That's the reason why
I asked you over.

1238
01:58:36,330 --> 01:58:38,400
Did you apply for
the GAT/PAT exams?

1239
01:58:40,570 --> 01:58:42,610
I have a proposition for you.

1240
01:58:47,110 --> 01:58:50,780
I have a fool-proof plan.
Much safer.

1241
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:52,550
We can get the answers
out to more people.

1242
01:58:53,150 --> 01:58:57,620
More importantly, there're more
GAT/PAT clients than STIC clients.

1243
01:58:58,620 --> 01:58:59,620
But this plan...

1244
01:59:03,230 --> 01:59:05,160
can't be done without Mentor Lynn.

1245
01:59:28,690 --> 01:59:30,020
How much more of this do you need?

1246
01:59:30,990 --> 01:59:32,890
If your cut wasn't enough...

1247
01:59:34,560 --> 01:59:36,290
my cut is still with Pat.

1248
01:59:36,360 --> 01:59:37,460
You can go get it.

1249
01:59:43,170 --> 01:59:43,830
No.

1250
01:59:44,030 --> 01:59:44,900
Wait.

1251
01:59:47,540 --> 01:59:49,240
It's not about how much money we got.

1252
01:59:50,740 --> 01:59:51,980
It's about,

1253
01:59:52,580 --> 01:59:53,610
from now on,

1254
01:59:54,680 --> 01:59:56,380
how much more we can make.

1255
01:59:58,420 --> 01:59:59,250
Lynn.

1256
02:00:01,090 --> 02:00:02,790
From my calculations.

1257
02:00:04,390 --> 02:00:05,390
This round...

1258
02:00:06,660 --> 02:00:08,160
there's at least
10 million in it.

1259
02:00:09,060 --> 02:00:12,630
Don't you think it's
worth the risk again?

1260
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:16,000
You were there.

1261
02:00:16,230 --> 02:00:19,570
Even if we get caught,
it doesn't mean we go to jail.

1262
02:00:24,240 --> 02:00:25,380
To be honest, Lynn.

1263
02:00:26,080 --> 02:00:27,910
Why would you endure
studying for 4 years

1264
02:00:27,980 --> 02:00:29,680
for a 5 figure salary?

1265
02:00:30,150 --> 02:00:32,950
When you can earn millions right now.

1266
02:00:34,050 --> 02:00:36,520
Why work a stupid desk job?

1267
02:00:47,330 --> 02:00:48,870
That's probably because for me,

1268
02:00:49,430 --> 02:00:51,340
no amount of money is worth it.

1269
02:01:00,880 --> 02:01:01,680
Lynn.

1270
02:01:03,750 --> 02:01:05,250
If you don't do this...

1271
02:01:07,250 --> 02:01:08,920
I'll tell everyone that

1272
02:01:08,990 --> 02:01:10,620
you're the mastermind
behind the STIC scandal.

1273
02:01:11,160 --> 02:01:11,960
I guarantee you.

1274
02:01:12,020 --> 02:01:14,560
You'll be banned from
studying abroad just like me.

1275
02:01:22,230 --> 02:01:25,340
Fine. We're even then.

1276
02:01:28,410 --> 02:01:30,070
It won't just be you!

1277
02:01:30,370 --> 02:01:31,240
This includes Grace,

1278
02:01:31,380 --> 02:01:32,280
Pat,

1279
02:01:32,540 --> 02:01:34,880
and all the clients who
took the STIC too.

1280
02:01:35,880 --> 02:01:36,950
Think about it...

1281
02:01:37,110 --> 02:01:38,350
if the board finds out,

1282
02:01:38,480 --> 02:01:40,550
they might even cancel all the
scores in Thailand.

1283
02:01:53,700 --> 02:01:54,900
One last thing, Lynn.

1284
02:01:57,170 --> 02:01:59,240
Your dad will be so
disappointed in you.

1285
02:02:01,540 --> 02:02:02,610
Don't be afraid, honey.

1286
02:02:05,540 --> 02:02:07,440
We'll get through
this, no matter what.

1287
02:02:09,050 --> 02:02:10,550
Smile.

1288
02:02:11,950 --> 02:02:13,780
Smile with me.

1289
02:02:30,170 --> 02:02:31,270
Ms. Rinrada?

1290
02:02:31,370 --> 02:02:32,970
<i>You once told me...</i>

1291
02:02:34,770 --> 02:02:36,410
if we win, we win together.

1292
02:02:37,140 --> 02:02:39,240
If we lose, we lose together.

1293
02:02:41,040 --> 02:02:43,150
I won't be the only one
taking all the blame.

1294
02:02:44,410 --> 02:02:45,550
If you won't do it,

1295
02:02:45,950 --> 02:02:48,150
I'll make sure you go down with me!

1296
02:02:55,960 --> 02:02:56,990
What do you say, Lynn?

1297
02:03:00,530 --> 02:03:01,830
What's it going to be?

1298
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:05,340
Everything is up to you now.

1299
02:03:12,440 --> 02:03:14,810
You're right.
Everything <i>is</i> up to me.

1300
02:03:43,570 --> 02:03:45,640
We are here to record your confession

1301
02:03:45,740 --> 02:03:48,880
to the suspected cheating on the STIC test.

1302
02:03:49,780 --> 02:03:52,050
So, are you ready?

1303
02:03:58,090 --> 02:03:59,020
(IN ENGLISH) I'm ready.
