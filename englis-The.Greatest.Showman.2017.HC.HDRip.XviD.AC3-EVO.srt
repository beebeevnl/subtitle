174
00:11:19,998 --> 00:11:21,264
- Mr. Smith?
- Yes.

175
00:11:21,266 --> 00:11:22,899
- Have a look at this.
- Of course.

176
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,586
Yes, yes, I see it.

177
00:11:43,588 --> 00:11:45,055
Thank you,
Chalmers, that'll do.

178
00:11:45,057 --> 00:11:47,426
Sir, Phineas Taylor Barnum.

179
00:11:47,428 --> 00:11:49,293
If I may, sir...

180
00:11:49,295 --> 00:11:50,961
I believe
I have skills and ideas

181
00:11:50,963 --> 00:11:52,397
that go well beyond
punching numbers

182
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,364
into an adding machine.

183
00:11:53,366 --> 00:11:54,832
Well, I've read about
this German fellow,

184
00:11:54,834 --> 00:11:56,500
Lilienthal, I believe,
who's developed

185
00:11:56,502 --> 00:11:59,071
a glider that can take
a man in the air, sir.

186
00:11:59,073 --> 00:12:00,370
Isn't that amazing?

187
00:12:00,372 --> 00:12:02,539
I mean, if you were
to apply that to this business,

188
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:03,941
it would be revolutionary.

189
00:12:03,943 --> 00:12:06,811
Gentlemen!
Can I have your attention?

190
00:12:06,813 --> 00:12:08,649
You're all dismissed.

191
00:12:09,781 --> 00:12:11,081
Bankrupt?

192
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:13,184
I thought the company
had a dozen trading ships.

193
00:12:13,186 --> 00:12:15,289
Yes, at the bottom
of the South China Sea.

194
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:18,393
Typhoon sank 'em all.

195
00:12:55,531 --> 00:12:58,301
- Tag, you're it!
- Oh, you're in for it!

196
00:12:59,133 --> 00:13:00,034
Hey.

197
00:13:00,036 --> 00:13:02,703
Oh, God! You're home early.

198
00:13:02,705 --> 00:13:04,273
And until further notice.

199
00:13:08,311 --> 00:13:10,444
Well, I didn't think
you were long for that job.

200
00:13:10,446 --> 00:13:12,279
Or any job, apparently.

201
00:13:12,281 --> 00:13:14,718
That's what makes our life
together so exciting.

202
00:13:15,384 --> 00:13:17,086
Charity.

203
00:13:19,989 --> 00:13:22,723
This isn't the life
I promised you.

204
00:13:22,725 --> 00:13:24,627
But I have everything I want.

205
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:26,195
What about the magic?

206
00:13:26,197 --> 00:13:27,930
What do you call
those two girls?

207
00:13:30,634 --> 00:13:33,004
Hey, you partners, look who
moseyed into the corral.

208
00:13:34,737 --> 00:13:35,937
Daddy!

209
00:13:35,939 --> 00:13:37,272
- Come here!
- Did you bring a present?

210
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:38,839
A present for what?

211
00:13:38,841 --> 00:13:40,474
- For my birthday!
- Your what?

212
00:13:40,476 --> 00:13:43,177
- My birthday.
- It's not your birthday.

213
00:13:43,179 --> 00:13:46,113
Okay, I do have a present...

214
00:13:46,115 --> 00:13:48,250
but not just any present.
Oh, no.

215
00:13:48,252 --> 00:13:51,721
The most amazing
birthday present ever.

216
00:13:51,723 --> 00:13:54,289
This extraordinary machine
was originally created

217
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,225
by Leonardo da Vinci,
400 years ago.

218
00:13:56,227 --> 00:13:58,595
But the blueprints had been
lost for centuries

219
00:13:58,597 --> 00:14:00,897
until just last week,
on a stormy night,

220
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:03,032
when a sunken pirate ship
washed up

221
00:14:03,034 --> 00:14:04,834
on the shores of Nantucket.

222
00:14:04,836 --> 00:14:07,137
They found skeletons
and treasures

223
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:08,970
and the blueprints
were recovered

224
00:14:08,972 --> 00:14:14,077
by none other
than J. W. Mercantile.

225
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,480
The blueprints crossed my desk
very briefly

226
00:14:16,482 --> 00:14:18,548
but I managed
to commit them to memory.

227
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:22,756
And if I have
remembered correctly...

228
00:14:29,328 --> 00:14:31,531
Happy birthday, Caroline.

229
00:14:38,906 --> 00:14:40,606
This is a wishing machine.

230
00:14:40,608 --> 00:14:42,510
You tell it your wishes...

231
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:46,477
and it keeps them safe
until they come true.

232
00:14:46,479 --> 00:14:50,515
Even if you forget them,
they're always there.

233
00:14:50,517 --> 00:14:51,683
Can I tell a wish?

234
00:14:51,685 --> 00:14:54,184
Step right up. Go ahead.

235
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:57,990
I wish to marry Santa Claus.

236
00:14:57,992 --> 00:14:59,795
That is a good wish.

237
00:15:00,894 --> 00:15:04,665
I wish for ballet slippers.

238
00:15:10,739 --> 00:15:12,740
Hey, that's a good wish, too.

239
00:15:13,374 --> 00:15:15,143
What's your wish, Mommy?

240
00:15:16,844 --> 00:15:18,647
I wish...

241
00:15:23,051 --> 00:15:26,085
for happiness
like this forever

242
00:15:26,087 --> 00:15:27,789
for you and you...

243
00:15:29,558 --> 00:15:31,394
and for your father.

244
00:15:31,893 --> 00:15:33,561
Boring!

245
00:15:33,563 --> 00:15:35,262
Boring?

246
00:15:35,264 --> 00:15:38,565
Since when has happiness
ever been boring?

247
00:15:38,567 --> 00:15:41,634
<i>♪ Ev'ry night I lie in bed ♪</i>

248
00:15:41,636 --> 00:15:44,805
<i>♪ The brightest colors

249
00:15:44,807 --> 00:15:49,780
<i>♪ A million dreams

250
00:15:51,546 --> 00:15:55,082
<i>♪ I think of

251
00:15:55,084 --> 00:15:58,318

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,758

253
00:16:06,562 --> 00:16:08,663

00:16:08,665 --> 00:16:11,869
<i>♪ For the world

255
00:16:26,249 --> 00:16:29,784
The goat prices go up,
so the pork bellies go down.

256
00:16:30,988 --> 00:16:33,120
- Charles, we're leaving.
- Huh?

257
00:16:33,122 --> 00:16:34,624
This bank only wants
to lend money

258
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:35,761
to people with money.

259
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,734
What are you
looking at, flop-doodle?

260
00:16:45,003 --> 00:16:46,906
Mr. Barnum.

261
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:52,708
This venture you propose
is risky and somewhat bizarre.

262
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,678
It's a good bet
is what it is, sir.

263
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,346
People don't
want to admit it...

264
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:59,117
but they're fascinated
with the exotic and the macabre.

265
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:00,785
It's why we stare at it.

266
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:03,590
The bank is going to need
substantial collateral.

267
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:08,091
Of course. I, uh,
I wouldn't suggest otherwise.

268
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:10,194
The deed and title
to my entire flotilla

269
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,398
of trading vessels.

270
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,300
<i>Why would a
bank loan us $10,000?</i>

271
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:19,637
Because we put up collateral.

272
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:21,105
But, dear, we don't
have any collateral.

273
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:22,106
Sure we do.

274
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:23,375
In the South China Seas.

275
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:25,076
In the South China Seas?

276
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:27,311
Deep in the South China Seas.

277
00:17:27,313 --> 00:17:30,515
And what did
we buy with this loan?

278
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:33,752
"Barnum's American Museum
of Curiosities."

279
00:17:33,754 --> 00:17:35,423
What kind of museum is it?

280
00:17:38,159 --> 00:17:39,590
A place to be transported.

281
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:41,193
A place where people
can see things

282
00:17:41,195 --> 00:17:42,362
they've never seen before.

283
00:17:42,763 --> 00:17:43,595
Huh?

284
00:17:43,597 --> 00:17:45,696
- Wax figures?
- Yeah. Yeah.

285
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:47,566
They're all the rage
in Europe. Look.

286
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:50,203
Marie Antoinette with the
sore throat. Napoleon.

287
00:17:50,205 --> 00:17:52,104
Come here. See?

288
00:17:52,106 --> 00:17:55,007
You've already met some of the
most famous folks in history.

289
00:17:55,009 --> 00:17:56,375
But they're not all wax.

290
00:17:56,377 --> 00:17:59,879
This is the great O'Malley.

291
00:17:59,881 --> 00:18:02,648
Master of sleight of hand.
A king of deception.

292
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,553
You don't look like a magician.

293
00:18:05,286 --> 00:18:06,852
I'm a thief.

294
00:18:06,854 --> 00:18:07,953
A very good thief.

295
00:18:07,955 --> 00:18:10,022
I caught him nicking my watch.

296
00:18:10,024 --> 00:18:11,124
- See?
- An elephant!

297
00:18:11,126 --> 00:18:12,226
Not just any elephant.

298
00:18:12,228 --> 00:18:13,226
I can get you
somethin' real nice.

299
00:18:13,228 --> 00:18:14,227
Just say the word.

300
00:18:14,229 --> 00:18:15,262
Thank you.

301
00:18:15,264 --> 00:18:16,595
Oh, yeah.
This is a ten-ton bull

302
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:18,599
straight from
the plains of Africa.

303
00:18:18,601 --> 00:18:21,168
And look at that.

304
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:23,139
The tallest giraffe
in the world.

305
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:24,670
Can I climb up its leg?

306
00:18:24,672 --> 00:18:27,072
Absolutely not. Okay.

307
00:18:27,074 --> 00:18:30,044
Now, I know how it looks.

308
00:18:30,046 --> 00:18:31,477
If you didn't,
I'd be worried.

309
00:18:31,479 --> 00:18:33,313
I mean, it just
needs a little work, but...

310
00:18:33,315 --> 00:18:34,747
The loan has to be
paid back every month.

311
00:18:34,749 --> 00:18:36,650
Oh, yeah, we're gonna pay it.
We just need customers.

312
00:18:36,652 --> 00:18:38,322
- Hundreds of them.
- We're gonna get them.

313
00:18:41,591 --> 00:18:43,257
Welcome to the Barnum Museum.

314
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:44,624
It is one hour
of your time, sir,

315
00:18:44,626 --> 00:18:46,160
but it will change your life.

316
00:18:46,162 --> 00:18:47,495
We have shows
on the hour every hour.

317
00:18:47,497 --> 00:18:49,163
I love your dress.

318
00:18:49,165 --> 00:18:50,631
Surely not for
the faint of heart,

319
00:18:50,633 --> 00:18:52,534
but I can tell
you're gonna love it.

320
00:18:52,536 --> 00:18:54,436
Half price for anyone
who's wearing a hat.

321
00:18:54,438 --> 00:18:55,670
Ho, ho! That's you, sir.

322
00:18:55,672 --> 00:18:58,707
Welcome to the Barnum Museum.

323
00:19:04,682 --> 00:19:05,647
Load of garbage.

324
00:19:05,649 --> 00:19:07,249
Goodness, no. It's rubbish.

325
00:19:07,251 --> 00:19:09,317
Welcome to the Barnum Museum,
where everyone's special...

326
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:11,120
How many tickets?

327
00:19:11,122 --> 00:19:13,391
- Three.
- Three.

328
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,051
Daddy.

329
00:19:44,623 --> 00:19:46,025
Daddy.

330
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:53,463
Did you sell
any more tickets today?

331
00:19:53,465 --> 00:19:55,599
A few. Yeah.

332
00:19:55,601 --> 00:19:57,867
Most everyone was rushing home,
it's Friday,

333
00:19:57,869 --> 00:20:02,839
but we sold a few.

334
00:20:02,841 --> 00:20:06,943
I think you have too many dead
things in your museum, Daddy.

335
00:20:06,945 --> 00:20:08,345
Do you?

336
00:20:08,347 --> 00:20:11,652
She's right.
You need something alive.

337
00:20:14,655 --> 00:20:16,320
Go to sleep, both of you.

338
00:20:16,322 --> 00:20:18,658
Something sensational.

339
00:20:19,292 --> 00:20:20,893
That's a big word.

340
00:20:20,895 --> 00:20:23,095
It's your word.

341
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:26,097
Something that isn't stuffed.

342
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:28,602
- Like a mermaid.
- Or a unicorn.

343
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:32,304
Unicorns aren't real.

344
00:20:32,306 --> 00:20:34,777
<i>Well, mermaids
aren't real either.</i>

345
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:03,369
You must be Gertrude Stratton.

346
00:21:03,371 --> 00:21:04,640
I'm looking for your son.

347
00:21:05,408 --> 00:21:06,743
I don't have a son.

348
00:21:07,443 --> 00:21:09,076
The hospital record says you do.

349
00:21:09,078 --> 00:21:11,514

I am putting together a show

354
00:21:39,877 --> 00:21:41,111

355
00:21:42,246 --> 00:21:44,346

to laugh at me.

anyway, kid,

357
00:21:45,681 --> 00:21:46,951
so might as well get paid.

358
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,428
I see a soldier,
no, a general

359
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:01,930
riding across the stage
with a sword and a gun,

360
00:22:01,932 --> 00:22:03,532

ever made.

from all over the world,

363
00:22:07,971 --> 00:22:10,975
and when they see him,
they won't laugh.

364
00:22:16,148 --> 00:22:17,817
They'll salute.

365
00:22:33,698 --> 00:22:34,968

366
00:22:41,641 --> 00:22:43,507

00:30:46,045 --> 00:30:49,212
Hot, salted peanuts. Piping hot!

524
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:51,414
One for me, one for the lady.

525
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:53,118
O'Malley.

526
00:30:56,989 --> 00:30:59,758
Ah, Mr. Bennett
from the <i>Herald.</i>

527
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,860
Come to take in
another show, huh?

528
00:31:01,862 --> 00:31:03,060
Tell me, Mr. Barnum,

529
00:31:03,062 --> 00:31:04,228
does it bother you

530
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:07,134
that everything
you're selling is fake?

531
00:31:07,834 --> 00:31:09,500
Do these smiles seem fake?

532
00:31:09,502 --> 00:31:10,768
It doesn't matter
where they come from.

533
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:12,002
The joy is real.

534
00:31:12,004 --> 00:31:13,570
So, you are a philanthropist?

535
00:31:13,572 --> 00:31:16,307
Well, hyperbole
isn't the worst crime.

536
00:31:16,309 --> 00:31:19,310
Men suffer more from imagining
too little than too much.

537
00:31:19,312 --> 00:31:21,748
The creed of a true fraud.

538
00:31:23,084 --> 00:31:25,317
Mr. Bennett, when was
the last time you smiled

539
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:27,722
or had a good laugh?
Like a real laugh?

540
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:32,290
A theater critic who can't
find joy in the theater.

541
00:31:32,292 --> 00:31:34,529
Now who's a fraud?

542
00:31:36,897 --> 00:31:39,065
Oh, Mr. Bennett.

543
00:31:39,067 --> 00:31:41,837
That word you used
to describe my show?

544
00:31:42,904 --> 00:31:44,106
Has a nice ring to it.

545
00:31:54,183 --> 00:31:55,950
And right this way.

546
00:31:55,952 --> 00:31:59,152
Don't you think there's enough
blind trust in my life?

547
00:31:59,154 --> 00:32:00,855
Well, isn't that
what makes it fun?

548
00:32:00,857 --> 00:32:04,793
Keep coming. Okay.
Are you ready?

549
00:32:11,234 --> 00:32:12,836
- Is it?
- It is.

550
00:32:15,905 --> 00:32:18,142
Come on. Let's go.

551
00:32:18,442 --> 00:32:19,676
Push.

552
00:32:21,811 --> 00:32:22,812
Wow.

553
00:32:24,781 --> 00:32:26,513
Helen, that's for you.

554
00:32:29,217 --> 00:32:32,822
And Caroline,
this is for you.

555
00:32:40,197 --> 00:32:42,098
There's a ballet school
right down the street.

556
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,668
Just past your
parents' house, actually.

557
00:32:46,403 --> 00:32:47,869
Don't tell me
you bought this house

558
00:32:47,871 --> 00:32:50,237
just to rub my parents' noses
in your success?

559
00:32:50,239 --> 00:32:52,442
Well, that wasn't
the only reason.

560
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:56,246
This is the life I promised you.

561
00:32:56,947 --> 00:32:58,415
Shall we?

562
00:32:58,417 --> 00:33:01,917
Phin, it's beautiful,

563
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,754
but you know, we don't
need all of this to be...

564
00:33:03,756 --> 00:33:05,221
It only took me 25 years,

565
00:33:05,223 --> 00:33:08,190
but welcome home,
Charity Barnum.

566
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,002
- Hello, there.
- There goes Barnum.

567
00:33:56,376 --> 00:33:59,110
Hey, sweetheart, who's
that young man over there?

568
00:33:59,112 --> 00:34:00,911
Oh, that's Phillip Carlyle.

569
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:03,348
A bit of a scandal, they say.

570
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,949
His last play
was a hit in London.

571
00:34:04,951 --> 00:34:06,551
Play? You pay good money

572
00:34:06,553 --> 00:34:09,121
to watch people stand around
and talk for two hours

573
00:34:09,123 --> 00:34:10,589
and they call me a con man.

574
00:34:10,591 --> 00:34:13,959
Ew, what's that smell?
Do you smell that?

575
00:34:13,961 --> 00:34:16,194
Ew. Something does smell.

576
00:34:16,196 --> 00:34:19,065
Oh, I know what it is.
Peanuts.

577
00:34:28,776 --> 00:34:30,341
I can see it right now.

578
00:34:30,343 --> 00:34:31,676
"Youngest prima ballerina

579
00:34:31,678 --> 00:34:33,547
in the history
of the City Ballet."

580
00:34:35,251 --> 00:34:36,483
I'm quitting.

581
00:34:36,485 --> 00:34:38,385
What? Why would you quit?

582
00:34:38,387 --> 00:34:40,820
I started too late.
I'll never catch up.

583
00:34:40,822 --> 00:34:42,958
Caroline, you were the best
dancer on that stage.

584
00:34:44,592 --> 00:34:47,360
What? You think
I can't spot talent?

585
00:34:47,362 --> 00:34:50,030
Ballet takes years
of hard work.

586
00:34:50,032 --> 00:34:51,401
It's not like the circus.

587
00:34:53,101 --> 00:34:54,369
You can't just fake it.

588
00:34:58,908 --> 00:35:00,174
She can't quit. No.

589
00:35:00,176 --> 00:35:01,442
No, I mean, she just...

590
00:35:01,444 --> 00:35:03,278
She just feels out of place
with the other girls.

591
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,812
Well, I should
certainly hope so.

592
00:35:04,814 --> 00:35:07,147
I've never seen so many
little prima donnas in my life.

593
00:35:07,149 --> 00:35:09,383
Yeah, but those prima donnas
are the most important thing

594
00:35:09,385 --> 00:35:10,718
in the world to her right now.

595
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,120
She'll learn to ignore them
just like I did.

596
00:35:13,122 --> 00:35:14,555
She shouldn't have to.

597
00:35:14,557 --> 00:35:16,558
New York society
will never accept us.

598
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,392
If they did,
they'd have to stop judging

599
00:35:18,394 --> 00:35:20,261
and actually do something
with their lives.

600
00:35:20,263 --> 00:35:21,632
This isn't about me.

601
00:35:22,766 --> 00:35:27,436
Oh. So it's different
than everything else then?

602
00:35:27,438 --> 00:35:30,105
I just want her to be proud
of who she is, of her family.

603
00:35:30,107 --> 00:35:32,206
She is proud.

604
00:35:32,208 --> 00:35:33,811
We don't have
to be the Carlyles.

605
00:35:39,449 --> 00:35:41,516
Mr. Carlyle.
You produced this play?

606
00:35:41,518 --> 00:35:43,684
Yes, I did indeed.

607
00:35:43,686 --> 00:35:45,921
Refunds are available
at the front box office.

608
00:35:45,923 --> 00:35:47,725
P.T. Barnum.

609
00:35:47,727 --> 00:35:48,658
From the circus?

610
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,660
Yes. You... you've been?

611
00:35:50,662 --> 00:35:54,131
God, no. But I have
seen the crowds.

612
00:35:54,133 --> 00:35:56,765
People leave your shows a great deal
happier than when they came in.

613
00:35:56,767 --> 00:35:59,435
Which is much more
than I can say for my play.

614
00:35:59,437 --> 00:36:01,673
And yet, you have
no trouble selling tickets.

615
00:36:03,341 --> 00:36:05,077
That's because
I'm selling virtue.

616
00:36:07,379 --> 00:36:08,714
Can I buy you a drink?

617
00:36:10,784 --> 00:36:13,116
I wanna go after
the carriage trade.

618
00:36:13,118 --> 00:36:15,219
Present legitimate acts,

619
00:36:15,221 --> 00:36:18,590
expand our appeal,
go after the snobs.

620
00:36:18,592 --> 00:36:20,958
If you only knew
how suffocating they are.

621
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,427
So come join the circus.

622
00:36:22,429 --> 00:36:24,030
You clearly have a flair
for show business.

623
00:36:25,565 --> 00:36:27,400
Teach me how to appeal
to the highbrows.

624
00:36:28,467 --> 00:36:30,634
- Are you serious?
- Mm-hmm.

625
00:36:30,636 --> 00:36:33,036
Mr. Barnum, I can't just run off
and join the circus.

626
00:36:33,038 --> 00:36:35,039
Why not?
Sounds thrilling, doesn't it?

627
00:36:35,041 --> 00:36:37,008
Let's just say that I find it
much more comfortable

628
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:38,811
admiring your show from afar.

629
00:36:38,813 --> 00:36:40,479
Comfort, the enemy of progress.

630
00:36:40,481 --> 00:36:42,280
Do you understand that
just associating with you

631
00:36:42,282 --> 00:36:43,916
could cost me my inheritance?

632
00:36:43,918 --> 00:36:45,684
Oh, it could cost you
more than that.

633
00:36:45,686 --> 00:36:47,285
You'd be risking everything.

634
00:36:47,287 --> 00:36:49,053
But, on the other hand, well,

635
00:36:49,055 --> 00:36:52,157
you just might
find yourself a free man.

724
00:40:59,215 --> 00:41:03,352
Hey, hey! No one's buying hats
back here. Get out front, go!

725
00:41:03,354 --> 00:41:04,986
W.D., Anne, I wanna introduce

726
00:41:04,988 --> 00:41:07,092
my newest hire,
Mr. Phillip Carlyle.

727
00:41:08,827 --> 00:41:10,762
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Yeah, pleasure.

728
00:41:12,063 --> 00:41:14,099
And what is your act,
Mr. Carlyle?

729
00:41:14,798 --> 00:41:16,701
I don't have an act.

730
00:41:18,003 --> 00:41:19,771
Everyone's got an act.

731
00:41:25,511 --> 00:41:26,643
Mr. Barnum!

732
00:41:26,645 --> 00:41:28,014
Yeah.

733
00:41:29,247 --> 00:41:30,382
You better come see this.

734
00:41:31,917 --> 00:41:33,453
Phillip, keep up!

735
00:41:37,288 --> 00:41:39,621
A bit of a nasty element.

736
00:41:39,623 --> 00:41:41,026
There always is, isn't there?

737
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,960
Nothing draws a crowd
quite like a crowd.

738
00:41:43,962 --> 00:41:45,395
We don't want you in our city!

739
00:41:45,397 --> 00:41:47,300
Go home, you freaks!

740
00:41:48,133 --> 00:41:48,932
Freaks!

741
00:41:48,934 --> 00:41:50,400
"Shame of the city."

742
00:41:50,402 --> 00:41:52,936
"The protests cement
Mr. Barnum's reputation

743
00:41:52,938 --> 00:41:55,840
as a purveyor of the offensive
and indecent."

744
00:41:55,842 --> 00:41:59,709
"Offensive and indecent."
Mr. Bennett, I am blushing.

745
00:41:59,711 --> 00:42:02,613
No, I'm blushing.

746
00:42:02,615 --> 00:42:04,314
What do you care
what Bennett thinks?

747
00:42:04,316 --> 00:42:06,249
- He's a prig.
- And a snob.

748
00:42:06,251 --> 00:42:08,418
Yeah, and all the snobs
in New York read him.

749
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:09,855
He does their thinking for them.

750
00:42:09,857 --> 00:42:12,323
Whatever happened to
thriving off controversy?

751
00:42:12,325 --> 00:42:14,192
Yeah, well...
Hey.

752
00:42:14,194 --> 00:42:16,060
- Do you have any thoughts on this?
- Phillip!

753
00:42:16,062 --> 00:42:18,397
You know what?
As a matter of fact, I do.

754
00:42:18,399 --> 00:42:19,665
Helen, come on.

755
00:42:19,667 --> 00:42:20,966
"The Master of the Household

756
00:42:20,968 --> 00:42:22,868
"has it in command
of the Queen

757
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:24,837
"to invite
Mr. Phineas T. Barnum

758
00:42:24,839 --> 00:42:26,171
"and his theatrical troupe

759
00:42:26,173 --> 00:42:29,741
to a reception
at Buckingham Palace."

760
00:42:29,743 --> 00:42:33,044
The Queen Victoria?
Is this real?

761
00:42:33,046 --> 00:42:35,014
I had to pull a few strings.

762
00:42:35,016 --> 00:42:37,284
If you want society
to accept you,

763
00:42:37,286 --> 00:42:38,585
you may as well start...

764
00:42:38,587 --> 00:42:41,357
at the very, very top.

765
00:42:42,358 --> 00:42:43,993
Are we all invited?

766
00:42:52,701 --> 00:42:54,133
I guess I'll just
have to tell the Queen

767
00:42:54,135 --> 00:42:56,070
that either all of us go...

768
00:42:56,871 --> 00:42:58,508
or none of us will.

769
00:43:03,345 --> 00:43:06,315
The Queen of England!
Can't get much better than that.

770
00:43:14,624 --> 00:43:15,890
Why aren't we in tails?

771
00:43:15,892 --> 00:43:17,024
We're the entertainment.

772
00:43:17,026 --> 00:43:19,195
Don't see you in a costume.

773
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:25,934
Your Majesty,
Mr. Phineas T. Barnum...

774
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:30,842
and his Oddities from America!

775
00:43:34,643 --> 00:43:36,413
Is that real?

776
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:53,995
Your Majesty.
May I present Mr. Barnum.

777
00:43:53,997 --> 00:43:56,400
The honor is mine, Mr. Barnum.

778
00:43:57,167 --> 00:43:58,533
And I've heard all about

779
00:43:58,535 --> 00:44:01,539
your little colonel from
my friends in America.

780
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:04,073
General, ma'am.

781
00:44:04,075 --> 00:44:05,908
You're even smaller
than I imagined.

782
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:07,276
Well, you're not exactly

783
00:44:07,278 --> 00:44:09,312
reaching the top shelf
yourself, sweetheart.

784
00:44:31,837 --> 00:44:33,105
That went well.

785
00:44:35,008 --> 00:44:36,774
Your Majesty.

786
00:44:36,776 --> 00:44:38,077
Phillip.

787
00:44:38,479 --> 00:44:40,180
Miss Jenny Lind.

788
00:44:43,617 --> 00:44:46,220
She is luminous.

789
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:50,021
Who's that?

790
00:44:50,023 --> 00:44:51,925
The opera singer?

791
00:44:52,593 --> 00:44:53,928
Singer, huh?

792
00:44:55,061 --> 00:44:58,129
She's the most famous performer
in all of Europe.

793
00:44:58,131 --> 00:45:00,833
She's sold out
La Scala a dozen times.

794
00:45:00,835 --> 00:45:03,371
Not to mention
the French Opera.

795
00:45:07,674 --> 00:45:08,943
Ah.

796
00:45:09,777 --> 00:45:11,076
What are you doing?

797
00:45:11,078 --> 00:45:13,112
Following you, so you can
introduce me to Miss Lind.

798
00:45:13,114 --> 00:45:15,112
- Introduce you? I don't know her.
- Yeah.

799
00:45:15,114 --> 00:45:16,582
Everybody knows her.
You just said so yourself.

800
00:45:16,584 --> 00:45:18,449
Yeah, exactly. You don't just
march up to someone like this.

801
00:45:18,451 --> 00:45:20,219
Why not? We're personable.
She's a person.

802
00:45:23,726 --> 00:45:25,126
Miss Lind.

803
00:45:25,827 --> 00:45:27,563
My name is Phillip Carlyle.

804
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:32,532
And this extraordinary gentleman
next to me...

805
00:45:32,534 --> 00:45:34,032
Phineas Taylor Barnum.

806
00:45:34,034 --> 00:45:35,168
The pleasure's mine.

807
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:36,470
Of course,
you are the American.

808
00:45:36,472 --> 00:45:39,238
I believe I might
have heard of you.

809
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,740
Oh, well, if you've heard of me
all the way over here

810
00:45:41,742 --> 00:45:43,809
I must be doing something right.

811
00:45:43,811 --> 00:45:46,180
That, or something very wrong.

812
00:45:46,182 --> 00:45:49,084
Well, in the world of publicity,
there's hardly a difference.

813
00:45:49,086 --> 00:45:52,319
I believe those are the words
of a scoundrel, Mr. Barnum.

814
00:45:52,321 --> 00:45:55,156
A showman, Miss Lind,
just a showman.

815
00:45:55,158 --> 00:45:57,424
The best on my side
of the Atlantic.

816
00:45:57,426 --> 00:45:59,859
Well, if you do
say so yourself.

817
00:45:59,861 --> 00:46:03,096
I do, but I don't have to.

818
00:46:03,098 --> 00:46:04,165
- Oh, no. No.
- Right?

819
00:46:04,167 --> 00:46:06,167
No, he is one of the best.

820
00:46:06,169 --> 00:46:08,201
Oh, that's very kind of you.
Miss Lind...

821
00:46:08,203 --> 00:46:09,371
let me get to the point.

822
00:46:09,373 --> 00:46:10,806
I'd like to bring you
to New York.

823
00:46:10,808 --> 00:46:13,141
And if you agree, I'll make you
the most famous singer

824
00:46:13,143 --> 00:46:15,344
not in Europe,
but in the entire world.

825
00:46:15,346 --> 00:46:16,978
Mmm.

826
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:19,181
And have you heard me sing?

827
00:46:19,183 --> 00:46:22,050
- Absolutely.
- No. No, I haven't.

828
00:46:22,052 --> 00:46:24,853
But like mine,
your reputation precedes you,

829
00:46:24,855 --> 00:46:26,787
and, well,
I trust your reputation

830
00:46:26,789 --> 00:46:28,824
more than my own taste, so...

831
00:46:28,826 --> 00:46:31,527
I've never been to America.

832
00:46:31,529 --> 00:46:33,263
You will sing
in the grandest theater

833
00:46:33,265 --> 00:46:35,999
with the finest orchestra
in the greatest city on Earth.

834
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,633
"Jenny Lind.

835
00:46:37,635 --> 00:46:38,933
"One night only."

836
00:46:38,935 --> 00:46:40,169
Or maybe two.

837
00:46:40,171 --> 00:46:42,605
And at 20 percent of the gate,

838
00:46:42,607 --> 00:46:44,406
it'll be a queen's ransom
for your efforts.

839
00:46:44,408 --> 00:46:46,776
I give most of my earnings
to charity, Mr. Barnum.

840
00:46:46,778 --> 00:46:48,044
To orphans and widows.

841
00:46:48,046 --> 00:46:50,680
"Voice of a Nightingale,
Heart of an Angel."

842
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:51,714
That's brilliant.

843
00:46:51,716 --> 00:46:53,216
I mean, the press
will go crazy for that story.

844
00:46:53,218 --> 00:46:54,817
That's not a story.

845
00:46:54,819 --> 00:46:56,819
May I ask you something,
Mr. Barnum?

846
00:46:56,821 --> 00:46:58,257
Anything.

847
00:46:59,592 --> 00:47:00,627
Why me?

848
00:47:03,228 --> 00:47:04,494
People come to my show

849
00:47:04,496 --> 00:47:07,465
for the pleasure
of being hoodwinked.

850
00:47:07,467 --> 00:47:09,836
Just once, I'd love to give them
something real.

851
00:47:16,241 --> 00:47:17,776
Miss Lind.

852
00:47:29,856 --> 00:47:32,691
Everyone is here.
Look at this.

853
00:47:32,693 --> 00:47:34,294
Even the Winthrops.

854
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:36,396
Are you happy?

855
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:39,263
I will be if this works.

856
00:47:39,265 --> 00:47:42,136
Oh, God. I hope she can sing.

857
00:47:44,037 --> 00:47:45,237
What's taking her so long?

858
00:47:45,239 --> 00:47:46,971
They're still
taking their seats.

859
00:47:46,973 --> 00:47:48,273
- Speaking of which.
- Yeah?

860
00:47:48,275 --> 00:47:50,076
Tom and Lettie, the others,
they've just arrived.

861
00:47:50,078 --> 00:47:51,311
What?

862
00:47:51,313 --> 00:47:53,344
Where should I put 'em?
Your box?

863
00:47:53,346 --> 00:47:55,648
That box? No, no, no,
that's a bit visible.

864
00:47:55,650 --> 00:47:56,782
Visible?

865
00:47:56,784 --> 00:47:58,317
The acoustics are actually
better in the standing room.

866
00:47:58,319 --> 00:47:59,521
That's where they should be.

867
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,121
Miss Lind's ready now.

868
00:48:02,123 --> 00:48:03,592
Okay. Thank you, thank God!

869
00:48:05,594 --> 00:48:07,226
This is so awesome.

870
00:48:07,228 --> 00:48:09,495
- Isn't it wonderful?
- Yeah.

871
00:48:09,497 --> 00:48:11,399
- I love it.
- Look at the curtain.

872
00:48:24,747 --> 00:48:27,280
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for your patience.

873
00:48:27,282 --> 00:48:29,082
He's out of his element.

874
00:48:29,084 --> 00:48:30,816
What is this about?

875
00:48:30,818 --> 00:48:32,385
Is that Barnum?

876
00:48:32,387 --> 00:48:33,756
This isn't the circus.

877
00:48:34,725 --> 00:48:36,558
I recently had the privilege

878
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:40,295
of hearing the most
divine voice

879
00:48:40,297 --> 00:48:41,429
I've ever heard.

880
00:48:41,431 --> 00:48:43,297
Suddenly,
he's a connoisseur.

881
00:48:43,299 --> 00:48:46,600
Now, I know that
sounds like Barnum Humbug...

882
00:48:46,602 --> 00:48:48,735
but I have 100 bottles
of good champagne on ice

883
00:48:48,737 --> 00:48:51,272
that says this isn't just
another sideshow novelty.

884
00:48:54,111 --> 00:48:55,777
May I present...

885
00:48:55,779 --> 00:48:57,548
the Swedish Nightingale...

886
00:48:58,249 --> 00:48:59,914

Brava!

More!

940
00:52:54,126 --> 00:52:55,494
Wonderful!

941
00:52:56,128 --> 00:52:57,631
Bravissima!

942
00:52:58,265 --> 00:52:59,600
More!

943
00:53:00,234 --> 00:53:01,134
Excellent!

944
00:53:03,536 --> 00:53:04,605
Brava!

945
00:53:06,707 --> 00:53:07,538
Encore!

946
00:53:11,779 --> 00:53:13,645
Jenny, this is my wife,
Charity, and our girls.

947
00:53:13,647 --> 00:53:15,714
Of course, and I've heard
so much about you!

948
00:53:15,716 --> 00:53:18,549
And your father tells me
you're a fan of the ballet.

949
00:53:18,551 --> 00:53:20,317
Yes, I'm studying ballet.

950
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:21,887
Are you?

951
00:53:21,889 --> 00:53:24,490
- Of course, I am.
- And, of course, she is.

952
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:25,624
And what
about you, Helen?

953
00:53:25,626 --> 00:53:27,260
You look like
a princess, ma'am.

954
00:53:28,429 --> 00:53:32,898
I have to admit, Barnum...
she is remarkable.

955
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:35,635
Enough to bring joy to the most
joyless critic, isn't she?

956
00:53:35,637 --> 00:53:38,972
Mmm. And in the hands of a
real purveyor of the arts,

957
00:53:38,974 --> 00:53:42,307
she could be something in this country.

958
00:53:42,309 --> 00:53:44,410
Shame,
she's fallen in with you.

959
00:53:44,412 --> 00:53:46,379
You really are better
on the page, Mr. Bennett,

960
00:53:46,381 --> 00:53:47,781
hard as that is to believe.

961
00:53:47,783 --> 00:53:49,248
- Mr. Barnum...
- Yes.

962
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:50,783
- I'd love to meet Miss Lind.
- And you will meet Miss Lind.

963
00:53:50,785 --> 00:53:52,620
- Would you introduce us?
- If you just give me a moment...

964
00:53:52,622 --> 00:53:54,321
- Phineas.
- Yes.

965
00:53:54,323 --> 00:53:55,890
You've...

966
00:53:55,892 --> 00:53:57,694
done well.

967
00:53:59,261 --> 00:54:00,697
Thank you.

968
00:54:03,665 --> 00:54:05,567
Allow me to introduce you.

969
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:09,704
Uh, excuse me, Jenny.

970
00:54:09,706 --> 00:54:12,407
I'd like you to meet
Charity's parents.

971
00:54:12,409 --> 00:54:13,874
Mr. and Mrs. Hallett.

972
00:54:13,876 --> 00:54:15,110
Ah, pleasure.

973
00:54:15,112 --> 00:54:17,211
- How do you do? Very nice to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

974
00:54:17,213 --> 00:54:19,547
- Mother.
- Hello, dear.

975
00:54:19,549 --> 00:54:22,349
Are these...

976
00:54:22,351 --> 00:54:24,085
Yes, those are
your granddaughters.

977
00:54:24,087 --> 00:54:25,253
Phineas, not here.

978
00:54:25,255 --> 00:54:26,253
Not here?

979
00:54:26,255 --> 00:54:27,787
You afraid I'm gonna
embarrass your parents

980
00:54:27,789 --> 00:54:29,824
in front of their fancy friends?

981
00:54:29,826 --> 00:54:31,592
I really don't think
I have that power.

982
00:54:31,594 --> 00:54:33,895
An insignificant man like me

983
00:54:33,897 --> 00:54:38,066
who was clearly destined
to lead an insignificant life.

984
00:54:38,068 --> 00:54:41,272
All that fortune,
and still just the tailor's boy.

985
00:54:42,305 --> 00:54:43,742
Get out.

986
00:54:48,178 --> 00:54:50,912
Well, Phineas...

987
00:54:50,914 --> 00:54:53,682
I believe I told you
that free champagne

988
00:54:53,684 --> 00:54:55,220
is a recipe for disaster.

989
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:57,286
Charity.

990
00:54:57,288 --> 00:55:01,291
- Now would everyone please raise their glasses?
- Charity.

991
00:55:01,293 --> 00:55:02,625
To Mr. Barnum...

992
00:55:02,627 --> 00:55:04,427
who has shown
once and for all...

993
00:55:04,429 --> 00:55:07,230
that a man's station
is limited only

994
00:55:07,232 --> 00:55:08,833
by his imagination.

995
00:55:10,668 --> 00:55:13,137
- To Barnum! To Barnum!
- Thank you.

996
00:55:13,139 --> 00:55:14,106
To Mr. Barnum.

997
00:55:17,509 --> 00:55:19,576
Thank you.

998
00:55:19,578 --> 00:55:22,213
It's hard to understand
wealth and privilege

999
00:55:22,215 --> 00:55:24,214
when you're born into it.

1000
00:55:26,019 --> 00:55:29,323
I sometimes don't feel
like I belong here.

1001
00:55:30,456 --> 00:55:32,024
You?

1002
00:55:33,193 --> 00:55:35,859
I was born out of wedlock...

1003
00:55:35,861 --> 00:55:38,130
and that brought
shame upon my family.

1004
00:55:38,999 --> 00:55:40,964
And life always
manages to remind me

1005
00:55:40,966 --> 00:55:42,367
that I don't deserve
a place in this world.

1006
00:55:42,369 --> 00:55:47,007
And that leaves a hole that
no ovation can ever fill.

1007
00:55:52,946 --> 00:55:54,279
- Mr. Phineas!
- Guys...

1008
00:55:54,281 --> 00:55:56,047
Lord, that lady can sing!

1009
00:55:56,049 --> 00:55:56,949
I know.

1010
00:55:56,951 --> 00:55:58,984
Think she likes a man
in uniform?

1011
00:55:58,986 --> 00:56:00,719
I'm sure she does.
Okay, what are you doing here?

1012
00:56:00,721 --> 00:56:02,286
You got a show
in an hour, okay?

1013
00:56:02,288 --> 00:56:04,322
That's enough time for us to have
at least three drinks, right?

1014
00:56:04,324 --> 00:56:05,489
Come on, let's go.

1015
00:56:05,491 --> 00:56:07,025
- No, no, no. Lettie!
- What?

1016
00:56:07,027 --> 00:56:09,863
It's very crowded in here, okay?
And I can't have you mingling...

1017
00:56:09,865 --> 00:56:10,729
Guys!

1018
00:56:10,731 --> 00:56:11,898
Who's gonna pay admission

1019
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:13,365
if you're out there
for all the world to see?

1020
00:56:13,367 --> 00:56:15,501
- Okay? Have a great show.
- Wait.

1021
00:56:15,503 --> 00:56:17,470
Ladies and gentlemen, a toast!

1022
00:56:17,472 --> 00:56:20,407
Jenny, America
may not know it yet...

1023
00:56:20,409 --> 00:56:22,407
but they are going to love you.

1024
00:56:22,409 --> 00:56:24,209

Why can't you just
put more shows in New York?

1110
01:00:13,919 --> 01:00:15,118
Why do you need
to tour the country?

1111
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:17,620
Why did Napoleon
march on Russia?

1112
01:00:17,622 --> 01:00:18,821
Napoleon was defeated.

1113
01:00:18,823 --> 01:00:21,056
Napoleon didn't have
a 60-piece orchestra.

1114
01:00:21,058 --> 01:00:22,525
A 60-piece orchestra?

1115
01:00:22,527 --> 01:00:25,027
Just get the cheapest musicians
you can and watch that.

1116
01:00:25,029 --> 01:00:26,263
We'll still have to board them.

1117
01:00:26,265 --> 01:00:27,496
We'll get married ones,
they can share a bunk.

1118
01:00:27,498 --> 01:00:29,632
O'Malley, that's
Caroline's piggy bank.

1119
01:00:29,634 --> 01:00:32,503
- Custom sets? Fireworks?
- Yeah.

1120
01:00:32,505 --> 01:00:33,936
Inside theaters?

1121
01:00:33,938 --> 01:00:35,273
That's genius.

1122
01:00:35,275 --> 01:00:36,572
No. Hey, P.T...

1123
01:00:36,574 --> 01:00:38,441
These are the most
famous theaters in the country.

1124
01:00:38,443 --> 01:00:40,443
They make you buy the seats
in advance just to book them.

1125
01:00:40,445 --> 01:00:41,845
Yeah. I took out a loan.

1126
01:00:41,847 --> 01:00:44,414
- And we have to pay Jenny in advance?
- It was a large loan. Okay?

1127
01:00:44,416 --> 01:00:46,015
You're not gonna see
a penny of profit

1128
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:47,517
until your 40th show...

1129
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:48,686
41st, actually.

1130
01:00:48,688 --> 01:00:50,220
You're risking everything
you've built here.

1131
01:00:50,222 --> 01:00:51,555
How do you think I built it?

1132
01:00:51,557 --> 01:00:53,423
We'll have plenty of profits
to go around after this.

1133
01:00:53,425 --> 01:00:54,390
- P.T.?
- What?

1134
01:00:54,392 --> 01:00:56,728
Your attention has been
divided long enough.

1135
01:00:56,730 --> 01:00:57,861
Our gate is down,

1136
01:00:57,863 --> 01:00:59,263
we have more
protesters every day.

1137
01:00:59,265 --> 01:01:00,665
You just need to get people
to come back.

1138
01:01:00,667 --> 01:01:02,734
"If you haven't been
to the Barnum Museum lately,

1139
01:01:02,736 --> 01:01:04,134
you haven't been
at the Barnum Museum."

1140
01:01:04,136 --> 01:01:06,138
They come to see you.

1141
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:07,872
Your crazy ideas...

1142
01:01:07,874 --> 01:01:10,140
your new acts, the unusual.

1143
01:01:10,142 --> 01:01:12,977
Then how about you show
them a smile? That'd be unusual.

1144
01:01:12,979 --> 01:01:14,346
Keep rehearsing.
Just make it very clear

1145
01:01:14,348 --> 01:01:16,915
I expect them to afford you
all the deference you deserve

1146
01:01:16,917 --> 01:01:19,951
and that they should
be nice to you anyway.

1147
01:01:19,953 --> 01:01:22,220
Ain't that a
sight for sore eyes?

1148
01:01:22,222 --> 01:01:23,789
He couldn't even say "hello."

1149
01:01:23,791 --> 01:01:24,923
Or "goodbye."

1150
01:01:24,925 --> 01:01:27,325
He's going on tour. Sorry, guys.

1151
01:01:27,327 --> 01:01:29,095
Oh, pull yourself
together, Carlyle.

1152
01:01:29,097 --> 01:01:31,032
Don't you have
somewhere to be?

1153
01:01:36,538 --> 01:01:37,836
Anne Wheeler.

1154
01:01:37,838 --> 01:01:40,575
Mr. Barnum said
he left a ticket for me.

1155
01:01:44,847 --> 01:01:46,279
I'm sorry.

1156
01:01:46,281 --> 01:01:48,113
I believe there's only
supposed to be one.

1157
01:01:48,115 --> 01:01:50,518
No, there's meant to be two.

1158
01:01:55,357 --> 01:01:58,094
I wasn't sure
you'd come if I asked.

1159
01:02:02,129 --> 01:02:03,732
Five minutes to curtain.

1160
01:02:06,502 --> 01:02:08,438
I've always wanted
to go to the theater.

1161
01:02:15,078 --> 01:02:17,179
Phillip, is that you?

1162
01:02:18,346 --> 01:02:19,380
Mother.

1163
01:02:19,382 --> 01:02:23,520
Father.
This is Anne Wheeler.

1164
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:27,554
Phillip, have you no shame?

1165
01:02:27,556 --> 01:02:31,324
Associating yourself with that
Barnum business is one thing...

1166
01:02:31,326 --> 01:02:33,497
but parading around
with the help?

1167
01:02:36,466 --> 01:02:38,366
Anne.

1168
01:02:38,368 --> 01:02:39,734
Anne!

1169
01:02:39,736 --> 01:02:41,039
Anne!

1170
01:02:46,175 --> 01:02:48,345
How dare you speak
to her like that?

1171
01:02:50,814 --> 01:02:52,881
You forget your place, Phillip.

1172
01:02:52,883 --> 01:02:54,915
My place?

1173
01:02:54,917 --> 01:02:56,953
Mother, if this is my place,

1174
01:02:56,955 --> 01:02:59,123
then I don't
want any part of it.

1175
01:03:08,667 --> 01:03:10,302
Anne.

1176
01:03:14,205 --> 01:03:16,241
They're small-minded people.

1177
01:03:22,881 --> 01:03:24,347
Why do you care what they think?

1178
01:03:24,349 --> 01:03:26,518
It's not just them.

1179
01:03:27,452 --> 01:03:29,318
You've never had
somebody look at you

1180
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:31,156
the way your parents
looked at me.

1181
01:03:32,992 --> 01:03:35,195

01:07:32,841 --> 01:07:35,842
First, it was buying a house on
the same street as my parents.

1241
01:07:35,844 --> 01:07:37,043
Then, meeting the Queen.

1242
01:07:37,045 --> 01:07:40,580
Then bringing Jenny Lind,
then my father the other night.

1243
01:07:40,582 --> 01:07:42,819
When will it ever
be enough for you?

1244
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:46,488
I'm doing this
for Caroline and Helen.

1245
01:07:46,490 --> 01:07:48,555
Look around you.
They have everything.

1246
01:07:48,557 --> 01:07:50,157
- You don't understand.
- I do understand.

1247
01:07:50,159 --> 01:07:51,928
No, you don't understand.

1248
01:07:53,063 --> 01:07:54,765
How could you?

1249
01:07:57,300 --> 01:07:59,767
My father was treated like dirt.

1250
01:07:59,769 --> 01:08:04,305
I was treated like dirt,
and my children will not be.

1251
01:08:04,307 --> 01:08:06,809
You don't need everyone
to love you, Phin.

1252
01:08:08,444 --> 01:08:11,749
Just a few good people.

1253
01:08:13,850 --> 01:08:15,419
I know that.

1254
01:08:24,796 --> 01:08:25,930

the world, haven't I?

I, uh, I should go.

I've become a distraction.
I'm sorry, Jenny.

1382
01:16:59,731 --> 01:17:01,301
Here she is! Here she is!

1383
01:17:04,070 --> 01:17:05,368
Phillip!

1384
01:17:05,370 --> 01:17:07,006
- Phillip!
- Daddy!

1385
01:17:10,609 --> 01:17:11,977
- No, Daddy!
- Daddy!

1386
01:17:12,744 --> 01:17:13,947
Daddy!

1387
01:17:25,858 --> 01:17:27,460
Stay back! Please!

1388
01:17:38,906 --> 01:17:40,207
Daddy!

1389
01:17:47,581 --> 01:17:48,984
Stretcher!

1390
01:17:49,415 --> 01:17:50,718
Stretcher!

1391
01:17:51,751 --> 01:17:52,918
He's taken a lot of smoke.

1392
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:55,454
He's still breathing. Come on.

1393
01:17:55,456 --> 01:17:56,821
Come on, let's get him on!

Come on! Straight ahead!

1401
01:19:18,174 --> 01:19:20,312
Thomas, help me break this up.

1402
01:19:33,291 --> 01:19:36,094
If you've come to gloat,
I wouldn't.

1403
01:19:40,231 --> 01:19:43,299
They caught the thugs
who started the fire.

1404
01:19:43,301 --> 01:19:45,804
I thought you'd like to know.

1405
01:19:55,947 --> 01:19:59,049
I never liked your show.

1406
01:19:59,051 --> 01:20:00,886
But I always thought
the people did.

1407
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:03,823
They did. They do.

1408
01:20:11,899 --> 01:20:13,633
Mind you,
I wouldn't call it art.

1409
01:20:14,835 --> 01:20:16,367
Of course not.

1410
01:20:16,369 --> 01:20:17,637
But...

1411
01:20:19,171 --> 01:20:23,174
putting folks of all kinds
on stage with you...

1412
01:20:23,176 --> 01:20:27,111
all colors, shapes, sizes...

1413
01:20:27,113 --> 01:20:29,415
presenting them as equals...

1414
01:20:30,582 --> 01:20:34,120
Why, another critic
might have even called it

1415
01:20:34,122 --> 01:20:36,458
"a celebration of humanity."

1416
01:20:38,124 --> 01:20:39,858
I would've liked that.

1417
01:20:39,860 --> 01:20:41,428
Mmm.

1418
01:20:44,231 --> 01:20:46,433
- Well, I hope you'll rebuild.
- Hmm.

1419
01:20:47,634 --> 01:20:49,501
I mean, thank God
for Jenny's tour.

1420
01:20:49,503 --> 01:20:51,472
We can borrow off the profits,
we'll be fine.

1421
01:20:52,006 --> 01:20:53,038
You don't know?

1422
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:54,543
Hmm?

1423
01:21:02,050 --> 01:21:03,652
I'm sorry.

1424
01:21:14,763 --> 01:21:16,063
Charity?

1425
01:21:16,065 --> 01:21:17,697
Oh, God, Charity.

1426
01:21:17,699 --> 01:21:19,132
- I don't wanna talk to you.
- I am...

1427
01:21:19,134 --> 01:21:20,368
Nothing happened.

1428
01:21:20,370 --> 01:21:21,602
- This is ridiculous.
- Oh, sure. Nothing happened.

1429
01:21:21,604 --> 01:21:23,169
It's on the cover
of every paper in New York.

1430
01:21:23,171 --> 01:21:25,739
Because she orchestrated the photo.
I'm not in love with her!

1431
01:21:25,741 --> 01:21:27,275
Of course you're not.

1432
01:21:27,277 --> 01:21:29,711
Not with her, not with me,
not with anyone.

1433
01:21:29,713 --> 01:21:30,981
Just you and your show.

1434
01:21:33,383 --> 01:21:35,385
What are you doing?

1435
01:21:36,819 --> 01:21:38,686
I'm going home.

1436
01:21:38,688 --> 01:21:39,957
This is your home.

1437
01:21:43,927 --> 01:21:45,296
The bank...

1438
01:21:47,098 --> 01:21:48,699
they're evicting us.

1439
01:21:50,434 --> 01:21:52,869
Why didn't you ask me before...

1440
01:21:55,073 --> 01:21:57,339
I would've said yes.

1441
01:21:57,341 --> 01:22:00,778
I never minded the risk,
but we always did it together.

1442
01:22:39,151 --> 01:22:41,184
Figured you'd end up here.

1443
01:22:41,186 --> 01:22:42,952
Feeling sorry for yourself.

1444
01:22:59,305 --> 01:23:00,971
Folks, if you've
come to get paid,

1445
01:23:00,973 --> 01:23:03,574
the money is gone. All of it.

1446
01:23:03,576 --> 01:23:05,476
- Nothing left to give you.
- Shut up, Barnum.

1447
01:23:05,478 --> 01:23:07,414
You just don't get it.

1448
01:23:08,415 --> 01:23:11,452
Our own mothers
were ashamed of us.

1449
01:23:12,552 --> 01:23:14,088
Hid us our whole lives.

1450
01:23:15,421 --> 01:23:18,524
Then you pull us
out of the shadows.

1451
01:23:18,526 --> 01:23:20,495
And now you're
giving up on us, too.

1452
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:23,762
Maybe you are a fraud.

1453
01:23:23,764 --> 01:23:26,600
Maybe it was just
about making a buck.

1454
01:23:28,702 --> 01:23:31,838
But you gave us a real family.

1455
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:35,410
And the circus...
that was our home.

1456
01:23:39,113 --> 01:23:40,848
We want our home back.

01:30:58,905 --> 01:31:00,938
I don't think there's a banker
left in the country

1554
01:31:00,940 --> 01:31:04,443
I can fool into loaning me
more money, so...

1555
01:31:06,813 --> 01:31:08,446
I'm really sorry
to disappoint you all.

1556
01:31:08,448 --> 01:31:11,916
Don't worry, Barnum.
We've gotten used to it by now.

1557
01:31:11,918 --> 01:31:13,750
You know, Barnum...

1558
01:31:13,752 --> 01:31:15,753
when I first met you...

1559
01:31:15,755 --> 01:31:17,921
I had an inheritance, acclaim,

1560
01:31:17,923 --> 01:31:20,893
an invitation
to every party in town.

1561
01:31:20,895 --> 01:31:24,399
And now, thanks to you,
all that's gone.

1562
01:31:25,967 --> 01:31:27,165
All that's left is

1563
01:31:27,167 --> 01:31:31,604
friendship, love,
and work that I adore.

1564
01:31:34,107 --> 01:31:37,076
You brought joy into my life.

1565
01:31:37,078 --> 01:31:39,180
- Into all our lives.
- Hear, hear.

1566
01:31:41,048 --> 01:31:43,582
If only the bank
would take joy as collateral.

1567
01:31:43,584 --> 01:31:45,119
They may not...

1568
01:31:45,754 --> 01:31:47,289
but I will.

1569
01:31:48,723 --> 01:31:50,592
I own 10% of the show.

1570
01:31:52,259 --> 01:31:54,026
Knowing who I was working for...

1571
01:31:54,028 --> 01:31:56,464
I had the good sense
to take my cut weekly.

1572
01:31:58,266 --> 01:32:00,434
Phillip, I can't let you
gamble it on me.

1573
01:32:00,436 --> 01:32:02,101
Sure you can.

1574
01:32:02,103 --> 01:32:04,539
Don't turn
sensible on us now.

1575
01:32:05,740 --> 01:32:07,176
Partners.

1576
01:32:08,443 --> 01:32:09,612
50-50.

1577
01:32:21,423 --> 01:32:22,425
Partners.

1578
01:32:23,225 --> 01:32:24,624
Yeah!

1579
01:32:24,626 --> 01:32:26,427
The only thing is,

1580
01:32:26,429 --> 01:32:28,465
I don't know how
we're gonna afford a building.

1581
01:32:29,898 --> 01:32:31,368
Right.

1582
01:32:34,971 --> 01:32:37,239
Building.
We don't need a building.

1583
01:32:37,241 --> 01:32:39,607
Real estate in Manhattan
is a terrible investment.

1584
01:32:39,609 --> 01:32:43,445
Why, I can get land down by
the docks for almost nothing!

1585
01:32:43,447 --> 01:32:45,879
All we need is a tent.
