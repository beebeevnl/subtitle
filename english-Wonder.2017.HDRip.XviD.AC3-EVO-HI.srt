in a car crash or something?

150
00:09:26,789 --> 00:09:28,022
Julian!

151
00:09:28,024 --> 00:09:30,425
What? Tushman said we could
ask questions if we wanted to.

152
00:09:30,427 --> 00:09:31,425
Not rude questions.

153
00:09:31,427 --> 00:09:34,161
Besides, he was born
like that, Mr. Tushman said.

154
00:09:34,163 --> 00:09:37,931
Yeah, I know. I just thought maybe
he was, like, in a fire, too.

155
00:09:37,933 --> 00:09:39,800
Hey, Julian, shut up.

156
00:09:39,802 --> 00:09:40,868
You shut up!

157
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:41,938
Why don't we all shut up?

158
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,209
No, I wasn't in a fire.

159
00:09:48,144 --> 00:09:49,879
And the word's "supposedly."

160
00:09:51,881 --> 00:09:53,180
What?

161
00:09:53,182 --> 00:09:57,252
You said that science
is supposably really hard.

162
00:09:57,254 --> 00:09:59,286
Twice.

163
00:09:59,288 --> 00:10:02,158
The word's "supposedly."
With a "D."

164
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,097
Maybe my mom
can home school you, too.

165
00:10:20,943 --> 00:10:24,546
Do you wanna tell us yet
how you felt about the tour?

166
00:10:24,548 --> 00:10:25,847
Today?

167
00:10:25,849 --> 00:10:27,415
Mr. Tushman
went out of his way

168
00:10:27,417 --> 00:10:29,217
to tell me how sweet
those kids were

169
00:10:29,219 --> 00:10:32,355

one way in front of grownups

173
00:10:39,028 --> 00:10:41,228
and then another way
in front of kids?

174
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,930
Yeah, I guess.

175
00:10:42,932 --> 00:10:46,434
Well I know it's hard, but
you have to understand that

176
00:10:46,436 --> 00:10:49,337
he probably feels badly
about himself.

177
00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:53,340
And when someone acts small, you just
have to be the bigger person, all right?

178
00:10:53,342 --> 00:10:55,478
Right.

302
00:17:49,259 --> 00:17:53,995
And I just said three things.
Yeah. Sorry.

303
00:17:53,997 --> 00:17:56,330
That sounds like a bonus
to me. Three things.

304
00:17:56,332 --> 00:17:58,966
Thank you very much, Auggie,
that was perfect. Who's next?

305

Oh! I actually have
a question for Auggie.

306
00:18:02,971 --> 00:18:05,439
What's the deal with the braid
in the back of your hair?

307
00:18:05,441 --> 00:18:07,440
Is it like a Padawan thing?

308
00:18:07,442 --> 00:18:09,309
What's a Padawan thing?

309
00:18:09,311 --> 00:18:12,848
Oh. It's from <i>Star Wars.</i>
Padawan is a Jedi apprentice.

310

Who's your favorite character,
Auggie?

311
00:18:16,451 --> 00:18:17,884
Boba Fett.

312
00:18:17,886 --> 00:18:19,956
What about Darth Sidious?
Do you like him?

313
00:18:25,327 --> 00:18:26,594
Ouch.

314
00:18:26,596 --> 00:18:30,463
Okay, can we talk about
<i>Star Wars</i> at recess? Yes?

315
00:18:30,465 --> 00:18:33,366

Good.

Good how?
Good like it was good?

372
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:57,163
Or good like it was bad and
you just don't wanna tell us?

373

It was good, okay?
I just don't know

It was good!

Okay, okay, hey!
If you're mad at Mom

376
00:23:02,738 --> 00:23:04,604
about going to school,
it was my idea, too.

377
00:23:04,606 --> 00:23:06,942
Why can't I just say "good"

You are not ugly, Auggie.

389

761
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,633
There are no nice ones!

762
00:48:35,635 --> 00:48:38,304
I wish I'd never gone
to school in the first place!

763
00:48:38,306 --> 00:48:40,673
But you were liking school.
I know you were.

764
00:48:40,675 --> 00:48:42,711
I hate it, okay? I hate it.

765
00:48:46,646 --> 00:48:51,182
Auggie, I'm sorry, but you're not
the only one who has bad days.

766
00:48:51,184 --> 00:48:55,387
Bad days?
Do people avoid touching you?

767
00:48:55,389 --> 00:48:58,693
When a person accidentally touches
you, do they call it "the plague"?

768
00:48:59,494 --> 00:49:00,659
No.

769
00:49:00,661 --> 00:49:01,927
Jack Will was all I had.

770
00:49:01,929 --> 00:49:05,664
So just don't compare your bad
days at school to mine, okay?

771
00:49:05,666 --> 00:49:06,701
Okay.

772
00:49:12,773 --> 00:49:14,039
Hey.

773
00:49:14,041 --> 00:49:17,175
Did you notice that Miranda
doesn't come around any more?

774
00:49:17,177 --> 00:49:18,376
What?

775
00:49:18,378 --> 00:49:20,714
You didn't. Shocker.

776
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,617
Yeah she went away
to camp this summer

777
00:49:24,619 --> 00:49:26,719
and now
she doesn't like me anymore.

778
00:49:26,721 --> 00:49:27,722
Why?

779
00:49:28,722 --> 00:49:31,293
Because school sucks.

780
00:49:32,226 --> 00:49:34,325
And people change.

781
00:49:34,327 --> 00:49:37,865
So if you wanna be a normal kid,
Auggie, then those are the rules.

782
00:49:39,199 --> 00:49:42,403
So let's go trick-or-treating.

783

784
00:49:45,206 --> 00:49:49,177

each other's best friends.

That one note was on the back

1378

Your son photoshopped
Auggie out of it.

then I guess I will.

- Sarah.

1393

We had to take him
to a child psychologist

with his night terrors.

1395

good works come in many forms.

"lies not in being strong

"but in the right using
of strength.
