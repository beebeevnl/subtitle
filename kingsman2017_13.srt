1
0:0:2.180 --> 0:0:3.548
You just made it personal.

2
0:0:6.517 --> 0:0:8.285
(GRUNTING)

3
0:0:12.590 --> 0:0:13.592
(GROANS)

4
0:0:19.963 --> 0:0:21.265
(BEEPING)

5
0:0:22.700 --> 0:0:24.235
(PANTING)

6
0:0:24.267 --> 0:0:26.537
Who the fuck are you?

7
0:0:37.081 --> 0:0:39.284
MAN: A bottle
in a secret wall.

8
0:0:40.818 --> 0:0:43.021
You really expect me
to take that seriously?

9
0:0:44.488 --> 0:0:46.390
See, I think
your story's horse shit.

10
0:0:46.423 --> 0:0:49.860
Y'all just trying to cover
for a failed rescue mission.

11
0:0:49.894 --> 0:0:52.430
You here for the lepidopterist,
ain't you?

12
0:0:56.534 --> 0:0:58.970
Okay, so your
mystery bottle, huh?

13
0:1:1.673 --> 0:1:3.073
Look anything like that,
right there?

14
0:1:3.106 --> 0:1:5.376
Yes. Same brand,
much older.

15
0:1:5.910 --> 0:1:6.911
All right.

16
0:1:8.412 --> 0:1:9.713
Let's see here.

17
0:1:11.048 --> 0:1:12.283
You know why the measurement

18
0:1:12.316 --> 0:1:15.352
of alcohol content's
called "proof"?

19
0:1:15.387 --> 0:1:16.754
Oh, fuck off!

20
0:1:16.787 --> 0:1:19.622
Oh, for Pete's sake.

21
0:1:19.657 --> 0:1:21.492
See, comes from back
in the old days...

22
0:1:21.526 --> 0:1:24.062
when pirates wanted to test
the strength of their rum.

23
0:1:24.095 --> 0:1:26.497
They used to pour a little bit out
on gunpowder.

24
0:1:28.900 --> 0:1:30.068
(EXHALES)

25
0:1:30.101 --> 0:1:32.369
That'll make you wanna slap
your mama right there, boy.

26
0:1:33.871 --> 0:1:34.771
And if the gunpowder,

27
0:1:34.805 --> 0:1:36.441
if it burnt when
they set it alight...

28
0:1:36.474 --> 0:1:38.176
they considered it proof...

29
0:1:38.209 --> 0:1:40.412
that their rum
was good and strong.

30
0:1:42.345 --> 0:1:44.882
But see, I ain't got
no gunpowder on me, do I?

31
0:1:46.818 --> 0:1:48.119
But I'm pretty sure
you boys'll make

32
0:1:48.153 --> 0:1:49.986
just as impressive of a sound...

33
0:1:50.019 --> 0:1:51.523
when I set your balls on fire.

34
0:1:54.425 --> 0:1:55.760
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

35
0:1:55.793 --> 0:1:58.162
Or you could just tell me who the fuck
y'all really are...

36
0:1:58.195 --> 0:1:59.329
and how the hell y'all found us.

37
0:1:59.363 --> 0:2:0.798
MERLIN: Look,
for the last time,

38
0:2:0.831 --> 0:2:3.300
we have nothing to protect
but our honor.

39
0:2:3.334 --> 0:2:5.169
So you can take
your cheap horse piss

40
0:2:5.202 --> 0:2:6.371
that you call whiskey...

41
0:2:6.403 --> 0:2:7.938
which, by the way,
is spelled without an "e"...

42
0:2:7.972 --> 0:2:10.408
and is nothing compared
to a single malt scotch...

43
0:2:10.441 --> 0:2:12.711
and you can go fuck yourself.
(CHUCKLES)

44
0:2:13.343 --> 0:2:14.945
(CHUCKLES SARCASTICALLY)

45
0:2:15.479 --> 0:2:16.880
What about you?

46
0:2:16.914 --> 0:2:18.048
Me?
Yeah.

47
0:2:18.082 --> 0:2:20.584
No, I love
a Jack and Coke, bruv.

48
0:2:20.617 --> 0:2:23.688
But I do agree with the part
where you go fuck yourself.

49
0:2:27.659 --> 0:2:28.492
All right.

50
0:2:28.526 --> 0:2:29.594
Y'all ain't got
nothing to protect

51
0:2:29.626 --> 0:2:30.861
other than your honor.

52
0:2:31.996 --> 0:2:34.099
Let's see what happens
when we change things up.

53
0:2:42.206 --> 0:2:43.841
Fuck me.
Harry?

54
0:2:43.874 --> 0:2:45.910
Y'all got three seconds
to tell me the truth.

55
0:2:45.943 --> 0:2:47.044
MERLIN: Wait. No.

56
0:2:47.077 --> 0:2:48.246
No!
Harry!

57
0:2:48.278 --> 0:2:50.180
He can't hear you.
But I can, so talk.

58
0:2:50.213 --> 0:2:52.315
No!
Get down, Harry!

59
0:2:52.349 --> 0:2:54.184
MERLIN: Harry! Harry!
That's two.

60
0:2:54.218 --> 0:2:55.486
Harry!
Harry!

61
0:2:55.519 --> 0:2:57.088
EGGSY: Harry!
Three.

62
0:2:57.121 --> 0:2:58.823
Stop!

63
0:2:59.490 --> 0:3:1.392
Their story checked out.
