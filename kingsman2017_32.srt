1
0:0:0.194 --> 0:0:2.263
If we made it out of here,
he was gonna kill us both!

2
0:0:7.135 --> 0:0:9.671
For fuck's sake, it looks like he wouldn't
have fucking had to!

3
0:0:9.703 --> 0:0:11.139
Oh, ye of little faith.

4
0:0:13.474 --> 0:0:15.310
(EXPLOSION)

5
0:0:32.827 --> 0:0:35.195
This does not mean
you're off the fucking hook!

6
0:0:36.163 --> 0:0:37.632
We need to go dark.

7
0:0:37.664 --> 0:0:38.899
We don't know
who else at Statesman

8
0:0:38.932 --> 0:0:41.401
could be working against us.

9
0:0:41.435 --> 0:0:42.535
Shit! This is all my fault.

10
0:0:42.569 --> 0:0:43.636
You weren't ready for the field

11
0:0:43.671 --> 0:0:44.738
and I pushed for it!

12
0:0:44.771 --> 0:0:45.840
He showed his hand.

13
0:0:45.873 --> 0:0:47.675
You think he'd have let us live?

14
0:0:47.708 --> 0:0:49.709
You should be thanking me
for saving our arses!

15
0:0:49.743 --> 0:0:50.812
Saving our arses?

16
0:0:50.845 --> 0:0:52.380
Try saying that
to fucking Whiskey!

17
0:0:58.019 --> 0:0:59.688
(HISSING)

18
0:1:2.590 --> 0:1:4.993
You are unbelievable!

19
0:1:5.025 --> 0:1:6.894
Merlin, can you hear me?
MERLIN: Yes, Eggsy.

20
0:1:6.927 --> 0:1:8.229
Whiskey's down.
He's been shot.

21
0:1:8.729 --> 0:1:10.131
What happened?

22
0:1:17.003 --> 0:1:19.873
He got caught in the crossfire.

23
0:1:19.907 --> 0:1:21.943
I've applied the alpha gel.
We'll bring him in.

24
0:1:21.975 --> 0:1:23.810
But first, I've gotta find a
way to get back up to that lab

25
0:1:23.845 --> 0:1:25.646
and retrieve more antidote.

26
0:1:25.680 --> 0:1:26.914
(HELICOPTER APPROACHING)

27
0:1:28.349 --> 0:1:31.452
CLARA: Charlie, what's
happening? Where are you?

28
0:1:31.484 --> 0:1:33.086
Everything's under control.

29
0:1:33.119 --> 0:1:35.823
I'm sorry, Charlie.
I'm so sorry.

30
0:1:35.855 --> 0:1:38.124
Please don't tell Poppy
it was me they followed.

31
0:1:38.158 --> 0:1:39.626
CHARLIE: Don't worry, darling.

32
0:1:39.660 --> 0:1:41.662
What happens in Italy...

33
0:1:41.695 --> 0:1:43.297
(PANTING)

34
0:1:44.164 --> 0:1:45.399
stays in Italy.

35
0:1:46.566 --> 0:1:47.801
Thank you.

36
0:1:49.703 --> 0:1:51.506
(EXPLOSIONS)

37
0:2:0.949 --> 0:2:5.520
Merlin, change of plans.
Wu Ting Feng, Singapore.

38
0:2:5.552 --> 0:2:6.787
Who?
EGGSY: Exactly.

39
0:2:6.820 --> 0:2:8.488
It's the only lead we've got.

40
0:2:8.523 --> 0:2:10.190
So I suggest
you find out who he is.

41
0:2:12.091 --> 0:2:13.127
Come on.

42
0:2:17.131 --> 0:2:19.900
Wu Ting Feng, he's
an assistant at a law firm.

43
0:2:19.932 --> 0:2:21.569
MERLIN: Let's get through
their firewall.

44
0:2:21.601 --> 0:2:22.836
GINGER: Yep.

45
0:2:23.738 --> 0:2:24.972
Merlin...

46
0:2:25.005 --> 0:2:27.475
have you ever wanted
to do more than this?

47
0:2:28.475 --> 0:2:30.077
Are you serious?
Yeah.

48
0:2:30.110 --> 0:2:31.044
This is vital.

49
0:2:31.078 --> 0:2:32.746
Without us, they'd be lost.

50
0:2:32.779 --> 0:2:35.081
I know, but you know
what I mean.

51
0:2:35.115 --> 0:2:37.517
Get out there in the field.

52
0:2:37.551 --> 0:2:38.718
Well, have you ever asked?

53
0:2:38.752 --> 0:2:39.988
Of course I have.

54
0:2:40.020 --> 0:2:42.456
But every time an agent's
position has come up...

55
0:2:42.489 --> 0:2:45.292
Whiskey has voted against me.

56
0:2:45.325 --> 0:2:47.226
No.
Yeah.

57
0:2:47.261 --> 0:2:49.530
Wait, wait, wait.
Look, check it out.

58
0:2:49.564 --> 0:2:50.632
Email in from Poppy,

59
0:2:50.664 --> 0:2:52.533
from a senior partner
at the firm.

60
0:2:53.967 --> 0:2:55.502
They're coordinates.

61
0:2:59.106 --> 0:3:0.341
Cambodia?
