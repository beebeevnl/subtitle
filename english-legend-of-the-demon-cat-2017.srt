1
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,791
Is the melon sweet?

2
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,041
Who's there?

3
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,500
Me.

4
00:02:13,417 --> 00:02:15,542
May I have some?

5
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,000
Looking for me?

6
00:02:50,292 --> 00:02:52,417
Over here.

7
00:02:53,417 --> 00:02:57,917
Come. I'll pay for my meal.

8
00:02:59,917 --> 00:03:04,042
There's money buried under that tree.

9
00:03:07,417 --> 00:03:09,625
Dig it up, it's yours.

10
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,250
I'll be back.

11
00:03:56,042 --> 00:03:57,167
The Master is home.

12
00:04:00,292 --> 00:04:01,292
Yunqiao.

13
00:04:03,667 --> 00:04:04,667
Chunqin.

14
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:06,667
Hurry.

15
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,667
I have to tell you...

16
00:04:19,667 --> 00:04:21,667
There really was buried treasure?

17
00:04:43,292 --> 00:04:45,667
That sound

18
00:04:45,917 --> 00:04:48,792
I've heard it in my dreams.

19
00:05:16,292 --> 00:05:19,667
In the 21st year of the emperor's reign,

20
00:05:20,542 --> 00:05:23,500
the Japanese monk Kukai came to Chang'an

21
00:05:23,792 --> 00:05:25,292
for an exorcism.

22
00:06:01,292 --> 00:06:03,250
How long has he been like this?

23
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:06,417
His eyes haven't shut for a week.

24
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,541
Please begin.

25
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:41,791
Scribe Bai.

26
00:06:41,917 --> 00:06:42,625
Present.

27
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,666
Write: "The emperor died of illness."

28
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:50,167
Write.

29
00:06:54,417 --> 00:06:56,000
Master Kukai.

30
00:06:58,917 --> 00:07:01,417
The emperor's death must be kept secret.

31
00:07:01,667 --> 00:07:05,292
Go, and it'll be as if you were never here.

32
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,666
Oh!

33
00:07:09,042 --> 00:07:10,542
Wipe your shoes.

34
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:19,750
So I'd come to cure the emperor's disease.

35
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:25,166
But that was no ordinary illness.

36
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:30,541
Master Kukai.

37
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:35,666
Scribe Bai.

38
00:07:36,792 --> 00:07:38,500
Why didn't you say anything?

39
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:39,875
The imperial physician said

40
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:41,792
he died of illness.

41
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,166
No illness keeps a man awake for a week.

42
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:51,625
I'm the scribe, I must keep exact records.

43
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:54,791
I can't write anything I'm unsure about.

44
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:57,292
How long have you been a scribe?

45
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,541
Three years. Why?

46
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,041
The emperor's pet cat is black, yes?

47
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:06,416
In three years, I never saw a pet cat.

48
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,125
When I kowtowed I got fur on my hands.

49
00:08:15,542 --> 00:08:19,292
True. Only cat fur is this fine and soft.

50
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,250
What are you looking for?

51
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:30,750
Pawprints?

52
00:08:30,917 --> 00:08:34,375
Not only did a cat enter the palace,

53
00:08:34,917 --> 00:08:37,000
it was near the emperor's bed.

54
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:44,292
A cat was involved with his death?

55
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:46,292
What's this?

56
00:08:53,542 --> 00:08:56,917
The Emperor is dead. Li Song is next.

57
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,041
Who's Li Song?

58
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,250
The prince, the next emperor.

59
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,625
He'll be back tomorrow.

60
00:09:26,792 --> 00:09:28,042
Who?

61
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,125
The cat.

62
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,375
We'll have to buy more fish.

63
00:09:35,292 --> 00:09:39,292
Nothing too big. He only eats the eyes.

64
00:11:32,417 --> 00:11:34,375
This was part of the old palace.

65
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,875
What's that noise?

66
00:11:51,917 --> 00:11:53,292
Careful.

67
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,125
Huh. Just a cat.

68
00:12:04,542 --> 00:12:07,917
It's a time of mourning. Stay alert.

69
00:12:08,167 --> 00:12:09,417
C'mon, let's go.

70
00:12:20,417 --> 00:12:21,667
Master Kukai.

71
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,666
Scribe Bai.

72
00:12:24,417 --> 00:12:27,625
You're right, there's a cat in the palace.

73
00:12:28,042 --> 00:12:29,000
You saw it?

74
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:33,292
No. The night patrol told me.

75
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,541
And another strange thing...

76
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:41,542
Go on.

77
00:12:42,292 --> 00:12:44,000
Chen Yunqiao, an imperial guard,

78
00:12:44,167 --> 00:12:46,917
had a talking cat at his house.

79
00:12:47,292 --> 00:12:49,125
Where'd you hear that?

80
00:12:50,417 --> 00:12:52,042
His servants were gossiping.

81
00:12:53,167 --> 00:12:54,625
Too bad I'm leaving.

82
00:12:56,167 --> 00:12:58,125
It's none of my business now.

83
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,916
And you, will you report it?

84
00:13:02,542 --> 00:13:04,667
It's none of my business, either.

85
00:13:05,792 --> 00:13:08,125
I'm finished. I quit!

86
00:13:09,042 --> 00:13:12,042
I've retired to devote myself to poetry.

87
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:13,792
I'm a poet.

88
00:13:13,917 --> 00:13:16,042
I've heard Chang'an is full of poets.

89
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,018
I'm different.

90
00:13:17,042 --> 00:13:19,542
I could have been a high official.

91
00:13:19,792 --> 00:13:21,000
I chose not to.

92
00:13:22,292 --> 00:13:24,125
But why be a lowly scribe?

93
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,250
That's for my poetry too.

94
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:28,416
Only a scribe stays in the palace,

95
00:13:28,792 --> 00:13:30,875
seeing the emperor's every move.

96
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,666
Like a eunuch, minus the inconvenience.

97
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,416
Your poem is about palace life?

98
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:39,500
Yes. No more questions. I'll say no more.

99
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:40,768
What's the poem called?

100
00:13:40,792 --> 00:13:42,042
Song of Everlasting Sorrow.

101
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,166
So it's a love poem.

102
00:13:47,042 --> 00:13:49,000
I told you, I'm not talking.

103
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:52,666
Who's it about?

104
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:55,667
The emperor, right?

105
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:57,291
So you needed to understand him.

106
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:58,291
Enough!

107
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,625
His love had to be a concubine.

108
00:14:01,667 --> 00:14:02,999
Explain, why you say "had to be"?

109
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,208
Explain, why you say "had to be"?

110
00:14:05,542 --> 00:14:08,625
He didn't pick his empress.
Forget servants.

111
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,041
Who else is there?

112
00:14:12,792 --> 00:14:13,917
Clever!

113
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,125
You're too kind.

114
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,393
You're right.

115
00:14:18,417 --> 00:14:21,083
It's about the emperor's love for a lady.

116
00:14:21,542 --> 00:14:22,500
Is it finished?

117
00:14:22,667 --> 00:14:23,643
Not yet!

118
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:26,292
When it is, history will remember me.

119
00:14:26,542 --> 00:14:28,125
But don't tell anyone yet!

120
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,166
Was Li Bo the greatest Tang poet?

121
00:14:31,917 --> 00:14:33,726
Li Bo lived a long time ago.

122
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,916
He was lucky... it was a golden age.

123
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,417
Have you heard of Bai Juyi?

124
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:39,292
He is the greatest poet of today!

125
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:42,417
Oh? When will you introduce me?

126
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:46,125
Bai Juyi is very full of himself.

127
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,226
He makes his own rules,

128
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,916
lives for poetry, and sees no one!

129
00:14:58,917 --> 00:15:01,250
Kukai, what's up with you?

130
00:15:01,917 --> 00:15:03,542
Why rush back to Japan?

131
00:15:04,417 --> 00:15:06,542
Why did you really come here?

132
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:10,041
To study with Abbot
Huiguo at Qinglong Temple

133
00:15:10,292 --> 00:15:12,417
but I couldn't get a foot in the door.

134
00:15:12,792 --> 00:15:15,042
Kukai, it's not just you.

135
00:15:15,542 --> 00:15:18,375
Qinglong is the home of Tantric Buddhism.

136
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,041
Huiguo obtained the Tantric secrets abroad.

137
00:15:20,042 --> 00:15:22,125
Huiguo obtained the Tantric secrets abroad.

138
00:15:22,292 --> 00:15:23,500
Of more than a thousand monks,

139
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,916
he says none are fit to be his disciples!

140
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:41,375
Have some melon!

141
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,375
One melon can't feed everyone.

142
00:15:46,042 --> 00:15:47,917
I'll make some more.

143
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:50,375
Great!

144
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,417
Water.

145
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:14,000
It's sprouting! It's sprouting!

146
00:16:16,792 --> 00:16:18,750
Sprouting!

147
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,791
See that?

148
00:16:25,292 --> 00:16:26,417
Grow!

149
00:16:28,417 --> 00:16:29,667
Bigger!

150
00:16:31,542 --> 00:16:32,875
Bloom!

151
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:35,916
Bravo!

152
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,875
See that? Melons!

153
00:16:43,417 --> 00:16:44,125
It's an illusion.

154
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,000
They're melons! We all can see them.

155
00:16:48,292 --> 00:16:49,375
We've all been taken in.

156
00:16:50,292 --> 00:16:52,917
Bravo!

157
00:16:57,917 --> 00:16:58,667
Let's go.

158
00:17:03,042 --> 00:17:05,292
Gentlemen, some melon?

159
00:17:07,167 --> 00:17:08,417
I don't have money on me.

160
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:12,416
I sell illusions, not melons.

161
00:17:12,792 --> 00:17:14,625
You saw through it, so no charge.

162
00:17:15,417 --> 00:17:16,292
I'm sorry.

163
00:17:17,292 --> 00:17:18,042
Old man...

164
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:21,000
only one melon was real, right?

165
00:17:21,417 --> 00:17:22,542
Shh...

166
00:17:25,667 --> 00:17:27,250
Impressive.

167
00:17:28,542 --> 00:17:30,917
Is that a Japanese accent?

168
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,291
My name is Kukai.

169
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,916
It's an honor. This melon is a gift.

170
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,166
Too kind.

171
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:48,791
What's dripping?

172
00:17:51,917 --> 00:17:52,917
He got me after all!

173
00:17:53,917 --> 00:17:55,167
Toss it, quickly!

174
00:18:00,292 --> 00:18:01,917
Now it's turned back into a melon.

175
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:05,042
What a powerful illusion.

176
00:18:06,042 --> 00:18:09,292
Now I might believe in a talking cat.

177
00:18:09,417 --> 00:18:11,875
What was that guard's name?

178
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:13,625
Chen Yunqiao.

179
00:18:14,167 --> 00:18:16,292
Hey, Yunqiao, slow down.

180
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:19,041
The girls don't wait for anyone.

181
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:28,291
Giddyap!

182
00:18:33,542 --> 00:18:34,792
Chen Yunqiao is the one in the middle.

183
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,166
Here!

184
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,476
Girls, where are you going?

185
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,291
Come with us!

186
00:18:54,792 --> 00:18:57,542
Don't take my girl tonight!

187
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,750
You're all here.

188
00:19:02,042 --> 00:19:03,893
We want our bonus!

189
00:19:03,917 --> 00:19:04,875
Here!

190
00:19:06,292 --> 00:19:07,667
Where are they going?

191
00:19:08,917 --> 00:19:09,875
Huyu House.

192
00:19:10,292 --> 00:19:11,667
The city's top brothel!

193
00:19:12,042 --> 00:19:12,917
Are you still game?

194
00:19:13,792 --> 00:19:15,417
Of course I am!

195
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,393
Hurry up, girls.

196
00:19:29,417 --> 00:19:30,917
Coming!

197
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:34,916
Yunqiao! Yunqiao!

198
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,292
Yunqiao! Yunqiao!

199
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,268
Pardon me!

200
00:19:55,292 --> 00:19:56,875
I'm Yulian.

201
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,101
Why haven't we met before?

202
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,666
Yulian is new here.

203
00:20:04,042 --> 00:20:05,167
Sir.

204
00:20:06,167 --> 00:20:08,125
This flower is crooked.

205
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:09,542
Let's go.

206
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:11,250
C'mon. You'll be mine tonight.

207
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:13,375
Sister Lixiang...

208
00:20:27,417 --> 00:20:29,875
How weird.

209
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,208
This is the Tang of romance!

210
00:21:10,542 --> 00:21:13,184
Aren't brothels forbidden to monks?

211
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:14,476
You're entering a brothel.

212
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,750
I'm here for the beautiful music.

213
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:04,749
Scribe Bai!

214
00:22:05,917 --> 00:22:08,625
I got your gown back from the pawn shop.

215
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:10,476
Excellent. Pawn it again!

216
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,583
Sure!

217
00:22:12,042 --> 00:22:13,583
I see you're a regular.

218
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,499
But first time here with a monk!

219
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:02,291
It's you who looks like a regular!

220
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:31,684
For you!

221
00:23:31,708 --> 00:23:36,208
Reward them! Tips for all!

222
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:41,666
Beautiful dancing, Yulian.

223
00:23:42,292 --> 00:23:43,500
Drink up.

224
00:24:11,167 --> 00:24:12,292
Chen Yunqiao.

225
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,791
Who's that?

226
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:22,999
Me.

227
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:27,208
Spent all the money? Want more?

228
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:29,208
Want more?

229
00:24:29,708 --> 00:24:30,499
That's the cat!

230
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:37,208
Yunqiao, your cat's here with your purse!

231
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:49,083
I've thrown a feast and paid you all

232
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:53,083
but what to offer a mere animal?

233
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,458
Have a fish.

234
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:01,541
I only eat eyeballs.

235
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,166
You know that.

236
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:08,333
Whose eyes will you give me?

237
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:42,125
Over there!

238
00:25:52,167 --> 00:25:53,375
UP there!

239
00:26:11,125 --> 00:26:12,583
Beast!

240
00:26:19,792 --> 00:26:21,167
Yunqiao.

241
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:24,874
Debts must be repaid.

242
00:26:26,417 --> 00:26:27,750
Listen up.

243
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,750
I'll see you at home tomorrow night.

244
00:26:56,208 --> 00:26:57,583
MY eyes!

245
00:26:59,042 --> 00:27:00,417
MY eyes!

246
00:27:15,625 --> 00:27:16,583
Chunqin!

247
00:27:44,458 --> 00:27:46,018
What sort of monster did this?

248
00:27:46,042 --> 00:27:47,417
A cat.

249
00:27:50,458 --> 00:27:54,958
What's the link to the cat in the palace?

250
00:27:55,875 --> 00:27:57,750
They're one and the same.

251
00:27:58,542 --> 00:27:59,542
Oh?

252
00:27:59,833 --> 00:28:02,708
Three heavy pawprints, one light.

253
00:28:03,333 --> 00:28:04,416
Exactly the same.

254
00:28:04,958 --> 00:28:07,791
But what's that mean?

255
00:28:08,208 --> 00:28:11,249
One of its legs was injured.

256
00:28:11,917 --> 00:28:13,667
Look here, Inspector Li.

257
00:28:17,417 --> 00:28:19,000
You said the emperor

258
00:28:19,458 --> 00:28:22,208
was 'frightened to death'. By this cat?

259
00:28:22,917 --> 00:28:24,125
I'm sure of it.

260
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:33,916
Then we wronged you,

261
00:28:34,917 --> 00:28:35,875
Scribe Bai.

262
00:28:36,625 --> 00:28:38,041
You didn't resign.

263
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,018
Fired, resigned, same thing.

264
00:28:40,042 --> 00:28:41,643
A lowly official still has principles.

265
00:28:41,667 --> 00:28:43,625
All I ask is not to record lies.

266
00:28:50,625 --> 00:28:52,666
Yesterday, they crowned the prince.

267
00:28:53,125 --> 00:28:56,708
Straight away, he became paralyzed.

268
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:01,375
The emperor is dead. Li Song is next.

269
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:03,166
The prophecy has come to pass.

270
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:07,541
No emperor has had a curse before.

271
00:29:08,417 --> 00:29:09,458
Who can lift it?

272
00:29:09,792 --> 00:29:11,375
Kukai is from Japan.

273
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:14,250
He's a famous exorcist.

274
00:29:14,458 --> 00:29:17,958
Who better to take on the demon cat?

275
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:21,541
Why do this to me?

276
00:29:22,042 --> 00:29:23,875
You're an exorcist.

277
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:26,791
You want to get into Qinglong Temple.

278
00:29:26,917 --> 00:29:29,417
Now you've good reason to stay!

279
00:29:29,625 --> 00:29:30,666
Right.

280
00:29:34,167 --> 00:29:35,583
What are you thinking?

281
00:29:36,667 --> 00:29:37,957
Why did the cat attack Chen Yunqiao?

282
00:29:37,958 --> 00:29:41,166
Why did the cat attack Chen Yunqiao?

283
00:29:42,583 --> 00:29:44,583
He's head of the Imperial Guards.

284
00:29:44,917 --> 00:29:46,726
What's their role?

285
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,333
To protect the emperor.

286
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,916
His family has done this

287
00:29:51,917 --> 00:29:53,333
for three generations.

288
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,041
Three generations?

289
00:29:56,917 --> 00:30:01,417
The cat said, "Debts will be repaid."

290
00:30:04,458 --> 00:30:05,999
But who incurred this debt?

291
00:30:06,375 --> 00:30:07,833
What kind Of debt

292
00:30:08,458 --> 00:30:10,458
sees two emperors fall

293
00:30:10,792 --> 00:30:12,917
and their top guard attacked?

294
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,000
The palace?

295
00:30:19,708 --> 00:30:21,541
Why are we here?

296
00:30:22,417 --> 00:30:24,250
You asked whose debt it is.

297
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:26,249
Whose is it?

298
00:30:28,667 --> 00:30:30,309
A previous emperor for sure.

299
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:31,583
One from the past?

300
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:46,000
What's the connection to Chen Yunqiao?

301
00:31:00,417 --> 00:31:03,375
Is the cat really coming back?

302
00:31:05,042 --> 00:31:07,708
He told me so last night.

303
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:15,791
You brought on this disaster.

304
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:19,434
You spent the money.

305
00:31:19,458 --> 00:31:20,249
Shh...

306
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,208
Chunqin!

307
00:33:03,667 --> 00:33:05,167
She's your wife.

308
00:33:06,292 --> 00:33:08,917
Will you save her?

309
00:33:15,583 --> 00:33:17,124
Help! Help!

310
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:21,666
Open the door!

311
00:33:23,667 --> 00:33:27,750
Yunqiao, save me!

312
00:33:28,708 --> 00:33:29,559
Save me!

313
00:33:29,583 --> 00:33:30,291
Chunqin!

314
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:32,417
Save me, Yunqiao!

315
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:57,499
How'd you get here?

316
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,625
You weren't going to save me.

317
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,041
Who are you?

318
00:34:13,583 --> 00:34:15,624
Yulian is sick?

319
00:34:17,875 --> 00:34:20,500
She fell into a coma.

320
00:34:21,917 --> 00:34:23,875
No, she was poisoned.

321
00:34:24,375 --> 00:34:25,059
Huh?

322
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:27,291
Get some raw meat, hurry!

323
00:34:27,958 --> 00:34:29,041
Okay.

324
00:34:36,417 --> 00:34:38,207
Such beauty,

325
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,958
rotting like a dead flower!

326
00:34:40,125 --> 00:34:43,041
No time for poems. Find a brush and ink.

327
00:34:49,833 --> 00:34:52,309
Let me stay for the night.

328
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:53,166
Hmph.

329
00:35:04,583 --> 00:35:06,374
What's with all the Buddhist symbols?

330
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,291
It's not just a symbol. It's light.

331
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,500
Look.

332
00:35:16,708 --> 00:35:17,666
Here.

333
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,125
Is it fresh?

334
00:35:20,333 --> 00:35:20,851
Yes.

335
00:35:20,875 --> 00:35:22,083
Give it to Bai.

336
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:23,500
Needle.

337
00:35:25,583 --> 00:35:27,499
Hold onto her!

338
00:35:34,125 --> 00:35:34,833
Catch them.

339
00:35:40,625 --> 00:35:41,916
What are these?

340
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,083
Venom worms!

341
00:35:47,667 --> 00:35:49,833
They poison living flesh.

342
00:35:50,417 --> 00:35:53,083
Only raw meat can draw them out.

343
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,000
Who did this to her?

344
00:35:59,292 --> 00:36:01,000
Someone with a grudge.

345
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:02,833
For sure it's Lixiang.

346
00:36:03,167 --> 00:36:05,000
Yunqiao was her lover.

347
00:36:05,167 --> 00:36:06,917
She hated her for stealing him!

348
00:36:07,292 --> 00:36:08,750
Not necessarily.

349
00:36:09,583 --> 00:36:11,583
The wine was meant for Yunqiao.

350
00:36:12,375 --> 00:36:14,208
He unwittingly gave it to Yulian.

351
00:36:17,125 --> 00:36:18,708
Master!

352
00:36:22,042 --> 00:36:25,750
Please... save my wife too!

353
00:36:38,167 --> 00:36:39,208
Huh?

354
00:36:41,208 --> 00:36:45,708
Her robes, clouds; Her face, flowers.

355
00:36:45,917 --> 00:36:47,417
Careful!

356
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:51,374
Where are you going?

357
00:36:57,458 --> 00:36:58,226
Chunqin?!

358
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:58,875
Shh...

359
00:37:00,875 --> 00:37:01,958
So who was that?

360
00:37:02,708 --> 00:37:03,874
An illusion.

361
00:37:05,042 --> 00:37:06,083
How do you know?

362
00:37:07,167 --> 00:37:09,000
She cast no shadow.

363
00:37:10,417 --> 00:37:13,458
Only cats walk on rooftops.

364
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:17,375
What poem was she reciting?

365
00:37:18,917 --> 00:37:20,417
It's by Li Bo.

366
00:37:20,667 --> 00:37:23,833
It likens beauty to clouds and flowers.

367
00:37:24,083 --> 00:37:26,958
When was it written and where?

368
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:30,958
Let me take you somewhere.

369
00:37:53,125 --> 00:37:54,416
What is this place?

370
00:37:54,625 --> 00:37:55,875
The imperial library.

371
00:37:56,458 --> 00:37:57,749
I think of it as my own.

372
00:37:58,083 --> 00:37:58,791
Over there.

373
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,041
You lost your job but still come here?

374
00:38:02,333 --> 00:38:03,374
Whatever.

375
00:38:05,667 --> 00:38:06,917
Push, Kukai!

376
00:38:10,083 --> 00:38:11,291
Stop.

377
00:38:16,667 --> 00:38:18,042
What...

378
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:21,476
A little bit more.

379
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,291
Okay.

380
00:38:23,625 --> 00:38:24,458
Stop.

381
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:31,250
It was the spring of 755.

382
00:38:31,667 --> 00:38:33,332
Emperor Li

383
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:36,333
was celebrating his beloved's birthday.

384
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,083
Who was his beloved?

385
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:42,499
The exotic beauty Lady Yang.

386
00:38:43,708 --> 00:38:45,166
The Tang emperor

387
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:50,833
had 3000 women, but eyes only for one.

388
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:55,999
Emperor Li adored her.

389
00:38:59,583 --> 00:39:02,291
He filled a giant pool with wine

390
00:39:02,417 --> 00:39:05,708
and the hall With 100,000 flowers.

391
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:09,541
Guests came from all over.

392
00:39:10,292 --> 00:39:14,208
He called it the Feast of Supreme Joy!

393
00:39:15,292 --> 00:39:18,226
Emperor Li ordered Li Bo

394
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:20,250
to write a poem for Lady Yang.

395
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:24,250
Her robes, clouds; Her face, flowers.

396
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,875
Li Bo guarded his talent,

397
00:39:27,458 --> 00:39:29,624
writing happily about common folk,

398
00:39:29,958 --> 00:39:32,458
but shunning the rich and privileged.

399
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,708
This poem was the only exception.

400
00:39:35,792 --> 00:39:37,893
He wrote it at the Feast of Supreme Joy.

401
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:39,625
His first sight of Lady Yang

402
00:39:40,125 --> 00:39:42,708
drove him to madness.

403
00:39:42,958 --> 00:39:43,768
Madness?

404
00:39:43,792 --> 00:39:45,250
Only madness

405
00:39:45,542 --> 00:39:48,167
could inspire such a great poem.

406
00:39:49,292 --> 00:39:52,292
Li Bo wrote at the emperor's behest.

407
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:55,083
The first line...

408
00:39:56,125 --> 00:40:00,166
Her robes, clouds; Her face, flowers.

409
00:40:01,667 --> 00:40:03,375
Having seen her face,

410
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:05,934
why write only of clouds and flowers?

411
00:40:05,958 --> 00:40:07,499
Good monk...

412
00:40:07,958 --> 00:40:10,416
hers was a beauty beyond words.

413
00:40:10,667 --> 00:40:11,726
It's poetry

414
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:12,666
as romantic as her beauty and his love.

415
00:40:12,667 --> 00:40:15,125
As romantic as her beauty and his love.

416
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:18,041
Come!

417
00:40:22,083 --> 00:40:23,208
All great emperors

418
00:40:23,708 --> 00:40:25,874
want to grow the realm and inspire awe.

419
00:40:26,167 --> 00:40:27,542
Emperor Li was no different.

420
00:40:27,667 --> 00:40:30,667
But that wasn't the real him.

421
00:40:30,792 --> 00:40:32,207
Daring to give up imperial glory for love.

422
00:40:32,208 --> 00:40:34,374
Daring to give up imperial glory for love.

423
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,166
That was Emperor Li.

424
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:42,166
He loved Lady Yang.

425
00:40:42,667 --> 00:40:45,667
He saw her as the soul of the dynasty.

426
00:40:49,917 --> 00:40:52,125
Often in my dreams at night,

427
00:40:52,625 --> 00:40:55,583
I live in those glorious times.

428
00:40:56,292 --> 00:40:58,667
I too am at the feast

429
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:02,417
and lay my eyes on her.

430
00:41:22,875 --> 00:41:24,000
May I ask

431
00:41:24,583 --> 00:41:26,458
how many poems did Li Bo write?

432
00:41:29,458 --> 00:41:31,458
He was a legend.

433
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,250
Too many to count.

434
00:41:38,417 --> 00:41:41,833
So Why'd the demon cat pick this one?

435
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:44,250
Who was he reciting for?

436
00:41:44,917 --> 00:41:45,958
What do you mean?

437
00:41:46,208 --> 00:41:47,291
It was for you.

438
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,791
If you, like Li Bo,

439
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:52,333
are writing about Lady Yang...

440
00:41:53,583 --> 00:41:55,268
Your "Song of Everlasting Sorrow"

441
00:41:55,292 --> 00:41:58,333
is about the emperor's love for Lady Yang.

442
00:41:58,625 --> 00:42:00,000
Am I right?

443
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:02,458
Quality guaranteed!

444
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:06,041
How much for one?

445
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:10,458
Didn't I give you one before?

446
00:42:10,833 --> 00:42:13,208
Yes. It was delicious.

447
00:42:16,875 --> 00:42:19,333
Say what you came to say.

448
00:42:19,667 --> 00:42:22,333
Your magic. There's one thing I don't get.

449
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:25,333
It's magic, what's there to get?

450
00:42:25,542 --> 00:42:26,958
It's just tricks, right?

451
00:42:27,125 --> 00:42:30,250
But a killer cat is no mere trick.

452
00:42:30,583 --> 00:42:32,458
So I'd like your advice.

453
00:42:34,958 --> 00:42:39,166
What do cats have to do with melons?

454
00:42:39,375 --> 00:42:41,000
If a melon isn't a melon,

455
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:42,416
then a cat...?

456
00:42:44,375 --> 00:42:46,833
Isn't a cat!

457
00:42:47,833 --> 00:42:49,958
What is it, then?

458
00:42:53,542 --> 00:42:56,667
You think melons come from thin air?

459
00:42:57,875 --> 00:43:00,833
Inside the illusion is reality.

460
00:43:01,792 --> 00:43:06,292
So I must look to the cat itself.

461
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:07,833
Thank you!

462
00:43:21,625 --> 00:43:23,333
Yunqiao's house?

463
00:43:25,083 --> 00:43:26,416
Will I end up dead and eyeless too?

464
00:43:26,417 --> 00:43:28,083
Will I end up dead and eyeless too?

465
00:43:28,875 --> 00:43:30,125
Not yet.

466
00:43:32,583 --> 00:43:33,958
What's that supposed to mean?

467
00:43:34,333 --> 00:43:37,666
It probably knows about your poem.

468
00:43:44,917 --> 00:43:46,583
That tree wasn't here yesterday!

469
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:52,125
Who's that woman?

470
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:53,666
Isn't it Chunqin?

471
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
No.

472
00:44:10,333 --> 00:44:11,791
Beware the magic!

473
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:32,792
It wasn't like this last night.

474
00:44:33,417 --> 00:44:34,667
Hey!

475
00:44:39,667 --> 00:44:43,333
Gentlemen, come on up.

476
00:44:49,042 --> 00:44:52,292
Have a seat. There's tea.

477
00:45:07,792 --> 00:45:12,292
Kukai, I hear tea is popular in Japan too.

478
00:45:12,458 --> 00:45:13,226
Yes.

479
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:14,833
You know his name?

480
00:45:15,333 --> 00:45:18,374
I know you, too, Bai Juyi...

481
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:22,541
the famous poet of Chang'an!

482
00:45:22,833 --> 00:45:23,541
Indeed.

483
00:45:23,958 --> 00:45:26,541
The one who makes his own rules.

484
00:45:26,542 --> 00:45:28,917
The one who makes his own rules.

485
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:47,750
Juyi, have you finished your poem?

486
00:45:48,625 --> 00:45:52,291
I told you she knew you were writing it.

487
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:55,708
In fact, you finished it long ago,

488
00:45:56,583 --> 00:45:58,749
but you're not happy with it,

489
00:45:59,708 --> 00:46:01,374
and it's no wonder

490
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:04,541
because it's not the real story.

491
00:46:05,833 --> 00:46:09,541
And Lady Yang didn't inspire Li Bo's poem.

492
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,458
He met her only after he wrote it.

493
00:46:14,792 --> 00:46:17,167
You're saying he faked it?

494
00:46:19,417 --> 00:46:21,750
If it wasn't sincere...

495
00:46:22,167 --> 00:46:24,250
why recite it from the roof?

496
00:46:24,792 --> 00:46:26,434
Her robes, clouds; Her face, flowers.

497
00:46:26,458 --> 00:46:28,499
Lady Yang loved that poem.

498
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:31,559
She told Li Bo that herself.

499
00:46:31,583 --> 00:46:33,708
But didn't you say they hadn't met?

500
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:35,875
Oh they met.

501
00:46:36,333 --> 00:46:38,249
But only after he wrote the poem

502
00:46:38,375 --> 00:46:41,375
and threw his brush into the pool of wine.

503
00:46:41,583 --> 00:46:44,374
How do you know all that?

504
00:46:44,625 --> 00:46:45,666
I was there.

505
00:46:45,792 --> 00:46:46,625
Where?

506
00:46:46,958 --> 00:46:48,124
At the banquet.

507
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:51,583
Which banquet?

508
00:46:54,542 --> 00:46:56,958
The "Feast of Supreme Joy".

509
00:46:58,167 --> 00:46:59,417
Who are you?

510
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:05,875
But first tell us about the injury.

511
00:47:06,542 --> 00:47:08,292
It's your back paw, right?

512
00:47:10,625 --> 00:47:11,625
Yes.

513
00:47:12,417 --> 00:47:14,792
I was Emperor Li's pet cat.

514
00:47:21,208 --> 00:47:24,208
We should've grown old together.

515
00:47:26,125 --> 00:47:27,875
But when the rebellion came,

516
00:47:29,542 --> 00:47:32,375
he abandoned me

517
00:47:35,125 --> 00:47:36,500
and fled for his life.

518
00:47:37,292 --> 00:47:38,375
And then?

519
00:47:38,667 --> 00:47:39,958
After that,

520
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:43,708
a cruel man buried me alive.

521
00:47:43,917 --> 00:47:47,333
But it wasn't my fate to die. I escaped.

522
00:47:47,667 --> 00:47:50,958
That's why you put a curse on him.

523
00:47:51,333 --> 00:47:54,208
He ordered them to bury me.

524
00:47:55,083 --> 00:47:58,749
I'm not done with them yet!

525
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:01,125
What do you have against Yunqiao?

526
00:48:01,625 --> 00:48:04,541
It was his father who buried me alive.

527
00:48:05,583 --> 00:48:08,208
That all happened thirty years ago.

528
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:11,041
A cat doesn't live that long.

529
00:48:11,458 --> 00:48:12,893
While here to take revenge

530
00:48:12,917 --> 00:48:15,583
I ate a poisonous fish

531
00:48:15,708 --> 00:48:17,874
and died under the bed.

532
00:48:18,333 --> 00:48:21,249
My soul was trapped in my body

533
00:48:21,375 --> 00:48:23,875
and I turned into a demon.

534
00:48:24,292 --> 00:48:27,000
Why use Chunqin to recite the poem?

535
00:48:28,417 --> 00:48:31,292
Why show us Lady Yang by the tree?

536
00:48:32,875 --> 00:48:35,333
Is there a secret you want to tell us?

537
00:48:44,167 --> 00:48:48,167
Did I not share her fate?

538
00:48:51,417 --> 00:48:52,708
Who?

539
00:49:14,042 --> 00:49:15,333
Cat skin?

540
00:49:36,667 --> 00:49:39,958
Master Kukai, thank you.

541
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:41,833
Scribe Bai.

542
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,958
How dare they play banned music.

543
00:50:12,583 --> 00:50:15,416
Lady Yang loved to dance.

544
00:50:15,542 --> 00:50:18,582
Emperor Li wrote the song for her himself.

545
00:50:18,583 --> 00:50:20,059
Emperor Li wrote the song for her himself.

546
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:22,124
It was banned after the rebellion.

547
00:50:34,417 --> 00:50:35,417
Yunqiao!

548
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:05,500
You brought on this disaster!

549
00:51:06,875 --> 00:51:08,500
It's your fault!

550
00:51:08,708 --> 00:51:09,958
Stop it!

551
00:51:11,375 --> 00:51:12,643
I want you dead!

552
00:51:12,667 --> 00:51:14,417
Kukai! Save Chunqin!

553
00:51:16,167 --> 00:51:17,375
Kukai!

554
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:48,666
Chunqin!

555
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:51,625
Chunqin!

556
00:51:57,542 --> 00:51:59,875
Don't bury me.

557
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:01,833
It's cold down there...

558
00:52:02,333 --> 00:52:03,791
What?

559
00:52:10,875 --> 00:52:12,958
It wasn't me who killed her!

560
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,333
Yunqiao?

561
00:52:24,292 --> 00:52:25,417
Reward! Reward!

562
00:52:28,667 --> 00:52:30,042
Reward!

563
00:52:34,458 --> 00:52:36,666
Don't tell me that was all an illusion.

564
00:52:39,667 --> 00:52:41,208
Yunqiao went mad.

565
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,291
Chunqin is dead.

566
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:52,291
Did you hear her last words?

567
00:52:52,792 --> 00:52:56,417
Don't bury me, it's cold down there.

568
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:58,875
The cat said he shared her fate

569
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:03,125
was he talking about Lady Yang?

570
00:53:04,792 --> 00:53:07,917
They tried to bury the cat alive.

571
00:53:10,792 --> 00:53:14,167
He was trying to tell us

572
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:17,541
that Lady Yang was buried alive too.

573
00:53:20,167 --> 00:53:22,792
Do you realise what you're saying?

574
00:53:29,042 --> 00:53:32,167
You say don't let the magic fool you

575
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:35,167
but you trust everything that cat says.

576
00:53:40,792 --> 00:53:45,292
This time you fell for it, not me!

577
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:10,250
Who said you could come in?

578
00:54:10,875 --> 00:54:12,250
The door was open.

579
00:54:14,625 --> 00:54:18,666
I told you... Juyi doesn't receive guests!

580
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:31,166
What good is that?

581
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,375
The cat saw these drawings

582
00:54:33,917 --> 00:54:37,500
and made Chunqin your vision of Lady Yang.

583
00:54:38,375 --> 00:54:42,250
From palace to brothel to Yunqiao's house.

584
00:54:43,125 --> 00:54:47,000
He has been guiding you towards the truth.

585
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:50,291
But why me?

586
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:52,416
Because of your poem.

587
00:54:53,625 --> 00:54:54,625
I also understand

588
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:57,416
that if Lady Yang was buried alive

589
00:54:58,042 --> 00:55:00,000
then your years of toil were wasted.

590
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,250
Understand?

591
00:55:06,875 --> 00:55:09,750
You just get here and you understand?

592
00:55:10,542 --> 00:55:12,416
Cold nights agonizing over a single word.

593
00:55:12,417 --> 00:55:14,250
Cold nights agonizing over a single word.

594
00:55:14,375 --> 00:55:16,250
What do you know of "toil"?

595
00:55:19,042 --> 00:55:20,500
Because you are Juyi.

596
00:55:21,292 --> 00:55:22,792
Because thirty years have passed,

597
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:26,166
and only you keep Lady Yang in your heart.

598
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:42,791
Her death is recorded in history!

599
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:45,125
The rebellion, Emperor Li's escape,

600
00:55:45,292 --> 00:55:47,250
and the mutiny of his troops,

601
00:55:47,417 --> 00:55:48,375
forced him to order.

602
00:55:48,625 --> 00:55:50,500
Eunuch Gao to strangle her.

603
00:55:50,875 --> 00:55:52,207
You know

604
00:55:52,208 --> 00:55:54,541
a scribe can falsify records.

605
00:55:54,542 --> 00:55:55,582
That's why

606
00:55:55,583 --> 00:55:57,958
I risked my life to steal the evidence.

607
00:55:58,125 --> 00:55:58,625
Oh?

608
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:04,166
From the palace? Let's see it!

609
00:56:07,042 --> 00:56:09,750
'Jade Girl' was her baby name.

610
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,500
A lock of hair. It was a token of her love.

611
00:56:15,417 --> 00:56:18,667
Emperor Li died years ago,
leaving behind countless treasures.

612
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,041
But his most secret treasure chest

613
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:23,125
held only this silk pouch.

614
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:25,250
If he didn't adore her,

615
00:56:25,625 --> 00:56:28,666
why keep a lock of her hair there?

616
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:31,791
You're in love with her too.

617
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:34,416
You're as obsessed as him.

618
00:56:36,792 --> 00:56:38,375
I want justice for her.

619
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,875
The dynasty's decline wasn't her fault.

620
00:56:43,375 --> 00:56:47,250
She shouldn't be buried alone.

621
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:50,916
So I'll do what Emperor Li could not.

622
00:56:51,625 --> 00:56:53,250
I'll bring her back to life!

623
00:56:53,875 --> 00:56:55,750
But as you wrote,

624
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:58,875
you had doubts.

625
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:06,250
Aware of this,

626
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:09,416
the demon cat is trying to tell you

627
00:57:10,292 --> 00:57:13,875
you didn't get the story right.

628
00:57:27,875 --> 00:57:31,666
Sure, I'll never write as well as Li Bo.

629
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:35,875
I'm happy to live in his shadow.

630
00:57:37,042 --> 00:57:39,625
Just don't say my poem is a lie.

631
00:57:40,875 --> 00:57:42,416
Speaking of lies,

632
00:57:43,375 --> 00:57:45,791
I'm a fake myself.

633
00:57:47,875 --> 00:57:49,375
You're not a monk?

634
00:57:51,792 --> 00:57:54,167
I'm an ordinary shaman.

635
00:57:56,167 --> 00:57:59,042
Japan's top exorcist is my master.

636
00:58:00,125 --> 00:58:01,750
But he is unwell,

637
00:58:02,875 --> 00:58:05,000
so sent me in his stead.

638
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:09,375
I'm here for the Tantric teachings.

639
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:11,875
Kukai.

640
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:16,750
In all my years, I've yet
to find enlightenment.

641
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:26,375
I suffer in mind and body.

642
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:31,750
China has obtained the Tantric teachings

643
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:38,000
for release from the
cycle of life and death.

644
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,125
Kukai

645
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:49,000
please,

646
00:58:49,542 --> 00:58:54,042
you must bring back these teachings.

647
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,125
And so I resolved to come here.

648
00:59:02,167 --> 00:59:04,625
Those were his last words.

649
00:59:06,542 --> 00:59:08,000
Master.

650
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:11,666
Goodbye.

651
00:59:32,125 --> 00:59:36,625
The journey tested my pride and confidence.

652
00:59:52,125 --> 00:59:54,000
Aren't you afraid?

653
00:59:55,167 --> 00:59:59,667
With my baby asleep, I'm at peace.

654
01:00:22,750 --> 01:00:26,166
The waves pushed me under. I was terrified.

655
01:00:27,375 --> 01:00:29,416
I struggled to stay alive.

656
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:32,268
In the face of death,

657
01:00:32,292 --> 01:00:35,667
I forgot every prayer.

658
01:00:38,875 --> 01:00:43,125
But I'll never forget her words.

659
01:00:45,125 --> 01:00:48,000
Why couldn't I stay as calm as her?

660
01:00:50,125 --> 01:00:52,000
Since I survived,

661
01:00:52,625 --> 01:00:54,582
I must seek answers in those teachings.

662
01:00:54,583 --> 01:00:56,041
I must seek answers in those teachings.

663
01:01:00,625 --> 01:01:03,791
I found a witness to Lady Yang's death.

664
01:01:07,750 --> 01:01:10,226
Back then, in the palace,

665
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:14,000
I was Lady Yang's morning maid.

666
01:01:14,542 --> 01:01:18,500
Ask me anything you like.

667
01:01:19,417 --> 01:01:22,875
Were you there when she died?

668
01:01:23,375 --> 01:01:24,750
Yes.

669
01:01:24,875 --> 01:01:27,250
The emperor gave the order.

670
01:01:27,792 --> 01:01:31,875
I wove the silk execution cloth

671
01:01:32,542 --> 01:01:34,500
and gave it to Eunuch Gao.

672
01:01:35,167 --> 01:01:36,625
See?

673
01:01:39,542 --> 01:01:40,625
And then?

674
01:01:40,875 --> 01:01:42,791
When they called us in,

675
01:01:43,375 --> 01:01:45,500
Lady Yang was already dead.

676
01:01:45,625 --> 01:01:50,125
So you didn't see Gao strangle her.

677
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:54,000
I couldn't bear it.

678
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:55,625
I'm sorry.

679
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:57,791
Even the emperor turned away.

680
01:01:59,417 --> 01:02:03,917
So how did you know she was dead?

681
01:02:04,625 --> 01:02:09,125
Captain Chen of the guards checked.

682
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:15,750
He held incense under her nose.

683
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,750
The smoke didn't waver,

684
01:02:19,667 --> 01:02:24,167
proof that she'd stopped breathing.

685
01:02:25,125 --> 01:02:28,125
How did she look after death?

686
01:02:30,667 --> 01:02:33,375
Like she was sleeping,

687
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:37,250
even lovelier than when she was alive.

688
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:02,750
So you wove the execution cloth.

689
01:03:14,417 --> 01:03:16,417
She looked like she was asleep?

690
01:03:16,625 --> 01:03:18,000
That's strange.

691
01:03:18,250 --> 01:03:19,791
If she'd been strangled,

692
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,500
she'd be in terrible pain.

693
01:03:23,125 --> 01:03:24,375
I don't get it either.

694
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:25,916
Who was Captain Chen?

695
01:03:26,167 --> 01:03:27,250
I told you before.

696
01:03:27,375 --> 01:03:29,018
Yunqiao is a third generation guard.

697
01:03:29,042 --> 01:03:30,500
Captain Chen was Yunqiao's dad,

698
01:03:30,625 --> 01:03:32,375
the instigator of the mutiny.

699
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:35,000
It's clear now.

700
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:38,893
The cat attacks anyone
involved in her death.

701
01:03:38,917 --> 01:03:41,476
So then why spare the old woman?

702
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:42,375
What!

703
01:03:45,625 --> 01:03:46,500
Hurry!

704
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:59,000
I shouldn't have brought you here.

705
01:04:04,667 --> 01:04:05,875
Bai.

706
01:04:06,125 --> 01:04:09,750
Who else survived the mutiny at Maweiyi?

707
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:14,791
Catch.

708
01:04:17,042 --> 01:04:18,875
Did any escape?

709
01:04:21,542 --> 01:04:23,250
Chao Heng? Who's that?

710
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:25,000
A Japanese, like you.

711
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:28,250
A senior envoy. He was here a long time.

712
01:04:30,042 --> 01:04:31,268
Abe no Nakamaro?

713
01:04:31,292 --> 01:04:32,375
That's the one!

714
01:04:32,792 --> 01:04:33,792
Oh.

715
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,166
He was at Maweiyi too?

716
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:42,000
Yes, but he died a long time ago.

717
01:04:42,167 --> 01:04:43,226
Because he's Japanese,

718
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:44,976
he had no records in the archives.

719
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,250
So I wrote "to be completed".

720
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:50,541
Did Abe have a home here?

721
01:04:51,667 --> 01:04:53,601
Yes, his widow Bai Ling is still alive.

722
01:04:53,625 --> 01:04:54,666
Shhh...

723
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:01,250
Hurry!

724
01:05:08,250 --> 01:05:09,375
You again.

725
01:05:10,792 --> 01:05:12,625
And who is this?

726
01:05:17,792 --> 01:05:19,250
Pardon us.

727
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,416
I'm Kukai, a shaman from Japan.

728
01:05:26,167 --> 01:05:27,250
This way.

729
01:05:27,542 --> 01:05:31,875
Did Mr Abe ever wish to return to Japan?

730
01:05:33,917 --> 01:05:38,417
He changed his mind at the last minute,

731
01:05:41,542 --> 01:05:44,500
watched his ship sail, and returned.

732
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:49,041
Then returned to Chang' an.

733
01:05:50,375 --> 01:05:51,666
Why?

734
01:05:57,375 --> 01:05:59,791
Because of a woman.

735
01:06:00,750 --> 01:06:05,250
He didn't know if she was alive or dead.

736
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:11,500
Did he ever find out?

737
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,750
I never asked.

738
01:06:18,667 --> 01:06:21,042
He was here a long time.

739
01:06:21,375 --> 01:06:23,625
Did he leave behind a journal?

740
01:06:24,042 --> 01:06:28,125
Yes. He asked me to burn it.

741
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:32,416
But you couldn't do it?

742
01:06:33,542 --> 01:06:38,042
No. Regretfully, I read it.

743
01:06:38,792 --> 01:06:43,292
That's how I knew he loved another.

744
01:06:47,625 --> 01:06:52,125
Yet you stayed. Aren't you lonely?

745
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:15,166
Why not give me the journal?

746
01:07:15,667 --> 01:07:19,750
Maybe I can release his soul

747
01:07:21,875 --> 01:07:25,500
and salve his troubled heart.

748
01:07:33,625 --> 01:07:36,250
Thirty years have passed.

749
01:07:37,625 --> 01:07:42,125
I still remember the first line.

750
01:07:44,375 --> 01:07:48,875
I'm a heartless man.

751
01:07:51,625 --> 01:07:54,476
I'm a heartless man,

752
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:58,250
besotted with the emperor's woman.

753
01:08:15,125 --> 01:08:17,666
Today is her birthday.

754
01:08:17,875 --> 01:08:20,000
All of Chang'an is astir.

755
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,916
To allow them a glimpse of her,

756
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:27,750
the emperor came up with this idea.

757
01:08:30,125 --> 01:08:33,625
Her exotic looks

758
01:08:33,792 --> 01:08:36,375
had won his love.

759
01:08:38,125 --> 01:08:40,875
It was an enlightened age,

760
01:08:41,125 --> 01:08:44,916
and she was its pride and joy, its symbol,

761
01:08:46,875 --> 01:08:50,625
to which all eyes were drawn.

762
01:09:14,167 --> 01:09:18,292
I will profess my love to her

763
01:09:18,792 --> 01:09:22,417
at her birthday feast tonight.

764
01:12:36,375 --> 01:12:38,125
Everyone says,

765
01:12:38,250 --> 01:12:41,625
all this is her idea.

766
01:12:42,375 --> 01:12:43,916
It's her vision

767
01:12:43,917 --> 01:12:48,250
of the Tang in all its glory.

768
01:12:49,792 --> 01:12:53,250
What a marvelous woman!

769
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:56,351
M'Lady, the emperor wants to know.

770
01:12:56,375 --> 01:12:58,601
Do you like his gift of this red robe?

771
01:12:58,625 --> 01:13:01,375
Do you like it or not?

772
01:13:02,167 --> 01:13:04,042
Where is the emperor?

773
01:13:22,125 --> 01:13:25,250
M'lord, M'lady. Watch this!

774
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,375
A tiger for M'Lord, flowers for M'lady!

775
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:59,791
I still prefer my cat.

776
01:14:00,792 --> 01:14:03,625
The illusionist was Yellow Crane,

777
01:14:04,125 --> 01:14:06,500
the realm's most famous magician.

778
01:14:07,542 --> 01:14:08,750
White Crane.

779
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Coming!

780
01:14:11,750 --> 01:14:13,000
I want to catch those flowers!

781
01:14:14,042 --> 01:14:15,000
Go.

782
01:14:19,792 --> 01:14:21,226
How rude!

783
01:14:21,250 --> 01:14:22,416
No rules tonight!

784
01:14:30,875 --> 01:14:32,125
Catch!

785
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:36,000
I'd never seen the two boys before.

786
01:14:36,625 --> 01:14:38,500
They were Yellow Crane's disciples.

787
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:42,791
Red Crane and White Crane.

788
01:15:06,167 --> 01:15:07,917
So there really was a cat?

789
01:15:08,667 --> 01:15:10,167
You reek of wine,

790
01:15:10,292 --> 01:15:12,042
you don't wash, your robes are filthy.

791
01:15:12,167 --> 01:15:16,667
Even dirty, I'm cleaner than you.

792
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:18,541
Get off.

793
01:15:23,125 --> 01:15:23,916
Li BO,

794
01:15:24,417 --> 01:15:28,292
wealth and rank is yours at last.

795
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:31,625
Who are you?

796
01:15:32,042 --> 01:15:33,417
What do you want?

797
01:15:33,750 --> 01:15:36,041
My name is Gao Lishi.

798
01:15:36,292 --> 01:15:39,042
His Majesty wants you to write a poem.

799
01:15:39,292 --> 01:15:40,667
What about?

800
01:15:41,667 --> 01:15:43,500
A great beauty.

801
01:15:45,792 --> 01:15:47,917
There aren't any.

802
01:15:49,167 --> 01:15:53,667
Sure there are. It's not so hard.

803
01:15:55,625 --> 01:15:59,041
No one tells me what to write.

804
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:01,416
Can't do.

805
01:16:01,667 --> 01:16:04,542
The Emperor isn't 'no one'.

806
01:16:04,917 --> 01:16:07,917
If he tells you to write, you write!

807
01:16:08,542 --> 01:16:12,792
Take off my boots and I'll do it.

808
01:16:16,792 --> 01:16:18,875
I only do that for the emperor!

809
01:16:19,417 --> 01:16:21,250
Lady Yang said

810
01:16:21,875 --> 01:16:26,375
at her birthday feast, all are equal.

811
01:16:27,417 --> 01:16:31,917
This is a test. So it's not true after all.

812
01:16:33,042 --> 01:16:33,917
Gao Lishi.

813
01:16:34,167 --> 01:16:34,667
Yes.

814
01:16:36,167 --> 01:16:39,417
You're disobeying her and the emperor!

815
01:16:50,875 --> 01:16:52,500
It's Lady Yang's hairpin.

816
01:16:52,917 --> 01:16:53,500
No!

817
01:16:54,667 --> 01:16:56,125
What are you looking at?

818
01:16:57,250 --> 01:16:59,125
So you're the Flying Cranes?

819
01:17:09,542 --> 01:17:10,375
Amazing.

820
01:17:10,875 --> 01:17:11,500
It's an illusion.

821
01:17:11,792 --> 01:17:12,667
It's nothing.

822
01:17:14,667 --> 01:17:17,792
Just "now you see it now you don't".

823
01:17:21,167 --> 01:17:23,000
Am I wrong?

824
01:17:24,417 --> 01:17:24,917
No.

825
01:17:25,042 --> 01:17:26,792
Give Lady Yang her hairpin.

826
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:30,541
Keep up.

827
01:17:32,125 --> 01:17:33,916
Now you see it now you don't.

828
01:17:35,875 --> 01:17:36,500
You're older?

829
01:17:37,042 --> 01:17:37,667
I am.

830
01:17:38,625 --> 01:17:40,875
Dad found him by the river

831
01:17:41,917 --> 01:17:44,375
and called him White Dragon.

832
01:17:46,125 --> 01:17:47,666
Don't lie to Lady Yang.

833
01:17:50,542 --> 01:17:51,875
My dad was a gambler.

834
01:17:53,042 --> 01:17:54,292
He sold me to Master Yellow Crane.

835
01:17:57,125 --> 01:17:58,250
The master is my father.

836
01:17:58,667 --> 01:17:59,375
Wait.

837
01:18:03,875 --> 01:18:05,166
Look at me.

838
01:18:09,542 --> 01:18:11,042
I was an orphan

839
01:18:12,417 --> 01:18:14,250
raised by my uncle.

840
01:18:15,667 --> 01:18:17,042
Living under another's roof

841
01:18:17,875 --> 01:18:20,624
made me grateful and beholden.

842
01:18:20,625 --> 01:18:22,416
Made me grateful and beholden.

843
01:18:24,542 --> 01:18:27,292
You're the same, yes?

844
01:18:29,542 --> 01:18:33,500
Only as a pair are you the Flying Cranes.

845
01:18:35,417 --> 01:18:37,375
Her robes, clouds...

846
01:18:38,667 --> 01:18:39,417
Come.

847
01:18:44,792 --> 01:18:46,851
Her face, flowers.

848
01:18:46,875 --> 01:18:50,791
Spring breezes, a dewy loveliness

849
01:19:00,375 --> 01:19:04,875
seen only in heaven's peaks

850
01:19:07,875 --> 01:19:12,375
and moonlight pavilions.

851
01:19:28,792 --> 01:19:30,375
Finished!

852
01:19:31,542 --> 01:19:33,125
No revisions?

853
01:19:35,375 --> 01:19:37,166
Not a word.

854
01:19:38,292 --> 01:19:40,042
What did you write?

855
01:19:40,542 --> 01:19:42,125
Is it good?

856
01:19:42,292 --> 01:19:43,625
See for yourself.

857
01:19:44,542 --> 01:19:46,167
Time for my nap.

858
01:20:13,625 --> 01:20:14,666
Bai!

859
01:20:22,417 --> 01:20:23,542
Li Bo's brush.

860
01:20:23,792 --> 01:20:25,167
The demon cat was right!

861
01:20:26,042 --> 01:20:27,393
Wake up!

862
01:20:27,417 --> 01:20:29,917
Lady Yang is here to see you.

863
01:20:41,667 --> 01:20:43,167
Thank you for my poem.

864
01:20:43,375 --> 01:20:44,375
Huh?

865
01:20:45,750 --> 01:20:47,916
Have I written you a poem?

866
01:20:48,292 --> 01:20:49,667
Which one's that?

867
01:20:53,542 --> 01:20:56,542
Her robes, clouds, her face, flowers.

868
01:20:57,542 --> 01:20:59,292
It's beautiful.

869
01:21:00,125 --> 01:21:02,791
You flatter me.

870
01:21:03,292 --> 01:21:04,667
It's not that great.

871
01:21:05,042 --> 01:21:08,417
Anyway, I didn't write it for you.

872
01:21:08,792 --> 01:21:11,792
Of course you did.

873
01:21:12,417 --> 01:21:15,792
If not for M'Lady, who was it for?

874
01:21:18,667 --> 01:21:21,000
I don't know,

875
01:21:21,875 --> 01:21:23,916
but I can't lie.

876
01:21:27,125 --> 01:21:29,541
Put on your shoes.

877
01:21:31,792 --> 01:21:33,042
Li Bo.

878
01:21:35,250 --> 01:21:38,791
You enrich our dynasty.

879
01:21:43,792 --> 01:21:48,292
Her robes, clouds, her face, flowers.

880
01:21:50,750 --> 01:21:52,541
Why's it written on your back?

881
01:21:53,167 --> 01:21:56,143
Did he write this on his own

882
01:21:56,167 --> 01:21:58,375
or did you make him do it?

883
01:21:59,750 --> 01:22:00,351
Your Majesty.

884
01:22:00,375 --> 01:22:01,375
Turn around.

885
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:03,041
Speak.

886
01:22:04,542 --> 01:22:07,917
It was Li Bo's idea.

887
01:22:08,917 --> 01:22:11,167
Lady Yang loves it.

888
01:22:11,792 --> 01:22:12,893
Should I reward him?

889
01:22:12,917 --> 01:22:14,500
Yes, richly.

890
01:22:16,167 --> 01:22:18,417
Have him exiled...

891
01:22:18,542 --> 01:22:20,542
for life.

892
01:22:23,625 --> 01:22:26,416
And your poem?

893
01:22:26,667 --> 01:22:30,042
Should I give it to M'Lady?

894
01:22:30,792 --> 01:22:32,167
No need.

895
01:22:56,667 --> 01:22:57,875
Abe!

896
01:22:58,792 --> 01:23:00,167
Why are you here?

897
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,416
To see me, I'm sure.

898
01:23:06,667 --> 01:23:10,042
We received your gift.

899
01:23:11,417 --> 01:23:12,667
Very nice.

900
01:23:14,917 --> 01:23:16,000
No.

901
01:23:17,042 --> 01:23:20,167
That's not why I'm here.

902
01:23:20,292 --> 01:23:22,167
I know why you're here.

903
01:23:26,042 --> 01:23:27,792
But remember...

904
01:23:28,750 --> 01:23:30,666
at no time

905
01:23:31,667 --> 01:23:36,167
will you find Lady Yang on her own.

906
01:23:42,792 --> 01:23:47,292
We're bound together for eternity.

907
01:23:55,042 --> 01:23:56,292
Let's go.

908
01:23:56,917 --> 01:24:00,500
The last guests are here.

909
01:24:01,542 --> 01:24:03,542
The emperor didn't kill me

910
01:24:04,292 --> 01:24:06,917
but his compassion and disdain

911
01:24:07,542 --> 01:24:10,167
slayed me in front of my beloved.

912
01:24:11,042 --> 01:24:13,542
He had written something.

913
01:24:13,667 --> 01:24:16,250
Abe the calligraphy is for you.

914
01:24:16,375 --> 01:24:18,166
Guess what it means.

915
01:24:19,250 --> 01:24:21,541
The Greatest Happiness.

916
01:24:21,875 --> 01:24:23,625
To control all others

917
01:24:24,125 --> 01:24:27,250
that was his "greatest happiness".

918
01:24:29,167 --> 01:24:33,667
The last to arrive was General An.

919
01:24:35,292 --> 01:24:38,375
The emperor welcomed him

920
01:24:39,250 --> 01:24:42,916
with a martial performance.

921
01:24:45,542 --> 01:24:49,792
He knew General An wanted to rebel

922
01:24:50,750 --> 01:24:55,250
but made him feel special.

923
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:09,000
He was ruler of the world and trusting.

924
01:25:10,667 --> 01:25:13,542
Above the fray.

925
01:25:41,917 --> 01:25:43,417
This is Yanqiu Gate.

926
01:25:43,542 --> 01:25:44,976
Ten days after the feast,

927
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,666
general An rebelled.

928
01:25:47,292 --> 01:25:48,768
At first, Emperor Li stayed put.

929
01:25:48,792 --> 01:25:50,893
But An wanted Lady Yang

930
01:25:50,917 --> 01:25:53,167
so they fled Chang' an.

931
01:25:54,292 --> 01:25:57,542
100,000 went with him.

932
01:26:37,375 --> 01:26:39,666
I'm still the emperor!

933
01:26:45,375 --> 01:26:47,666
During the escape,

934
01:26:47,917 --> 01:26:50,417
the imperial guards

935
01:26:50,625 --> 01:26:53,291
mutinied at Maweiyi.

936
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:57,041
They said only Lady Yang's death

937
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,916
would end the rebellion

938
01:27:01,875 --> 01:27:03,416
and bring peace.

939
01:27:06,667 --> 01:27:09,500
Eunuch Gao has returned.

940
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,625
Open the doors.

941
01:27:27,792 --> 01:27:30,417
The head of Lady Yang's brother.

942
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:40,207
Now Captain Chen wants Lady Yang's head.

943
01:27:40,208 --> 01:27:42,666
Now Captain Chen wants Lady Yang's head.

944
01:27:45,792 --> 01:27:47,542
Impossible!

945
01:27:48,417 --> 01:27:52,917
Then he can't promise his loyalty.

946
01:27:59,375 --> 01:28:00,375
Your Majesty...

947
01:28:01,292 --> 01:28:02,833
What is it?

948
01:28:11,417 --> 01:28:13,167
Try.

949
01:28:13,917 --> 01:28:15,417
But it's unlikely.

950
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,125
Yellow Crane.

951
01:28:32,167 --> 01:28:36,667
M'Lady, a word in private?

952
01:28:40,792 --> 01:28:44,875
You want to take me to Japan?

953
01:28:45,042 --> 01:28:46,917
It's also the emperor's idea.

954
01:28:47,125 --> 01:28:52,208
The rebels killed your brother.

955
01:28:55,792 --> 01:28:57,792
It's all my fault.

956
01:28:58,417 --> 01:29:02,917
But if I go, they'll kill the emperor.

957
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:07,291
If you don't, they'll kill you.

958
01:29:13,792 --> 01:29:14,625
Abe,

959
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:15,666
Yes?

960
01:29:16,625 --> 01:29:18,416
You've been here a long time.

961
01:29:19,750 --> 01:29:22,416
Time to go home.

962
01:29:24,292 --> 01:29:26,167
But not with me.

963
01:29:37,542 --> 01:29:39,042
Abe!

964
01:29:39,792 --> 01:29:40,458
M'Lady.

965
01:29:43,667 --> 01:29:48,167
You had something else to say to me?

966
01:29:52,625 --> 01:29:55,791
Towards the end of the feast.

967
01:29:56,292 --> 01:30:00,792
Lady Yang foresaw her fate.

968
01:30:04,042 --> 01:30:08,542
She'd been the glory of the dynasty.

969
01:30:10,167 --> 01:30:14,667
In crisis, it no longer needed her.

970
01:30:19,792 --> 01:30:21,625
At Maweiyi,

971
01:30:21,917 --> 01:30:25,417
she craved all words of love.

972
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,500
She knew

973
01:30:28,917 --> 01:30:30,917
as death approached

974
01:30:31,792 --> 01:30:36,292
they could be... the last.

975
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:43,416
I understand.

976
01:30:45,042 --> 01:30:46,917
It's all in your eyes.

977
01:30:49,917 --> 01:30:51,750
I'm content.

978
01:30:54,542 --> 01:30:56,667
The rebels had killed her family.

979
01:30:57,250 --> 01:31:00,416
If they took her too,
or she killed herself,

980
01:31:01,292 --> 01:31:03,417
the helpless emperor

981
01:31:05,417 --> 01:31:07,375
would be doomed as well.

982
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:10,625
If she went to Japan, the rebels

983
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,291
would've killed him.

984
01:31:15,167 --> 01:31:18,667
For the sake of his dignity and safety

985
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:24,000
she could neither live nor die.

986
01:31:27,250 --> 01:31:30,666
You're saying there's a third way?

987
01:31:31,542 --> 01:31:34,417
I have an foolproof plan

988
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:40,500
to save the emperor and M'Lady too.

989
01:31:44,417 --> 01:31:46,458
Red Crane, lie down.

990
01:32:06,333 --> 01:32:10,833
I call this the "lmm0rtal Path".

991
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,166
It resembles hibernation.

992
01:32:15,042 --> 01:32:18,458
I can put M'Lady into a deep sleep.

993
01:32:19,375 --> 01:32:20,541
One needle

994
01:32:20,792 --> 01:32:23,625
stops the pulse, breath

995
01:32:24,542 --> 01:32:26,333
and heartbeat.

996
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:31,166
It fools the gods themselves.

997
01:32:31,375 --> 01:32:33,958
Hence the "Immortal Path"!

998
01:32:38,417 --> 01:32:39,917
Then what?

999
01:32:40,125 --> 01:32:42,583
Though she won't be breathing,

1000
01:32:43,083 --> 01:32:45,249
she'll come to no harm.

1001
01:32:45,458 --> 01:32:47,166
Neither will she age.

1002
01:32:47,500 --> 01:32:50,541
We seal her Qi inside her body.

1003
01:32:54,833 --> 01:32:59,333
I won't let him do this to you.

1004
01:32:59,875 --> 01:33:00,666
Your Majesty.

1005
01:33:03,708 --> 01:33:04,583
Your Majesty

1006
01:33:05,208 --> 01:33:06,291
look!

1007
01:33:11,792 --> 01:33:13,417
You're awake?

1008
01:33:13,917 --> 01:33:15,250
Sit up.

1009
01:33:26,625 --> 01:33:29,625
The Qi isn't yet in full flow.

1010
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,291
He just needs a short rest.

1011
01:33:37,083 --> 01:33:41,124
It's the only way to save her.

1012
01:33:41,292 --> 01:33:45,042
Say you put her into a deep sleep.

1013
01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:47,625
What next?

1014
01:33:48,250 --> 01:33:49,708
Seal and bury the coffin.

1015
01:33:50,958 --> 01:33:52,541
Wait till things settle.

1016
01:33:53,167 --> 01:33:54,458
Open it, extract the needle

1017
01:33:54,917 --> 01:33:56,792
and welcome her back!

1018
01:34:04,583 --> 01:34:06,333
Will she suffer?

1019
01:34:07,250 --> 01:34:08,666
There's no pain.

1020
01:34:15,250 --> 01:34:16,750
My love

1021
01:34:17,292 --> 01:34:21,333
I'd rather see Eunuch Gao

1022
01:34:21,875 --> 01:34:23,625
take my head on a platter

1023
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:29,500
than break my vows to you.

1024
01:34:32,917 --> 01:34:34,833
I won't let you bury her alive!

1025
01:34:50,958 --> 01:34:55,374
My love, will you do it?

1026
01:34:56,083 --> 01:34:58,499
He was going to bury her alive.

1027
01:35:45,833 --> 01:35:48,333
Yellow Crane put the needle in.

1028
01:35:49,625 --> 01:35:53,791
Soon she stopped breathing

1029
01:35:56,042 --> 01:35:58,000
and seemed to be dead.

1030
01:36:09,833 --> 01:36:14,041
What will you tell Captain Chen?

1031
01:36:15,125 --> 01:36:18,166
I gave him the white execution scarf.

1032
01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:21,625
But she has no bruises on her neck.

1033
01:36:22,042 --> 01:36:24,333
Chen won't fall for it.

1034
01:36:25,042 --> 01:36:27,917
Eunuch Gao, you do it.

1035
01:36:32,750 --> 01:36:36,750
So... I'll be punished for her murder?

1036
01:36:37,583 --> 01:36:42,041
And you did it behind His Majesty's back.

1037
01:37:46,667 --> 01:37:51,042
I did it for you, Your Majesty.

1038
01:37:51,292 --> 01:37:54,750
I did it for you.

1039
01:38:00,875 --> 01:38:03,875
The emperor convinced Captain Chen

1040
01:38:04,375 --> 01:38:06,250
that Lady Yang was dead.

1041
01:38:19,125 --> 01:38:22,666
He was the real master of illusion!

1042
01:38:23,125 --> 01:38:26,875
I said nothing.

1043
01:38:28,917 --> 01:38:30,417
You're saying...

1044
01:38:31,042 --> 01:38:33,167
they never planned to revive her.

1045
01:38:33,417 --> 01:38:37,083
They tricked her into agreeing?

1046
01:38:39,792 --> 01:38:41,667
What other kind of death

1047
01:38:43,792 --> 01:38:46,542
would leave her so peaceful

1048
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:51,351
with a heart full of love and hope?

1049
01:38:51,375 --> 01:38:55,875
Long live Emperor Li and Lady Yang!

1050
01:39:12,375 --> 01:39:16,875
She was buried in an ancient tomb.

1051
01:39:21,083 --> 01:39:25,583
All who knew about it would be killed.

1052
01:39:28,125 --> 01:39:30,041
I was no exception.

1053
01:39:32,333 --> 01:39:36,833
Only the cat would keep her company.

1054
01:39:40,958 --> 01:39:43,333
If you are reading my diary

1055
01:39:45,208 --> 01:39:46,249
remember...

1056
01:39:48,167 --> 01:39:51,625
to get to the tomb

1057
01:39:52,583 --> 01:39:55,708
cross the drowned forest.

1058
01:40:00,875 --> 01:40:02,500
In her last moments

1059
01:40:03,083 --> 01:40:06,291
she still didn't know the truth

1060
01:40:07,208 --> 01:40:08,041
right?

1061
01:40:12,333 --> 01:40:13,541
She knew.

1062
01:40:15,500 --> 01:40:17,666
She saw his dilemma.

1063
01:40:18,750 --> 01:40:22,416
She sacrificed herself to help him.

1064
01:40:22,917 --> 01:40:25,375
If she knew that

1065
01:40:26,292 --> 01:40:28,542
when they said goodbye.

1066
01:40:28,917 --> 01:40:31,542
Why give him a lock of her hair?

1067
01:40:34,208 --> 01:40:35,958
Did she still love him?

1068
01:40:36,375 --> 01:40:39,916
Maybe she thought this was love

1069
01:40:41,542 --> 01:40:43,833
to make the ultimate sacrifice.

1070
01:40:44,458 --> 01:40:46,499
I should burn my poem.

1071
01:40:50,042 --> 01:40:52,042
I want to visit her tomb.

1072
01:40:53,167 --> 01:40:56,542
I want to know the truth.

1073
01:41:13,833 --> 01:41:14,749
This is it.

1074
01:41:17,083 --> 01:41:17,999
Come in.

1075
01:41:19,958 --> 01:41:21,791
Who opened the stone door?

1076
01:41:22,167 --> 01:41:23,833
Someone was here first.

1077
01:41:37,583 --> 01:41:38,416
Kukai!

1078
01:41:41,125 --> 01:41:42,643
They've moved the lid.

1079
01:41:42,667 --> 01:41:43,417
Huh?

1080
01:41:44,917 --> 01:41:46,542
The lid is askew.

1081
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,125
Give me a hand!

1082
01:41:52,292 --> 01:41:52,917
Push!

1083
01:41:57,250 --> 01:41:58,041
I don't dare look.

1084
01:41:58,208 --> 01:41:58,958
I don't want to look.

1085
01:41:59,250 --> 01:42:00,125
Bai!

1086
01:42:07,292 --> 01:42:08,333
Kukai!

1087
01:42:09,583 --> 01:42:11,684
Maybe we were both wrong.

1088
01:42:11,708 --> 01:42:14,166
Maybe the "lmm0rtal Path" was real.

1089
01:42:19,917 --> 01:42:20,851
What're you doing?

1090
01:42:20,875 --> 01:42:21,958
Give me the candle.

1091
01:42:23,583 --> 01:42:24,833
Close the lid.

1092
01:42:25,583 --> 01:42:26,458
You're insane!

1093
01:42:28,125 --> 01:42:29,333
Close it.

1094
01:42:40,917 --> 01:42:41,684
Bai.

1095
01:42:41,708 --> 01:42:43,917
Kukai!

1096
01:43:11,792 --> 01:43:12,792
What's this?

1097
01:43:15,292 --> 01:43:16,917
Blood from her fingers.

1098
01:43:18,667 --> 01:43:20,375
She wasn't dead!

1099
01:43:24,583 --> 01:43:27,583
She tried to escape, but couldn't.

1100
01:43:27,750 --> 01:43:28,583
That's right.

1101
01:43:34,917 --> 01:43:37,333
She woke up inside!

1102
01:43:40,458 --> 01:43:41,624
You're White Crane?

1103
01:43:45,042 --> 01:43:46,167
And Lady Yang?

1104
01:43:47,042 --> 01:43:48,042
Where is she?

1105
01:43:48,500 --> 01:43:50,000
You got it.

1106
01:43:50,667 --> 01:43:51,833
Kukai.

1107
01:43:53,375 --> 01:43:56,083
She knew it was a lie.

1108
01:43:57,042 --> 01:43:59,750
But didn't know she'd wake up,

1109
01:44:00,250 --> 01:44:04,583
or how long it would take to die.

1110
01:44:30,500 --> 01:44:35,000
Is this vision you and Red Crane?

1111
01:44:56,542 --> 01:44:58,667
On the second night of the mutiny.

1112
01:45:00,208 --> 01:45:03,541
Guards took the emperor away.

1113
01:45:04,625 --> 01:45:08,541
Red Crane and I escaped
the slaughter and snuck back

1114
01:45:09,625 --> 01:45:11,458
to save Lady Yang.

1115
01:45:16,542 --> 01:45:17,958
M'Lady.

1116
01:45:34,458 --> 01:45:35,791
She was still alive?!

1117
01:45:52,125 --> 01:45:53,351
She's dead.

1118
01:45:53,375 --> 01:45:53,958
Shhh...

1119
01:45:54,667 --> 01:45:57,542
The magic makes her look alive.

1120
01:45:59,958 --> 01:46:02,249
It can't bring her back to life.

1121
01:46:03,542 --> 01:46:05,042
What do you mean?

1122
01:46:05,542 --> 01:46:06,917
The master said so.

1123
01:46:07,833 --> 01:46:09,601
You just have to pull out the needle.

1124
01:46:09,625 --> 01:46:12,541
He said that to fool her.

1125
01:46:13,583 --> 01:46:16,208
Who'd want to be known as her killer?

1126
01:46:16,583 --> 01:46:18,666
Not even the emperor!

1127
01:46:21,042 --> 01:46:23,458
So Dad invented the "Immortal Path".

1128
01:46:27,167 --> 01:46:28,833
How do you know?

1129
01:46:29,250 --> 01:46:31,500
They talked about it at Maweiyi Station.

1130
01:46:31,667 --> 01:46:32,583
Yellow Crane!

1131
01:46:33,583 --> 01:46:34,708
Talked about what?

1132
01:46:35,208 --> 01:46:37,166
How to trick Lady Yang!

1133
01:46:39,208 --> 01:46:41,208
But

1134
01:46:42,042 --> 01:46:44,375
you stopped breathing.

1135
01:46:45,750 --> 01:46:49,416
You can seal off Qi for two days.

1136
01:46:52,292 --> 01:46:54,667
Then the person wakes up.

1137
01:46:56,542 --> 01:46:58,417
I thought the wine

1138
01:46:59,375 --> 01:47:00,875
would prevent her waking.

1139
01:47:01,417 --> 01:47:02,250
What was the wine?

1140
01:47:04,042 --> 01:47:05,083
Immortal Path wine.

1141
01:47:05,792 --> 01:47:07,125
I prepared it myself.

1142
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:09,333
Dad added demon worms.

1143
01:47:09,792 --> 01:47:11,292
Why didn't you tell me?

1144
01:47:11,917 --> 01:47:13,667
I only found out later.

1145
01:47:15,167 --> 01:47:16,809
You visited the tomb with me.

1146
01:47:16,833 --> 01:47:18,958
He's my dad! I couldn't betray him.

1147
01:47:24,250 --> 01:47:26,375
You still went with me to the tomb.

1148
01:47:28,542 --> 01:47:30,208
What did you hope to see?

1149
01:47:31,458 --> 01:47:32,916
You're as evil as them.

1150
01:47:34,042 --> 01:47:35,000
Get lost.

1151
01:47:39,917 --> 01:47:41,125
White Crane.

1152
01:47:45,417 --> 01:47:47,375
Who do you have in the world

1153
01:47:49,292 --> 01:47:50,583
besides me?

1154
01:47:52,583 --> 01:47:53,791
I have her.

1155
01:47:54,958 --> 01:47:56,583
She will wake up!

1156
01:48:00,208 --> 01:48:02,499
Red Crane never returned?

1157
01:48:07,458 --> 01:48:08,499
White Crane.

1158
01:48:10,083 --> 01:48:14,333
The Lady Yang we knew is dead.

1159
01:48:15,917 --> 01:48:18,125
I'm as upset as you.

1160
01:48:20,417 --> 01:48:22,458
How can men be so evil?

1161
01:48:24,958 --> 01:48:27,624
I want to end this suffering.

1162
01:49:05,208 --> 01:49:06,624
After that?

1163
01:49:07,625 --> 01:49:08,875
What happened?

1164
01:49:27,250 --> 01:49:29,041
You needed raw meat!

1165
01:49:29,292 --> 01:49:31,375
I know.

1166
01:50:48,750 --> 01:50:50,541
I can't die.

1167
01:50:51,042 --> 01:50:53,792
If I did, she'd have no one!

1168
01:52:03,167 --> 01:52:04,625
Your spirit entered the cat.

1169
01:52:04,792 --> 01:52:07,375
You'll never be human again.

1170
01:52:09,042 --> 01:52:10,625
Fine with me.

1171
01:52:42,917 --> 01:52:47,417
Once inside the body of the cat

1172
01:52:48,500 --> 01:52:51,166
his memory became mine.

1173
01:52:52,250 --> 01:52:53,791
Suddenly...

1174
01:52:54,542 --> 01:52:58,667
I heard Lady Yang's desperate screams.

1175
01:53:47,417 --> 01:53:49,542
How'd you get back here?

1176
01:53:57,167 --> 01:54:00,042
Weren't you protecting Lady Yang?

1177
01:54:01,417 --> 01:54:03,500
I was protecting her!

1178
01:54:04,792 --> 01:54:07,000
But I got hungry.

1179
01:54:08,750 --> 01:54:13,250
And no fish eyes to eat there.

1180
01:54:41,125 --> 01:54:43,250
But everyone thought

1181
01:54:44,250 --> 01:54:47,291
he went blind weeping for her.

1182
01:54:48,917 --> 01:54:52,667
He lied, but he knew the truth.

1183
01:54:54,375 --> 01:54:57,416
You need to write that in your poem.

1184
01:54:58,417 --> 01:55:00,500
Or I'll kill you too.

1185
01:55:01,542 --> 01:55:03,268
You've already killed so many.

1186
01:55:03,292 --> 01:55:04,417
Many?

1187
01:55:08,167 --> 01:55:11,125
Three generations and I'm not done yet.

1188
01:55:12,792 --> 01:55:15,667
Your final target is Red Crane.

1189
01:55:16,292 --> 01:55:17,292
That's right.

1190
01:55:17,625 --> 01:55:18,750
And Lady Yang?

1191
01:55:19,417 --> 01:55:20,500
Where is she?

1192
01:55:24,375 --> 01:55:25,875
Is she still alive?

1193
01:55:27,667 --> 01:55:30,292
Tell me. Is she still alive?

1194
01:55:32,417 --> 01:55:33,917
She will wake up!

1195
01:55:39,375 --> 01:55:41,791
How long can you lie to yourself?

1196
01:56:47,417 --> 01:56:49,250
The melon magician?

1197
01:56:49,500 --> 01:56:50,541
What does he want?

1198
01:56:51,042 --> 01:56:53,125
He invited us to the banquet.

1199
01:57:09,417 --> 01:57:11,542
Just you two?

1200
01:57:12,542 --> 01:57:14,292
There'll be others.

1201
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:05,916
That's Li Bo!

1202
01:58:06,542 --> 01:58:08,917
Lady Yang might speak to us tonight.

1203
01:58:11,292 --> 01:58:12,167
No way.

1204
01:58:12,625 --> 01:58:13,291
Bet?

1205
01:58:14,042 --> 01:58:14,917
Sure.

1206
01:58:18,792 --> 01:58:20,042
It's Lady Yang's jade hairpin.

1207
01:58:23,542 --> 01:58:25,917
So you're the Flying Cranes.

1208
01:58:31,167 --> 01:58:32,042
Red Crane.

1209
01:58:32,917 --> 01:58:34,417
Still playing with magic?

1210
01:58:36,125 --> 01:58:38,791
I knew it was you who took us back there.

1211
01:58:39,042 --> 01:58:41,542
I wanted to relive that time.

1212
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,666
The golden era of the Flying Cranes.

1213
01:58:46,417 --> 01:58:48,917
The Flying Cranes are no more.

1214
01:58:50,667 --> 01:58:54,042
Yet Lady Yang is eternal.

1215
01:59:24,875 --> 01:59:25,875
Is she still alive?

1216
01:59:26,167 --> 01:59:27,375
Kukai!

1217
01:59:31,667 --> 01:59:33,625
I've guarded her for thirty years!

1218
01:59:34,125 --> 01:59:35,541
No one is to touch her!

1219
01:59:36,500 --> 01:59:38,791
I know you hated me for leaving.

1220
01:59:39,542 --> 01:59:41,792
But I've been with you all along.

1221
01:59:43,667 --> 01:59:45,292
See who that is?

1222
01:59:49,292 --> 01:59:53,417
I laid out your body in a frozen cave,

1223
01:59:53,792 --> 01:59:55,917
waiting for this day to come.

1224
02:00:01,500 --> 02:00:03,541
That is all I ever wanted.

1225
02:00:04,542 --> 02:00:05,750
I have no regrets.

1226
02:00:08,542 --> 02:00:12,500
I haven't inhabited that body for years.

1227
02:00:13,125 --> 02:00:14,125
White Crane.

1228
02:00:15,375 --> 02:00:18,375
Lady Yang would tell you

1229
02:00:19,375 --> 02:00:22,250
she's no longer in her body either.

1230
02:00:33,292 --> 02:00:35,500
Kill me now if you like.

1231
02:01:22,792 --> 02:01:24,875
I knew she was dead.

1232
02:01:25,917 --> 02:01:28,042
I just couldn't let her go.

1233
02:02:43,417 --> 02:02:45,292
I'm going back to Japan.

1234
02:02:47,167 --> 02:02:47,917
Oh.

1235
02:02:48,875 --> 02:02:51,166
What about the Tantric teachings?

1236
02:02:51,667 --> 02:02:54,125
I found in the story of Lady Yang

1237
02:02:54,417 --> 02:02:56,542
the greatest teachings of all.

1238
02:02:57,750 --> 02:03:00,416
It's in 'Song of Everlasting Sorrow' too.

1239
02:03:00,667 --> 02:03:01,792
Oh.

1240
02:03:02,125 --> 02:03:03,416
It's finished?

1241
02:03:04,042 --> 02:03:05,792
I'm not changing a word!

1242
02:03:06,625 --> 02:03:08,875
You wanted it to tell the true story.

1243
02:03:09,125 --> 02:03:10,416
The emotions are true.

1244
02:03:10,542 --> 02:03:11,917
White Crane showed us that.

1245
02:03:21,042 --> 02:03:23,125
But he's not in your poem.

1246
02:03:24,417 --> 02:03:27,518
He wrote it, not me.

1247
02:03:27,542 --> 02:03:28,792
That's how it is.

1248
02:03:31,667 --> 02:03:32,500
I'm off.

1249
02:03:32,917 --> 02:03:34,125
For that alone

1250
02:03:35,292 --> 02:03:37,500
you surpass Li Bo!

1251
02:04:00,875 --> 02:04:04,375
I would try the temple a second time.

1252
02:04:05,042 --> 02:04:09,125
To my surprise, the doors opened.

1253
02:04:25,917 --> 02:04:27,542
Master Huiguo is waiting for you!

1254
02:04:28,542 --> 02:04:30,375
He says you know him.

1255
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:49,666
Kukai?

1256
02:04:55,167 --> 02:04:56,417
Red Crane,

1257
02:04:57,250 --> 02:04:58,291
we meet again.

1258
02:05:03,417 --> 02:05:05,042
Did you find the secret key

1259
02:05:05,625 --> 02:05:07,125
to bring suffering to an end?
