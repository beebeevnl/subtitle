1
00:01:50,368 --> 00:01:53,135
<i>If I spoke about it...</i>

2
00:01:53,137 --> 00:01:54,706
<i>If I did...</i>

3
00:01:55,538 --> 00:01:57,973
<i>what would I tell you?</i>

4
00:01:57,975 --> 00:01:59,343
<i>I wonder.</i>

5
00:02:01,411 --> 00:02:03,846
<i>Would I tell you
about the time?</i>

6
00:02:03,848 --> 00:02:06,581
<i>It happened a long time ago,
it seems...</i>

7
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:09,786
<i>in the last days
of a fair prince's reign.</i>

8
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:13,791
<i>Or would I tell you
about the place?</i>

9
00:02:14,692 --> 00:02:17,426
<i>A small city near the coast...</i>

10
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:19,797
<i>but far from everything else.</i>

11
00:02:23,233 --> 00:02:25,102
<i>Or, I don't know.</i>

12
00:02:26,335 --> 00:02:28,606
<i>Would I tell you about her?</i>

13
00:02:29,773 --> 00:02:32,143
<i>The princess without voice.</i>

14
00:02:34,477 --> 00:02:36,612
<i>Or perhaps
I would just warn you</i>

15
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,583
<i>about the truth
of these facts...</i>

16
00:02:40,184 --> 00:02:42,053
<i>and the tale
of love and loss...</i>

17
00:02:43,587 --> 00:02:48,626
<i>and the monster who tried
to destroy it all.</i>

18
00:03:42,179 --> 00:03:43,678
<i>My Lord Hedak.</i>

19
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,416
<i>So, you are troubled.
Tell me.</i>

20
00:03:50,253 --> 00:03:51,953
<i>I've...</i>

21
00:03:51,955 --> 00:03:55,756
<i>I have sinned.
I've offended the god.</i>

22
00:03:55,758 --> 00:03:57,691
<i>I am deep in sin,
my Lord Hedak.</i>

23
00:03:57,693 --> 00:03:59,261
<i>Let me judge of that.</i>

24
00:04:01,698 --> 00:04:04,867
<i>I've doubted the ceremony
of the sacrifice.</i>

25
00:05:23,547 --> 00:05:25,446
<i>I don't want to go up there.</i>

26
00:05:25,448 --> 00:05:28,316
<i>Why, everybody's got
to go upstairs, Miss Lloyd,</i>

27
00:05:28,318 --> 00:05:30,819
<i>if they wants to go to bed.</i>

28
00:05:30,821 --> 00:05:34,056
The sirens wake you up?
There was a fire.

29
00:05:34,058 --> 00:05:35,960
The chocolate factory.

30
00:05:38,261 --> 00:05:39,627
Do you smell that?

31
00:05:39,629 --> 00:05:41,463
Oh, my!

32
00:05:41,465 --> 00:05:42,833
Toasted cocoa.

33
00:05:43,667 --> 00:05:46,604
Tragedy and delight,
hand in hand.

34
00:05:47,737 --> 00:05:50,405
Oh, my dear child.

35
00:05:50,407 --> 00:05:53,574
I would waste away if you
weren't here looking after me.

36
00:05:53,576 --> 00:05:55,677
I am the proverbial
starving...

37
00:05:55,679 --> 00:05:58,013
Watch this.

38
00:05:58,015 --> 00:06:00,651
It's Bojangles,
the stair dance.

39
00:06:01,585 --> 00:06:04,752
Oh, that's so hard.
Cagney did it.

40
00:06:04,754 --> 00:06:06,222
Different, but beautiful.

41
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,891
<i>- I wanna do that, too.
- All right!</i>

42
00:06:09,893 --> 00:06:11,359
<i>- Are you ready?
- Yup.</i>

43
00:06:11,361 --> 00:06:12,559
<i>Come on.</i>

44
00:06:12,561 --> 00:06:15,066
<i>Ah!</i>

45
00:06:16,566 --> 00:06:18,335
<i>Say, you catch on quick.</i>

46
00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:21,638
<i>Look out now.
Here's your last one!</i>

47
00:06:56,939 --> 00:06:57,807
Elisa!

48
00:06:58,741 --> 00:07:00,708
Next time you come
to bring the rent...

49
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:03,845
I want you to stay
and see the Bible movie, huh!

50
00:07:03,847 --> 00:07:05,446
I have... I have two
free tickets here.

51
00:07:05,448 --> 00:07:08,182
You bring your neighbor Giles.
He's a good boy.

52
00:07:08,184 --> 00:07:09,653
Bible movie and comedy!

53
00:07:10,487 --> 00:07:11,585
Nobody's coming
to the theater, huh?

54
00:07:11,587 --> 00:07:15,023
I'll throw in a free
popcorn and soda!

55
00:07:15,025 --> 00:07:15,990
Oh, no!

56
00:07:15,992 --> 00:07:17,992
For God's sake,
there are two "S's" there!

57
00:07:17,994 --> 00:07:22,062
Come on! Two "S."
"Mardi Grass!" "Mardi Grass!"

58
00:07:22,064 --> 00:07:23,131
Two "S."

59
00:08:27,696 --> 00:08:29,797
<i>All new personnel,
be advised that sector 12</i>

60
00:08:29,799 --> 00:08:31,667
<i>has now been cleared
to level A safety.</i>

61
00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:35,435
Elisa! Come on.
I'm here already.

62
00:08:35,437 --> 00:08:36,703
You gotta learn to be on time.

63
00:08:36,705 --> 00:08:39,373
Hey! What are you doing?
Don't cut in, dummy!

64
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,510
Leave her alone, woman.
I was keeping her place.

65
00:08:41,512 --> 00:08:44,512
I get reported, I come
after you and the mute.

66
00:08:44,514 --> 00:08:47,350
You do that, Yolanda.
You do that.

67
00:09:00,797 --> 00:09:03,731
My feet are already
killing me.

68
00:09:03,733 --> 00:09:05,799
I made Brewster
pigs in a blanket

69
00:09:05,801 --> 00:09:07,602
tonight before leaving...

70
00:09:07,604 --> 00:09:10,604
and boy, he just ate 'em up.

71
00:09:10,606 --> 00:09:13,141
No "thank-yous",
no "yum-yums".

72
00:09:13,143 --> 00:09:14,976
Not a peep.

73
00:09:14,978 --> 00:09:17,578
Man is as silent as a grave.

74
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,014
But if farts were flattery...

75
00:09:20,016 --> 00:09:22,851
honey, he'd be Shakespeare.

76
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:25,219
Then I get home
and I make him breakfast.

77
00:09:25,221 --> 00:09:27,756
Eggs, bacon,
and buttered toast.

78
00:09:27,758 --> 00:09:29,790
I butter
the man's toast, Elisa.

79
00:09:29,792 --> 00:09:31,458
Mmm-hmm, both sides....

80
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,861
as if he was a child.

81
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:35,130
And I don't even
get a thank-you.

82
00:09:35,132 --> 00:09:37,232
You'd be grateful

83
00:09:37,234 --> 00:09:39,099
because you're
an educated woman.

84
00:09:39,101 --> 00:09:40,968
But my Brewster,
all he had going for him

85
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:43,170
was animal magnetism
back in the day.

86
00:09:43,172 --> 00:09:45,540
Hasn't worked in a while.

87
00:09:45,542 --> 00:09:48,275
What in the Sam Hill? No!

88
00:09:48,277 --> 00:09:50,711
You boys mind putting
the trash in the can?

89
00:09:50,713 --> 00:09:52,249
That's what it's there for.

90
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:55,817
Hard to believe, huh?
That's what it's there for.

91
00:09:55,819 --> 00:09:57,452
All right, all right.
Sorry, Zelda! Sorry!

92
00:09:57,454 --> 00:09:59,087
I don't know
what they're doing.

93
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:00,988
Making a goddamn mess
is what I think.

94
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:03,492
Zelda!
Stop that chatter, please.

95
00:10:03,494 --> 00:10:04,659
Yes, sir.

96
00:10:04,661 --> 00:10:06,928
There's no call
for the blasphemy.

97
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:08,866
Sorry, Mr. Fleming, sir.

98
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,233
A moment of your time!

99
00:10:13,235 --> 00:10:15,503
Today, we are receiving
a new team

100
00:10:15,505 --> 00:10:17,704
and asset here in T-4.

101
00:10:17,706 --> 00:10:19,040
This is Dr. Robert Hoffstetler

102
00:10:19,042 --> 00:10:21,142
from our sister facility
in Galveston.

103
00:10:21,144 --> 00:10:25,347
Now, I don't wanna bolster
or overstate the matter

104
00:10:25,349 --> 00:10:29,117
but this may very well be
the most sensitive asset

105
00:10:29,119 --> 00:10:31,953
ever to be housed
in this facility.

106
00:10:49,572 --> 00:10:53,006
- How was your trip?
- Fine. Who's security here?

107
00:10:53,008 --> 00:10:55,012
Just one moment, please.

108
00:10:56,278 --> 00:10:59,514
Security! Who's security?

109
00:10:59,516 --> 00:11:01,183
Welcome to T-4, sir.

110
00:11:01,185 --> 00:11:03,284
Yes, sir, I am Fleming,
head of Security.

111
00:11:03,286 --> 00:11:05,652
And if there are questions
you have or concerns...

112
00:11:05,654 --> 00:11:06,954
you just come talk to me.

113
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:20,403
Do you understand?
I'll be in charge from now on.

114
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:36,253
Get them out.

115
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,655
Help me move this
cylinder into the compressor.

116
00:11:44,594 --> 00:11:46,196
Bring it here.
Bring it here.

117
00:11:49,898 --> 00:11:52,333
Bring it over here.
There. Mount the cylinder.

118
00:11:52,335 --> 00:11:53,934
We need to pressurize it
immediately.

119
00:11:53,936 --> 00:11:56,407
- From there to there.
- Elisa! Elisa!

120
00:11:57,273 --> 00:11:58,707
Come on!

121
00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:00,875
Lord, what goes on
in this place?

122
00:12:00,877 --> 00:12:01,943
Did you see that?

123
00:12:21,931 --> 00:12:23,430
Yes, I'm wearing
the hairpiece.

124
00:12:23,432 --> 00:12:24,365
How does it look?

125
00:12:24,367 --> 00:12:27,003
Oh! Be careful of the car.

126
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:29,871
And it's not a hairpiece.

127
00:12:29,873 --> 00:12:32,008
It's a toupee. It's French.

128
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:34,742
<i>It's eternal, see?</i>

129
00:12:34,744 --> 00:12:38,179
Tantalus never achieved
the escape of death....

130
00:12:38,181 --> 00:12:39,881
because the fruit
on the branches

131
00:12:39,883 --> 00:12:42,083
was just always
out of his reach...

132
00:12:42,085 --> 00:12:43,785
and the water
in the stream receded

133
00:12:43,787 --> 00:12:45,587
every time he
stooped down to drink.

134
00:12:45,589 --> 00:12:48,323
And so that's why
we say things today like...

135
00:12:50,827 --> 00:12:52,894
"Look at those
tantalizing pies."

136
00:12:52,896 --> 00:12:56,032
Thank you!
Y'all come back now, you hear?

137
00:12:56,766 --> 00:12:58,565
Yes, pies for breakfast.

138
00:12:58,567 --> 00:13:00,136
Just trust me on this.

139
00:13:01,138 --> 00:13:04,238
Hey, folks!
Welcome to Dixie Doug's.

140
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,839
I've seen you
in here before, right?

141
00:13:05,841 --> 00:13:07,141
Yes.

142
00:13:07,143 --> 00:13:08,709
I've been here a couple
of times, as a matter of fact.

143
00:13:08,711 --> 00:13:10,044
Partial to key lime pie?

144
00:13:10,046 --> 00:13:13,881
I am, I am.
Two to go.

145
00:13:13,883 --> 00:13:16,049
Just go with it,
please. Please.

146
00:13:16,051 --> 00:13:19,521
Uh, I, uh, it's a craving
that I indulge in.

147
00:13:19,523 --> 00:13:22,457
Can't possibly be good for me,
but nothing I like is.

148
00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:25,159
No, no, it's a mighty
fine pie, key lime.

149
00:13:25,161 --> 00:13:26,294
You wouldn't happen to be

150
00:13:26,296 --> 00:13:27,895
the famous "Dixie Doug"
himself, would you?

151
00:13:27,897 --> 00:13:29,064
Oh, heck no.

152
00:13:29,066 --> 00:13:30,497
The pies are trucked
throughout the country.

153
00:13:30,499 --> 00:13:33,101
- They call it "franchising," see?
- Oh.

154
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:35,035
They give us the spinners,
the signage.

155
00:13:35,037 --> 00:13:36,972
That there's "Pie Boy,"
our mascot.

156
00:13:36,974 --> 00:13:38,104
I don't talk like that.

157
00:13:38,106 --> 00:13:40,442
I'm from Ottawa.

158
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:41,445
No.

159
00:13:42,244 --> 00:13:44,380
I completely bought it.

160
00:13:46,316 --> 00:13:47,750
"That's-a-great-a-pie."

161
00:13:50,186 --> 00:13:52,319
The... The, uh...

162
00:13:52,321 --> 00:13:55,191
The little... little guy,
is he supposed to be Italian?

163
00:13:55,892 --> 00:13:57,324
I guess so.

164
00:13:57,326 --> 00:13:59,162
Well, it's very clever.

165
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:04,501
Y'all come back now, you hear?

166
00:14:06,802 --> 00:14:08,504
"Y'all come back now."

167
00:14:10,306 --> 00:14:13,141
Do you think he meant it?

168
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:15,778
He had noticed me.
I mean, you... you heard that.

169
00:14:18,614 --> 00:14:21,616
This pie is rather sordid.

170
00:14:21,618 --> 00:14:23,184
But don't spit it out.

171
00:14:23,186 --> 00:14:24,319
Next time we go,

172
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:26,154
we'll just try
a different flavor. Hmm?

173
00:14:28,925 --> 00:14:31,525
Save it for later,
put it away.

176
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:39,601

177

179
00:14:43,038 --> 00:14:44,973
Oh, dear God!
Change that awfulness.

180
00:14:44,975 --> 00:14:46,844
I do not wanna see that.

181
00:14:48,177 --> 00:14:49,580
I do not wanna see it.

00:14:55,051 --> 00:14:57,017
Oh, look at Betty.

185
00:14:57,019 --> 00:14:59,020
Oh, God, to be young
and beautiful.

186
00:14:59,022 --> 00:15:02,457
If I could go back
to when I was 18...

187
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:03,891
I didn't know anything
about anything,

188
00:15:03,893 --> 00:15:05,495
I'd give myself
a bit of advice.

189
00:15:07,229 --> 00:15:09,731
I would say, "Take better
care of your teeth...

190
00:15:09,733 --> 00:15:11,598
and fuck a lot more."

191
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,501
Oh no, no, that's very good advice.

195
00:16:08,957 --> 00:16:10,391
Look.

196
00:16:10,393 --> 00:16:11,892
Some of the best
minds in the country

197
00:16:11,894 --> 00:16:14,929
peeing all over the floor
in this here facility.

198
00:16:14,931 --> 00:16:16,365
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

199
00:16:17,367 --> 00:16:20,233
There's pee freckles
on the ceiling now.

200
00:16:20,235 --> 00:16:21,938
How'd they get it up there?

201
00:16:23,306 --> 00:16:26,475
Just how big a target
do they need, you figure?

202
00:16:28,244 --> 00:16:30,614
They get enough practice,
that's for sure.

203
00:16:32,349 --> 00:16:34,115
My Brewster...

204
00:16:34,117 --> 00:16:36,317
no one's ever called him
a great mind,

205
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:40,722
but even he manages
to hit the can

206
00:16:40,724 --> 00:16:41,959
70% of the time.

207
00:16:46,128 --> 00:16:47,395
Excuse us, sir.

208
00:16:47,397 --> 00:16:49,497
No, no, no,
that's all right.

209
00:16:49,499 --> 00:16:50,667
Go ahead.

210
00:16:52,534 --> 00:16:55,969
You ladies seem to be
chatting enjoyably.

211
00:16:55,971 --> 00:16:57,673
Girl talk, no doubt.

212
00:16:58,742 --> 00:17:00,277
Don't mind me.

213
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:09,785
Elisa.

214
00:17:12,554 --> 00:17:14,021
Look, don't touch.

215
00:17:14,023 --> 00:17:15,388
That lovely dingus
right there

216
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:16,924
is an Alabama Howdy-do.

217
00:17:16,926 --> 00:17:18,425
Molded grip handle...

218
00:17:18,427 --> 00:17:21,328
low current, high-voltage,
electric shock cattle prod.

219
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:23,865
Name's Strickland, Security.

220
00:17:23,867 --> 00:17:24,965
Fleming's security.

221
00:17:33,775 --> 00:17:34,908
Oh, no.

222
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:36,577
No, a man washes his hands

223
00:17:36,579 --> 00:17:39,646
before or after
tending to his needs.

224
00:17:39,648 --> 00:17:41,917
It tells you a lot
about a man.

225
00:17:42,985 --> 00:17:45,453
He does it both times...

226
00:17:45,455 --> 00:17:47,724
points to a weakness
in character.

227
00:17:51,159 --> 00:17:52,361
Ladies.

228
00:17:55,197 --> 00:17:57,900
It was very pleasant
chatting with you both.

229
00:18:19,388 --> 00:18:21,621
<i>Short people are mean.</i>

230
00:18:21,623 --> 00:18:23,058
I never met a short man

231
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,992
that stayed nice
all the way through.

232
00:18:24,994 --> 00:18:26,360
No, sir.

233
00:18:26,362 --> 00:18:28,731
Mean little backstabbers,
all of them.

234
00:18:29,532 --> 00:18:31,598
Maybe it's the air down there,

235
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,402
not enough oxygen
or something.

236
00:19:01,398 --> 00:19:03,129
Help! He's losing blood!

237
00:19:03,131 --> 00:19:04,197
Help!

238
00:19:04,199 --> 00:19:05,500
Come on, come on.

239
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,473
You think
the Russians broke in?

240
00:19:12,475 --> 00:19:13,907
I don't think so.

241
00:19:13,909 --> 00:19:15,076
And if they did...

242
00:19:15,078 --> 00:19:17,678
Duane's meatloaf
will kill them all, honey.

243
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,313
It was two shots.
Did you hear them?

244
00:19:20,315 --> 00:19:22,649
All right, three.
And that scream.

245
00:19:22,651 --> 00:19:24,452
Lord, what ever happens
in this place?

246
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:26,523
You two, come with me.

247
00:19:27,256 --> 00:19:28,690
Right now, Mr. Fleming, sir?

248
00:19:28,692 --> 00:19:30,691
Any chance we get
to conclude our dinner?

249
00:19:30,693 --> 00:19:32,529
Now!

250
00:19:35,196 --> 00:19:36,664
Oh, heavens to Betsy.

251
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:38,098
We are in a pickle.

252
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,135
We are in such a pickle.

253
00:19:49,346 --> 00:19:51,811
You will have
exactly 20 minutes

254
00:19:51,813 --> 00:19:54,580
to render this... this lab
immaculate, and so on and so forth.

255
00:19:54,582 --> 00:19:56,619
20 minutes.

256
00:19:58,353 --> 00:20:00,790
It's a lot of blood.
What went on in here?

257
00:20:01,957 --> 00:20:03,560
I can handle pee.

258
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,394
I can handle poo.

259
00:20:06,396 --> 00:20:08,495
But blood... Ugh.

260
00:20:08,497 --> 00:20:11,365
Blood just does
something to me.

261
00:20:11,367 --> 00:20:13,834
Here, hon. Help me mop it up.

262
00:20:13,836 --> 00:20:16,039
The sooner we get outta here
the better.

263
00:20:29,952 --> 00:20:31,788
Is that a tater tot?

264
00:20:33,188 --> 00:20:34,457
Oh!

265
00:20:35,023 --> 00:20:36,626
It's a finger.

266
00:20:37,961 --> 00:20:39,460
There's two fingers.

267
00:20:39,462 --> 00:20:40,627
Okay, okay.

268
00:20:40,629 --> 00:20:42,530
Put them away.
And just wait here.

269
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:44,600
I'm gonna go get Mr. Fleming.

270
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:20,268
Where are these body parts?

271
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,538
The body parts?

272
00:21:27,709 --> 00:21:29,576
No, I believe you, honey.

273
00:21:29,578 --> 00:21:31,781
But are you sure it was alive?

274
00:21:32,814 --> 00:21:35,049
Because I saw a mermaid once
in a carnival tent...

275
00:21:35,051 --> 00:21:38,284
and it was a monkey
sewn to the tail of a fish.

276
00:21:38,286 --> 00:21:39,288
Looked real to me.

277
00:21:40,321 --> 00:21:42,155
All right, I apologize.

278
00:21:42,157 --> 00:21:43,859
Oh! I have a deadline.

279
00:21:44,526 --> 00:21:46,092
Do you know,

280
00:21:46,094 --> 00:21:49,064
corn flakes were invented
to prevent masturbation.

281
00:21:50,233 --> 00:21:51,301
Didn't work.

282
00:21:53,369 --> 00:21:55,770
Oh, Alice Faye just started.

283
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,806
She was a huge star, huge.

284
00:21:58,808 --> 00:22:00,674
And one day, she couldn't
take the bullshit

285
00:22:00,676 --> 00:22:01,878
and the backstabbing anymore.

286
00:22:02,978 --> 00:22:05,146
She just walked away
from it all.

287
00:22:05,148 --> 00:22:06,246
Ta-da!

288
00:22:06,248 --> 00:22:07,315
That's not bad, is it?

289
00:22:07,317 --> 00:22:08,752
For being shit.

290
00:22:10,086 --> 00:22:14,120
Listen. You eat,
you go to bed, you rest.

291
00:22:14,122 --> 00:22:17,157

No, we don't get pie.

Green. They want the gelatin
to be green now.

303
00:23:01,469 --> 00:23:03,637
- I was told red.
- New concept.

304
00:23:03,639 --> 00:23:06,005
That's the future now.
Green.

305
00:23:06,007 --> 00:23:09,309
Oh, and they want them
happier, the family.

306
00:23:09,311 --> 00:23:11,212
- Happier? Happier?
- Mmm.

307
00:23:11,214 --> 00:23:12,078
The father looks like

308
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,379
he just discovered
the missionary position.

309
00:23:13,381 --> 00:23:14,514
Giles.

310
00:23:14,516 --> 00:23:17,283
Well, what are they supposed
to be happy about?

311
00:23:17,285 --> 00:23:20,120
The client wanted photographs,
I sold them on this.

312
00:23:20,122 --> 00:23:22,155
It's too bad.
This is nice work.

313
00:23:22,157 --> 00:23:25,061
It is nice, isn't it?
I think it's one of my best.

314
00:23:26,929 --> 00:23:29,328
How are you holding up?
You drinking?

315
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:31,831
No, not a drop. No.

316
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:35,101
Are you getting any work since
you left Klein and Saunders?

317
00:23:35,103 --> 00:23:37,605
You mean since I was asked
to leave by you.

318
00:23:37,607 --> 00:23:40,307
We are not
getting into this now.

319
00:23:40,309 --> 00:23:41,911
I wanna come back, Bernie.

320
00:23:43,611 --> 00:23:46,682
We'll see.
Now, do this.

321
00:23:48,751 --> 00:23:50,617
I think we're making
great progress.

322
00:23:50,619 --> 00:23:51,855
Good work.

323
00:26:11,628 --> 00:26:12,829
Elisa.

324
00:26:14,397 --> 00:26:15,564
What are you doing in there?

325
00:26:17,734 --> 00:26:19,269
Cleaning, huh?

326
00:26:20,302 --> 00:26:21,668
Listen, honey.

327
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:24,437
Mr. "I pee with my hands
on my hips"

328
00:26:24,439 --> 00:26:26,007
wants to see us both.

329
00:26:26,009 --> 00:26:27,808
<i>"Zelda D. Fuller."</i>

330
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:30,711
How long have you two
known each other, Zelda?

331
00:26:30,713 --> 00:26:32,581
About 10 years, sir.

332
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,215
No siblings, Zelda?

333
00:26:36,217 --> 00:26:37,216
No, sir.

334
00:26:37,218 --> 00:26:39,888
That's not common, is it?
For your people?

335
00:26:40,822 --> 00:26:43,025
My mama died after me.

336
00:26:43,892 --> 00:26:45,427
After I was born.

337
00:26:47,996 --> 00:26:49,465
What does that "D" stand for?

338
00:26:50,899 --> 00:26:53,567
Delilah, sir.

339
00:26:53,569 --> 00:26:54,902
On account of the Bible.

340
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:57,203
Delilah, she betrayed Samson.

341
00:26:57,205 --> 00:27:01,008
Lulled him to sleep,
cut his hair.

342
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:03,976
Philistines tortured him,
humiliated him...

343
00:27:03,978 --> 00:27:05,914
burned his eyes out.

344
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:09,950
Guess my mama didn't read
the good book close enough.

345
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:11,154
And you...

346
00:27:12,621 --> 00:27:15,088
"Elisa Esposito."

347
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:17,258
Doesn't "Esposito"
mean orphan?

348
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,992
"Our Lady of Sorrows
Orphanage in Putnam."

349
00:27:19,994 --> 00:27:22,363
They found her by the river

350
00:27:22,365 --> 00:27:23,900
in the water.

351
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:27,904
It was you
that found my fingers.

352
00:27:29,738 --> 00:27:31,137
Oh!

353
00:27:31,139 --> 00:27:32,539
Thanks.

354
00:27:32,541 --> 00:27:34,140
Three hours in surgery.

355
00:27:34,142 --> 00:27:37,444
They rebuilt
the first phalanx here...

356
00:27:37,446 --> 00:27:38,846
sutured the tendons.

357
00:27:38,848 --> 00:27:40,617
Don't know if
it's gonna take or not.

358
00:27:41,684 --> 00:27:44,751
There was mustard on them.
A paper bag?

359
00:27:44,753 --> 00:27:46,386
It was all we had, sir.

360
00:27:46,388 --> 00:27:49,456
I answer mostly on account
that she can't talk.

361
00:27:49,458 --> 00:27:51,393
She can't? She deaf?

362
00:27:52,494 --> 00:27:53,963
Mute, sir.

363
00:27:54,629 --> 00:27:56,265
She said she can hear you.

364
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:04,137
All those scars on your neck.

365
00:28:04,139 --> 00:28:06,609
That's what did it.
Cut your voice box, right?

366
00:28:07,676 --> 00:28:09,777
She said since she was a baby.

367
00:28:09,779 --> 00:28:12,111
Who would do that to a baby?

368
00:28:12,113 --> 00:28:14,313
The world is sinful.

369
00:28:14,315 --> 00:28:16,116
Wouldn't you say so, Delilah?

370
00:28:16,118 --> 00:28:18,087
Well, let me say this upfront.

371
00:28:19,589 --> 00:28:22,155
You clean that lab,
you get out.

372
00:28:22,157 --> 00:28:25,158
The thing we keep in there
is an affront.

373
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,761
Do you know what
an affront is, Zelda?

374
00:28:27,763 --> 00:28:29,430
Something offensive.

375
00:28:29,432 --> 00:28:31,164
That's right,
and I should know.

376
00:28:31,166 --> 00:28:35,001
I dragged that filthy thing...

377
00:28:35,003 --> 00:28:37,538
out of the river muck
in South America

378
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,042
all the way here.

379
00:28:39,975 --> 00:28:41,040
And along the way,

380
00:28:41,042 --> 00:28:43,042
we didn't get
to like each other much.

381
00:28:45,548 --> 00:28:46,646
Now...

382
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:51,087
you may think that thing
looks human.

383
00:28:51,821 --> 00:28:54,020
Stands on two legs, right?

384
00:28:54,022 --> 00:28:57,159
But we're created
in the Lord's image.

385
00:28:58,494 --> 00:29:00,560
You don't think that's what
the Lord looks like, do you?

386
00:29:00,562 --> 00:29:04,098
I wouldn't know, sir,
what the Lord looks like.

387
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:07,035
Well, it's human, Zelda.
He looks like a human, like me.

388
00:29:07,969 --> 00:29:10,136
Or even you.

389
00:29:10,138 --> 00:29:12,341
Maybe a little more like me,
I guess.

390
00:29:15,677 --> 00:29:17,045
That's all.

391
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:22,249
General Hoyt, thank you
for calling me back, sir.

392
00:29:22,251 --> 00:29:24,518
<i>- Feeling better?
- Oh, yes, sir, much better.</i>

393
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,752
Pain pills is all.

394
00:29:25,754 --> 00:29:27,221
<i>- Close the door.
- You lost two fingers, was it?</i>

395
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:29,289
Two fingers, yeah.
He got two fingers.

396
00:29:29,291 --> 00:29:30,724
But I still got my thumb,

397
00:29:30,726 --> 00:29:31,992
my trigger,
and my pussy finger.

398
00:29:31,994 --> 00:29:33,827
<i>Sounds to me
like you'll do all right then.</i>

399
00:29:33,829 --> 00:29:36,029
Yes, sir, that's right.

400
00:29:36,031 --> 00:29:38,030
Looking forward
to your visit, sir.

401
00:29:38,032 --> 00:29:40,634
Decisions need to be made
about the asset.

402

<i>Flavors

<i>The future is here.</i>

405
00:30:23,478 --> 00:30:24,677
Get some rest.

406
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:25,811
<i>Pumpkin, banana...</i>

407
00:30:25,813 --> 00:30:27,780
Pick me up at 9:30.

408
00:30:27,782 --> 00:30:29,718
2130 hours. Yes, sir.

409
00:30:30,352 --> 00:30:33,619
<i>That's-a-great-a-pie.</i>

410
00:30:33,621 --> 00:30:34,754
I'm home.

411
00:30:36,123 --> 00:30:37,490
I made you an omelet.

412
00:30:37,492 --> 00:30:39,526
- Hey, Dad. Guess what?
- No pancakes?

413
00:30:39,528 --> 00:30:41,228
I've been through half the boxes
and I can't find the griddles.

414
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:43,463
- Guess what?
- I made you a cheese and broccoli omelet.

415
00:30:43,465 --> 00:30:44,530
How are you feeling?
Does it hurt?

416
00:30:44,532 --> 00:30:47,000
- A little bit. Pills help.
- Guess what?

417
00:30:47,002 --> 00:30:48,268
What?

418
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:51,038
We're burying a time capsule
at the new school.

419
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,606
I wanted to ask you...

420
00:30:52,608 --> 00:30:55,975
Do you think we'll all have
jetpacks in the future?

421
00:30:55,977 --> 00:30:57,444
Believe it, son.

422
00:30:57,446 --> 00:30:58,580
Oh! Bus is here.

423
00:31:00,148 --> 00:31:01,684
This is America.

424
00:31:03,019 --> 00:31:04,420
Bye, Dad!

425
00:31:08,523 --> 00:31:09,455
Finish your omelet,

426
00:31:09,457 --> 00:31:10,890
then wash your hands
real good...

427
00:31:10,892 --> 00:31:12,559
and come upstairs, sweetie.

428
00:31:12,561 --> 00:31:15,595
I kind of like it here.
The kids like the lawn.

429
00:31:15,597 --> 00:31:18,334
Plus DC is just half
an hour away, isn't it?

430
00:31:19,834 --> 00:31:23,338
It's still Baltimore, Elaine.
No one likes Baltimore.

431
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,743
You know what I'm thinking?

432
00:31:29,145 --> 00:31:32,514
I'm thinking I need a new car.

433
00:31:39,288 --> 00:31:41,124
You need a new car, do you?

434
00:31:42,823 --> 00:31:45,327
How about a Cadillac, mister?

435
00:31:45,793 --> 00:31:47,094
Richard.

436
00:31:49,732 --> 00:31:51,130
Oh, Richard!

Sweetie, Sweetie?

438
00:31:55,436 --> 00:31:57,771
Sweetie, your, um,
your hand is bleeding.

439
00:31:57,773 --> 00:31:59,005
Silence. Don't talk.

440
00:31:59,007 --> 00:32:00,874
Don't talk.
I want you in silence.

441
00:32:00,876 --> 00:32:03,143

00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:50,710
Fetch the general, will you?

484
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,295
Aww, you missed me, huh?

485
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:10,232
I took a candy break.

486
00:40:14,569 --> 00:40:16,536
This is what scares you, huh?

487
00:40:16,538 --> 00:40:18,003
Well, gee, you should
be used to it by now.

488
00:40:20,909 --> 00:40:24,009
There you go again,
making that god-awful sound.

489
00:40:24,011 --> 00:40:27,014
Is that you crying, huh?
Is that what it is?

490
00:40:27,016 --> 00:40:28,117
Are you hurting?

491
00:40:29,284 --> 00:40:31,983
Or maybe you're angry!

492
00:40:31,985 --> 00:40:34,223
Maybe you'd like to get
another bite of me.

493
00:40:34,554 --> 00:40:36,054
Go ahead.

494
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,728
I can't tell.

495
00:40:42,364 --> 00:40:44,096
I mean, are you begging?

496
00:40:44,098 --> 00:40:45,364
Because to me,

497
00:40:45,366 --> 00:40:48,433
it's just the worst fucking
noise I ever heard.

498
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:17,096
<i>Paging Captain Walters.</i>

499
00:41:17,098 --> 00:41:20,233
<i>Captain Walters, please
pick up the courtesy call.</i>

500
00:41:20,235 --> 00:41:21,303
Elisa.

501
00:41:22,203 --> 00:41:23,237
Elisa!

502
00:41:34,482 --> 00:41:36,815
General Hoyt!
Welcome, sir!

503
00:41:36,817 --> 00:41:38,784
Everything's ready.
Glad to have you, sir.

504
00:41:38,786 --> 00:41:40,619
- Good to see you, son.
- Thank you.

505
00:41:40,621 --> 00:41:43,154
Good God Almighty!
Is that it?

506
00:41:43,156 --> 00:41:44,757
Hell of a lot bigger
than I thought.

507
00:41:44,759 --> 00:41:46,291
Ugly as sin.

508
00:41:46,293 --> 00:41:49,862
You know, the natives in the
Amazon worshipped it like a god.

509
00:41:49,864 --> 00:41:52,931
Doesn't look like
much of a god now, does it?

510
00:41:52,933 --> 00:41:54,400
Well, they're primitive, sir.

511
00:41:54,402 --> 00:41:56,402
You know, they would toss
offerings into the water.

512
00:41:56,404 --> 00:41:58,337
Flowers, fruits,
crap like that.

513
00:41:58,339 --> 00:42:00,306
Then they tried
to stop the oil drill

514
00:42:00,308 --> 00:42:01,608
with bows and arrows.

515
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:02,976
That didn't turn out too well.

516
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:04,913
He's bleeding.

517
00:42:06,114 --> 00:42:07,246
What happened?

518
00:42:07,248 --> 00:42:09,248
It's an animal, Hoffstetler.
Just keeping it tame.

519
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:12,918
"Oxygen osmosis
and dioxide exchange."

520
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,487
What the hell
have we got here, son?

521
00:42:14,489 --> 00:42:15,621
This creature, sir...

522
00:42:15,623 --> 00:42:17,056
it can alternate between two

523
00:42:17,058 --> 00:42:18,958
entirely separate
breathing mechanisms.

524
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,293
- A mudskipper can do that.
- No.

525
00:42:21,295 --> 00:42:22,895
Look.

526
00:42:22,897 --> 00:42:24,764
You want to put
a man in space.

527
00:42:24,766 --> 00:42:26,333
He's gonna have
to endure conditions

528
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:28,768
the human body
just wasn't made for.

529
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:31,605
This gives us an edge
against the Soviets.

530
00:42:31,607 --> 00:42:33,639
How long can it breathe
outside the water?

531
00:42:33,641 --> 00:42:34,808
The reality is, sir,

532
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:36,512
we don't know jack shit
about this thing.

533
00:42:38,913 --> 00:42:41,780
Well, the Soviets want it.
We know that much.

534
00:42:41,782 --> 00:42:43,382
Those cockeyed bastards.

535
00:42:43,384 --> 00:42:46,319
You know, we let 'em send
a dog up into space,

536
00:42:46,321 --> 00:42:47,387
and we get a good laugh.

537
00:42:47,389 --> 00:42:49,688
Then the next thing you know,
they send a human up,

538
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:50,824
a Russki,

539
00:42:50,826 --> 00:42:53,259
orbiting the planet,
doing God knows what.

540
00:42:53,261 --> 00:42:56,295
Who's laughing then?
Khrushchev, that's who.

541
00:42:56,297 --> 00:42:59,165
Let him send a dog up into space, 
and he laughs.

542
00:42:59,167 --> 00:43:01,634
Then he puts a commie
up in space, and he laughs.

543
00:43:01,636 --> 00:43:04,005
And then he puts
missiles into Cuba.

544
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:05,971
Have we learned nothing?

545
00:43:05,973 --> 00:43:07,907
Sir, we need to
get him back in the water.

546
00:43:07,909 --> 00:43:10,076
See, these scientists,
they're like artists, sir.

547
00:43:10,078 --> 00:43:11,744
They fall in love
with their plaything.

548
00:43:11,746 --> 00:43:13,279
Now, right here, see?

549
00:43:13,281 --> 00:43:14,514
Along the middle.

550
00:43:14,516 --> 00:43:16,916
This creature has
a thick-jointed cartilage

551
00:43:16,918 --> 00:43:19,552
that separates the primary
and secondary lungs.

552
00:43:19,554 --> 00:43:20,753
Am I explaining
this correctly, Bob?

553
00:43:20,755 --> 00:43:21,853
Yes, but we have...

554
00:43:21,855 --> 00:43:24,657
It makes the X-rays
inconclusive.

555
00:43:24,659 --> 00:43:25,991
In principle, sir, yes. But...

556
00:43:25,993 --> 00:43:27,927
Now, I believe if we want to
get an edge on the Soviets

557
00:43:27,929 --> 00:43:29,996
we need to vivisect
this thing.

558
00:43:29,998 --> 00:43:30,962
- No, no.
- Take it apart,

559
00:43:30,964 --> 00:43:32,065
- learn how it works.
- No.

560
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:34,069
No! That would
defeat the purpose.

561
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:37,272
Sir, he's passed out.
Please.

562
00:43:37,938 --> 00:43:39,338
Put him in the tank.

563
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:40,509
Let him pressurize.

564
00:43:41,375 --> 00:43:42,844
General Hoyt, sir?

565
00:43:45,013 --> 00:43:46,846
You cannot,
under any circumstance,

566
00:43:46,848 --> 00:43:48,050
kill this creature.

567
00:43:52,654 --> 00:43:55,087
Count these stars
with me, son.

568
00:43:55,089 --> 00:43:56,489
There are five of them.

569
00:43:56,491 --> 00:43:58,824
Means I can do
whatever the hell I want.

570
00:43:58,826 --> 00:44:00,092
Now, you want
to plead your case,

571
00:44:00,094 --> 00:44:01,360
I'll listen to it.

572
00:44:01,362 --> 00:44:04,998
But at the end of the day,
it is my damn decision.

573
00:44:50,277 --> 00:44:53,112
So crack the damn thing open,
learn what you can,

574
00:44:53,114 --> 00:44:55,148
and close up shop here.

575
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:57,550
Give yourself a good
pat on the back, Strickland.

576
00:44:57,552 --> 00:44:58,684
You've done it.

577
00:44:58,686 --> 00:44:59,819
Thank you, sir.

578
00:44:59,821 --> 00:45:01,954
Now, hurry up
and finish the job, son.

579
00:45:01,956 --> 00:45:03,558
Absolutely, sir.

580
00:45:05,192 --> 00:45:06,659
<i>Get him out?</i>

581
00:45:06,661 --> 00:45:08,594
What are you talking about?

582
00:45:08,596 --> 00:45:10,598
No. Absolutely not.

583
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:13,766
Because it's breaking the law,
that's why.

584
00:45:13,768 --> 00:45:16,038
We're probably breaking
the law just talking about it.

585
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:19,674
Oh, he's alone? Oh.

586
00:45:20,542 --> 00:45:21,974
Does this mean that whenever

587
00:45:21,976 --> 00:45:23,275
we go to
a Chinese restaurant

588
00:45:23,277 --> 00:45:26,378
you wanna save
every fish in the tank?

589
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:29,350
So what if he's alone?
We're all alone.

590
00:45:31,819 --> 00:45:33,085
The loneliest thing
you've ever seen?

591
00:45:33,087 --> 00:45:34,987
Well, you just said it right there.
You just said it!

592
00:45:34,989 --> 00:45:36,991
You called it a thing.
It's a thing. It's a freak.

593
00:45:38,793 --> 00:45:39,962
I can understand you.

594
00:45:43,697 --> 00:45:45,634
Calm down. God, calm down.

595
00:45:46,668 --> 00:45:48,236
All right,
I will repeat it to you.

596
00:45:53,907 --> 00:45:55,344
"What am I?

597
00:46:00,047 --> 00:46:03,084
"I move my mouth, like him.

598
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:07,487
"I make no sound, like him.

599
00:46:09,958 --> 00:46:11,760
"What does that make me?

600
00:46:14,194 --> 00:46:16,261
"All that I am...

601
00:46:16,263 --> 00:46:18,730
"all that I've ever been...

602
00:46:18,732 --> 00:46:21,467
"brought me here, to him."

603
00:46:21,469 --> 00:46:24,505
See, you're saying "him."
It's a "him" now.

604
00:46:25,607 --> 00:46:27,540
You just hit me!

605
00:46:27,542 --> 00:46:29,007
Elisa, let go of me.

606
00:46:29,009 --> 00:46:30,242
I'm looking. I'm looking!

607
00:46:30,244 --> 00:46:32,445
You've never hit me.

608
00:46:37,719 --> 00:46:41,289
"When he looks at me,
the way he looks at me...

609
00:46:42,156 --> 00:46:46,193
"He does not know
what I lack...

610
00:46:47,362 --> 00:46:49,164
"or how...

611
00:46:50,531 --> 00:46:52,067
"I am incomplete.

612
00:46:54,002 --> 00:46:56,569
"He sees me...

613
00:46:56,571 --> 00:46:59,105
"for what I am...

614
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:00,609
"as I am.

615
00:47:04,145 --> 00:47:05,347
"He's happy...

616
00:47:06,181 --> 00:47:09,284
"to see me, every time...

617
00:47:10,016 --> 00:47:11,419
"every day.

618
00:47:12,886 --> 00:47:16,323
"And now I can either...

619
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:18,527
"save him...

620
00:47:24,065 --> 00:47:25,300
or let him die."

621
00:47:27,134 --> 00:47:30,136
Oh, God. I'm leaving.

622
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:33,105
Elisa, no. I have to leave.

623
00:47:33,107 --> 00:47:34,507
Just... Elisa, please stop.

624
00:47:34,509 --> 00:47:36,141
Listen to me.
Just listen to me.

625
00:47:36,143 --> 00:47:38,009
I have to go.

626
00:47:38,011 --> 00:47:40,179
I'm leaving now
because, Elisa,

627
00:47:40,181 --> 00:47:41,313
this is very important to me.

628
00:47:41,315 --> 00:47:42,915
This is a second
chance for me.

629
00:47:42,917 --> 00:47:45,083
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

630
00:47:45,085 --> 00:47:46,652
Oh, God.

631
00:47:46,654 --> 00:47:47,920
When I come back,
we just will not talk

632
00:47:47,922 --> 00:47:49,554
about this ever again.

633
00:47:49,556 --> 00:47:51,090
Elisa, there's...

634
00:47:51,092 --> 00:47:52,157
All right!

635
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:55,594
What are we?
What are you and I?

636
00:47:55,596 --> 00:47:57,663
Do you know what we are?
We're nothing!

637
00:47:57,665 --> 00:47:59,498
Nothing! We can do nothing!

638
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:03,335
I'm sorry, but this...
this is just...

639
00:48:03,337 --> 00:48:05,506
Oh, God, it's not
even human. God!

640
00:48:10,478 --> 00:48:11,780
What?

641
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:29,631
Giles.

642
00:48:35,036 --> 00:48:36,703
- I've been waiting.
- I know. Sorry.

643
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:37,706
It's okay.

644
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:40,142
We going in?

645
00:48:41,009 --> 00:48:42,808
You should have
just mailed the art.

646
00:48:42,810 --> 00:48:43,775
No.

647
00:48:43,777 --> 00:48:46,645
I want to show it to you
and the team in person.

648
00:48:46,647 --> 00:48:48,614
I think it's some
of my best work.

649
00:48:48,616 --> 00:48:51,384
And it's green as can be.

650
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:55,422
It's, uh, it's not a good time.
Maybe later.

651
00:48:57,891 --> 00:48:59,657
Oh. Well, sure.

652
00:48:59,659 --> 00:49:00,828
No problem.

653
00:49:02,763 --> 00:49:05,667
What would be a good time
for you, Bernie?

654
00:49:13,373 --> 00:49:15,375
You painted that?

655
00:49:15,377 --> 00:49:16,675
Yeah.

656
00:49:16,677 --> 00:49:18,476
Wowee!

657
00:49:18,478 --> 00:49:19,744
You're good.

658
00:49:19,746 --> 00:49:22,213
Apparently, not as good
as a photograph.

659
00:49:23,518 --> 00:49:25,784
But it is good, isn't it?

660
00:49:25,786 --> 00:49:27,786
I couldn't paint
anything like that.

661
00:49:27,788 --> 00:49:30,121
Here. On me.

662
00:49:30,123 --> 00:49:31,290
For me?

663
00:49:31,292 --> 00:49:32,791
Well, we don't get
many like you in here.

664
00:49:32,793 --> 00:49:35,931
You seem very educated,
and I like talking to you.

665
00:49:36,998 --> 00:49:40,333
The thing is that's...

666
00:49:40,335 --> 00:49:42,802
the only reason
that I come in here is...

667
00:49:42,804 --> 00:49:44,670
- The conversation.
- And?

668
00:49:44,672 --> 00:49:46,771
The pie is mighty fine,
too, isn't it?

669
00:49:46,773 --> 00:49:47,775
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

670
00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:51,346
It's no key lime,
but it's good.

671
00:49:55,081 --> 00:49:57,382
You know, I work alone...

672
00:49:57,384 --> 00:50:01,820
and my best friend's not much
of a conversationalist.

673
00:50:01,822 --> 00:50:03,521
You see, that's part
of doing the job here.

674
00:50:03,523 --> 00:50:05,623
It's like being a bartender.

675
00:50:05,625 --> 00:50:07,726
You serve people pie.
You listen to their problems.

676
00:50:07,728 --> 00:50:09,297
You get to know them.

677
00:50:11,498 --> 00:50:13,766
I'd like to get
to know you better.

678
00:50:13,768 --> 00:50:15,333
What the hell
are you doing, old man?

679
00:50:15,335 --> 00:50:17,603
- Let's sit down.
- Oh. Oh, oh, oh.

680
00:50:17,605 --> 00:50:18,469
Hey, no, no, no.

681
00:50:18,471 --> 00:50:20,005
Not the counter.
Takeout only.

682
00:50:20,007 --> 00:50:21,273
You can't sit there.

683
00:50:21,275 --> 00:50:22,875
If you want something,
you order, you take it out.

684
00:50:22,877 --> 00:50:25,311
But it's empty.
The... the counter's empty.

685
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:27,916
All reserved, all day.
You don't sit down.

686
00:50:30,752 --> 00:50:33,288
Y'all come back now, you hear?

687
00:50:34,288 --> 00:50:35,824
You don't need
to talk to them like that.

688
00:50:37,257 --> 00:50:39,491
You should go, too.

689
00:50:39,493 --> 00:50:42,429
And don't come back.
This is a family restaurant.

690
00:50:52,973 --> 00:50:55,474
<i>♪ So come back to my arms ♪</i>

691
00:50:56,911 --> 00:51:00,849
<i>♪ And show me
how wrong I can be ♪</i>

692
00:51:01,782 --> 00:51:03,949
I have no one.

693
00:51:03,951 --> 00:51:06,487
And you are the only person
that I can talk to.

694
00:51:07,288 --> 00:51:10,558
Now, whatever this thing is...

695
00:51:11,259 --> 00:51:12,793
you need it.

696
00:51:13,828 --> 00:51:15,927
So...

697
00:51:15,929 --> 00:51:17,963
you just tell me
what to do.

698
00:51:23,170 --> 00:51:27,172
<i>♪ So come back to my arms ♪</i>

699
00:51:27,174 --> 00:51:30,007
<i>♪ And show me ♪</i>

700
00:51:30,009 --> 00:51:36,447
<i>♪ How wrong I can be ♪</i>

701
00:51:36,449 --> 00:51:39,619
- "All hope fades."
- "As the spring recedes."

702
00:51:39,621 --> 00:51:40,655
Let's go.

703
00:53:20,487 --> 00:53:23,889
<i>♪ There's a summer place ♪</i>

704
00:53:27,194 --> 00:53:31,596
<i>♪ Where it may rain or storm ♪</i>

705
00:53:31,598 --> 00:53:35,836
<i>♪ Yet I'm safe and warm ♪</i>

706
00:53:37,772 --> 00:53:40,605
Cadillac DeVille.
Best car ever made.

707
00:53:40,607 --> 00:53:44,643
V8, 390 CID, clean and crisp
like a fresh dollar bill.

708
00:53:44,645 --> 00:53:46,277
I'm just idling around.

709
00:53:46,279 --> 00:53:47,712
And I'm just talking.

710
00:53:47,714 --> 00:53:49,514
AM radio, air conditioner,

711
00:53:49,516 --> 00:53:53,485
power windows, power brakes,
power steering, power seats.

712
00:53:53,487 --> 00:53:55,487
All deluxe interior
appointment choices,

713
00:53:55,489 --> 00:53:57,021
143 options.

714
00:53:57,023 --> 00:53:58,757
Now, this...

715
00:53:58,759 --> 00:54:01,559
- is the Taj Mahal on wheels.
- Hmm.

716
00:54:01,561 --> 00:54:03,161
I'm not sure about the green.

717
00:54:03,163 --> 00:54:04,563
It's not green,
my friend. Teal.

718
00:54:04,565 --> 00:54:06,697
- Well, teal looks green to me.
- But it isn't, see?

719
00:54:06,699 --> 00:54:08,900
It's a limited edition,
12 coats of paint...

720
00:54:08,902 --> 00:54:10,201
polished by hand,

721
00:54:10,203 --> 00:54:12,304
all authentic
chrome detailing.

722
00:54:12,306 --> 00:54:14,206
Four out of five
successful men in America

723
00:54:14,208 --> 00:54:15,373
drive a Cadillac.

724
00:54:15,375 --> 00:54:16,507
That a fact?

725
00:54:16,509 --> 00:54:17,708
This here is the future.

726
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:20,145
And you strike me as a man
who is headed there.

727
00:54:20,147 --> 00:54:21,846
- Where?
- Why, the future.

728
00:54:21,848 --> 00:54:25,052
You're the man of the future.
You belong in this car.

729
00:55:19,741 --> 00:55:20,905
Wow!

730
00:55:20,907 --> 00:55:23,310
Sir, that is a...
that is a beautiful car!

731
00:55:24,645 --> 00:55:25,844
What can I say?

732
00:55:25,846 --> 00:55:27,648
You gotta feel good
driving that, huh?

733
00:55:28,781 --> 00:55:31,215
And what a wonderful
shade of green, huh?

734
00:55:31,217 --> 00:55:32,784
Teal.

735
00:55:32,786 --> 00:55:33,955
Teal.

736
00:55:42,596 --> 00:55:44,996
Tomorrow, I'll make
a mean meatloaf.

737
00:55:44,998 --> 00:55:45,998
Mmm-hmm.

738
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,670
Just for you, extra raisins.

739
00:56:13,927 --> 00:56:15,761
So, at 5:00 AM,
I drive my car

740
00:56:15,763 --> 00:56:16,996
down the loading ramp.

741
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:19,331
And the shifts are changing,
and I have...

742
00:56:19,333 --> 00:56:21,300
How much time do I have?

743
00:56:21,302 --> 00:56:22,900
Five minutes? I'll remember.

744
00:56:22,902 --> 00:56:25,337
5:00 AM, five minutes.
Five-five, five-five.

745
00:56:25,339 --> 00:56:27,840
So, you're going
to move the cameras, right?

746
00:56:27,842 --> 00:56:29,907
And I'm gonna be
synchronizing our watches

747
00:56:29,909 --> 00:56:31,809
just like they do
in the movies.

748
00:56:31,811 --> 00:56:34,480
Oh, God! I'm so proud of you.

749
00:56:34,482 --> 00:56:36,817
God! You're not afraid!

750
00:56:38,152 --> 00:56:40,686
You are? Very?

751
00:56:40,688 --> 00:56:43,489
Don't tell me that.
I'm terrified.

752
00:56:48,529 --> 00:56:50,195
I think this is some
of my best work.

753
00:56:50,197 --> 00:56:52,563
"Michael Parker." I think
it's a good, trustworthy name.

754
00:56:52,565 --> 00:56:53,699
It's a little butch.

755
00:56:53,701 --> 00:56:55,770
Yes, age 51.

756
00:56:57,003 --> 00:56:58,005
54?

757
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:01,743
You don't have to be rude.

758
00:57:03,076 --> 00:57:04,411
57.

759
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:06,545
If I put the hair on,

760
00:57:06,547 --> 00:57:08,146
I can pull it off.
I can wear this...

761
00:57:08,148 --> 00:57:09,114
or I have...

762
00:57:09,116 --> 00:57:11,817
Thor, go. Off, off, off! Go!

763
00:57:11,819 --> 00:57:12,951
Or I have this.

764
00:57:12,953 --> 00:57:15,253
Now this, I think it says
"working man."

765
00:57:15,255 --> 00:57:17,824
But this, now this says...

766
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:20,826
this says with
the butterscotch tie...

767
00:57:20,828 --> 00:57:24,529
This says "casual,
but still stylish."

768
00:57:24,531 --> 00:57:27,532
So, you like this?
I agree, I agree.

769
00:57:27,534 --> 00:57:28,967
I think we're ready.

770
00:57:49,255 --> 00:57:51,590
Mr. Strickland!

771
00:57:51,592 --> 00:57:53,324
Sally, could you call
Miss Esposito

772
00:57:53,326 --> 00:57:55,062
to clean up a spill?

773
00:57:58,532 --> 00:58:01,632
You know,
I can't figure it out myself.

774
00:58:01,634 --> 00:58:03,203
You're not much to look at...

775
00:58:04,371 --> 00:58:05,704
but go figure.

776
00:58:05,706 --> 00:58:07,773
I keep thinking about you.

777
00:58:07,775 --> 00:58:10,775
When you say you're mute,
are you entirely silent...

778
00:58:10,777 --> 00:58:12,846
or do you squawk a little?

779
00:58:14,014 --> 00:58:16,581
Some mutes squawk.
Not pretty, but...

780
00:58:16,583 --> 00:58:17,918
Hmm?

781
00:58:20,487 --> 00:58:22,490
I just want you to know...

782
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:26,190
I don't mind those scars.

783
00:58:26,192 --> 00:58:29,027
I don't mind that
you can't speak, either.

784
00:58:29,029 --> 00:58:31,465
When you come
right down to it...

785
00:58:32,465 --> 00:58:33,935
I like it.

786
00:58:34,935 --> 00:58:36,269
A lot.

787
00:58:37,471 --> 00:58:39,206
It kind of gets me going.

788
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:48,382
I bet I can make you
squawk a little.

789
00:59:21,715 --> 00:59:23,484
Hey, honey. You okay?

790
00:59:24,652 --> 00:59:26,684
Hurry up.
I wanna be home early.

791
00:59:26,686 --> 00:59:28,221
My feet are killing me.

792
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:56,950
We need to delay
the procedure.

793
00:59:57,750 --> 00:59:59,617
Knock before
you enter my office.

794
00:59:59,619 --> 01:00:00,888
This is urgent!

795
01:00:01,656 --> 01:00:03,221
Go back out, knock,

796
01:00:03,223 --> 01:00:04,422
then I'll let you in
and we'll talk.

797
01:00:04,424 --> 01:00:07,093
That's the protocol.
Follow the protocol.

798
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,400
Come in.

799
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:16,237
Would you get the door
for me, please?

800
01:00:21,942 --> 01:00:24,342
See? That's the way.
Now, we talk.

801
01:00:24,344 --> 01:00:25,876
I need more time.

802
01:00:25,878 --> 01:00:27,880
Don't let the fact
that you feel like a loser

803
01:00:27,882 --> 01:00:30,148
now that you've let your
competitive tendencies...

804
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:32,784
I'm not competitive!
I don't want an intricate,

805
01:00:32,786 --> 01:00:34,221
beautiful thing destroyed!

806
01:00:38,558 --> 01:00:40,192
This thing dies...

807
01:00:40,194 --> 01:00:42,962
you learn, I leave,
out of here.

808
01:00:42,964 --> 01:00:44,929
I settle down.

809
01:00:44,931 --> 01:00:47,733
My family settles down
somewhere nice.

810
01:00:47,735 --> 01:00:49,403
<i>A real city.</i>

811
01:00:55,176 --> 01:00:58,009
This creature
is intelligent...

812
01:00:58,011 --> 01:00:59,944
capable of language...

813
01:00:59,946 --> 01:01:02,382
of understanding emotions.

814
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:05,315
So are the Soviets, the Gooks.

815
01:01:05,317 --> 01:01:08,253
And we still kill them,
don't we?

816
01:01:08,255 --> 01:01:10,954
The bottom line is,
this isn't a petting zoo

817
01:01:10,956 --> 01:01:13,391
and I don't wanna be
in this shit hole

818
01:01:13,393 --> 01:01:14,925
any longer than need be.

819
01:01:14,927 --> 01:01:16,429
Do you?

820
01:01:17,331 --> 01:01:20,468
Bob. Do you?

821
01:01:22,335 --> 01:01:23,904
No, I don't.

822
01:01:44,991 --> 01:01:46,994
Hey, what are you waiting for?

823
01:01:47,728 --> 01:01:49,594
Have you seen Elisa?

824
01:01:49,596 --> 01:01:51,264
Come on, Zelda!

825
01:02:04,545 --> 01:02:07,078
Did you move
the camera on the loading dock?

826
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:08,713
Is that where
you're taking him?

827
01:02:08,715 --> 01:02:10,181
Through the service tunnels?

828
01:02:10,183 --> 01:02:12,085
That's very smart.

829
01:02:12,719 --> 01:02:14,652
Who do you work for?

830
01:02:33,373 --> 01:02:36,875
His water must be kept
at 5 to 8% salinity.

831
01:02:36,877 --> 01:02:38,444
Table salt will do.

832
01:02:38,446 --> 01:02:42,415
Mix one of these in his water
every three days.

833
01:02:43,317 --> 01:02:46,451
Raw protein diet is a must.

834
01:02:46,453 --> 01:02:48,119
In five minutes...

835
01:02:48,121 --> 01:02:49,654
<i>I'll meet you
at the loading dock.</i>

836
01:02:49,656 --> 01:02:51,088
<i>The lights will go out...</i>

837
01:02:51,090 --> 01:02:52,659
<i>so be prepared.</i>

838
01:03:12,177 --> 01:03:13,945
Mr. Strickland, sir?

839
01:03:13,947 --> 01:03:16,313
Twelve hours to
the vivisection of the asset.

840
01:03:16,315 --> 01:03:18,718
And I need your signature
here, please.

841
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:24,922
<i>...this
sudden, clandestine decision</i>

842
01:03:24,924 --> 01:03:26,425
<i>to station strategic weapons</i>

843
01:03:26,427 --> 01:03:29,096
<i>for the first time
outside of Soviet soil...</i>

844
01:03:30,130 --> 01:03:32,297
Hold it right there.

845
01:03:32,299 --> 01:03:34,634
<i>...an unjustified change
in the status quo...</i>

846
01:03:53,118 --> 01:03:55,219
"Michael Parker." Is that you?

847
01:03:55,221 --> 01:03:56,690
My whole life.

848
01:04:13,973 --> 01:04:15,475
Are you out of your mind?

849
01:04:17,610 --> 01:04:21,147
Don't do this, Elisa.
Don't do this!

850
01:04:26,319 --> 01:04:28,619
What's that?
What's that vehicle?

851
01:04:28,621 --> 01:04:32,489
Gosh, sir, I'm not sure.
It's a laundry van?

852
01:04:32,491 --> 01:04:34,527
But it's not scheduled.

853
01:04:39,232 --> 01:04:40,665
<i>And finally,</i>

854
01:04:40,667 --> 01:04:42,733
<i>I call upon
Chairman Khrushchev</i>

855
01:04:42,735 --> 01:04:44,371
<i>to halt and eliminate...</i>

856
01:04:45,270 --> 01:04:47,204
<i>this clandestine, reckless,</i>

857
01:04:47,206 --> 01:04:49,440
<i>and provocative threat
to world peace</i>

858
01:04:49,442 --> 01:04:52,279
<i>and to stable relations
between our two nations.</i>

859
01:04:58,384 --> 01:04:59,217
Sir?

860
01:04:59,219 --> 01:05:02,020
- Meet me at the loading dock.
- Sir!

861
01:05:02,022 --> 01:05:03,621
- Sir, what do you need me to do?
- Get backup.

862
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:08,826
Step out of the vehicle, sir.

863
01:05:08,828 --> 01:05:10,395
Oh, God. I'm not good at this.

864
01:05:10,397 --> 01:05:12,530
Out of the vehicle now.
I will not say it again.

865
01:05:12,532 --> 01:05:14,398
- Oh, God. Please don't shoot me!
- Get out!

866
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:15,636
Oh, God.
Don't shoot me. Please.

867
01:05:25,679 --> 01:05:27,848
What are you waiting for?
We're out of time!

868
01:05:29,516 --> 01:05:30,551
Get out now!

869
01:05:32,652 --> 01:05:34,386
You have to go. Hurry!

870
01:05:34,388 --> 01:05:36,887
Oh, woman,
we're gonna burn in hell.

871
01:05:36,889 --> 01:05:38,123
Come on, push.

872
01:05:38,125 --> 01:05:39,527
Push!

873
01:05:41,295 --> 01:05:43,527
I swear, I'm not
doing this on purpose!

874
01:05:43,529 --> 01:05:45,732
Mechanical objects and I
just don't get along!

875
01:05:49,768 --> 01:05:50,768
What the...

876
01:05:50,770 --> 01:05:53,137
She's waiting for you
at the dock. Go! Now!

877
01:06:08,721 --> 01:06:10,454
Who's that man? I think
he just killed someone.

878
01:06:12,859 --> 01:06:14,828
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

879
01:06:29,909 --> 01:06:31,712
Are we ready,
are we ready?

880
01:06:38,118 --> 01:06:39,886
He's so beautiful.

881
01:06:48,596 --> 01:06:49,597
Did I do that?

882
01:06:52,299 --> 01:06:53,634
I'm just not good at this.

883
01:06:54,868 --> 01:06:56,268
Move! Move!

884
01:07:38,645 --> 01:07:40,614
Come on. No.

885
01:07:44,951 --> 01:07:46,419
No!

886
01:08:07,406 --> 01:08:09,809
Salt? What are you
talking about, salt?

887
01:08:12,212 --> 01:08:13,480
Elisa!

888
01:09:04,063 --> 01:09:05,065
There.

889
01:09:22,883 --> 01:09:23,984
Israeli Popper.

890
01:09:26,152 --> 01:09:28,088
You can smell the magnesium.

891
01:09:29,521 --> 01:09:30,854
Russians hate the Jews,

892
01:09:30,856 --> 01:09:33,426
but they can't get enough
of their gadgets.

893
01:09:35,161 --> 01:09:36,527
How'd they get in here?

894
01:09:36,529 --> 01:09:39,463
Forged ID, painted plates,
and so on and so forth.

895
01:09:39,465 --> 01:09:43,134
And they moved the main
video camera on the dock, sir.

896
01:09:43,136 --> 01:09:44,301
Well, no one has to know.

897
01:09:44,303 --> 01:09:46,037
We got 24 hours
before I bounce it up.

898
01:09:46,039 --> 01:09:47,971
No, I called it in.

899
01:09:47,973 --> 01:09:49,107
You called it in?

900
01:09:49,109 --> 01:09:50,643
The moment it happened, I...

901
01:09:51,343 --> 01:09:52,879
Mr. Strickland, sir.

902
01:09:54,414 --> 01:09:55,680
What is it, Sally?

903
01:09:55,682 --> 01:09:58,350
Sir, General Hoyt
is on the phone.

904
01:09:58,352 --> 01:10:01,118
<i>That thing was
our space dog, Strickland.</i>

905
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:02,252
<i>You know that.</i>

906
01:10:02,254 --> 01:10:04,087
Sir, I'm getting it back.

907
01:10:04,089 --> 01:10:08,024
I can't be in a negative
frame of mind, sir.

908
01:10:08,026 --> 01:10:09,394
<i>So, you're feeling good?</i>

909
01:10:09,396 --> 01:10:11,595
Feeling strong.
Getting it back.

910
01:10:11,597 --> 01:10:14,532
<i>You can get it done.
You're gonna get it done.</i>

911
01:10:14,534 --> 01:10:17,004
<i>For me, son. For me.</i>

912
01:10:58,244 --> 01:11:00,944
That's when you're
planning on releasing him?

913
01:11:00,946 --> 01:11:02,548
On the 10th?

914
01:11:03,784 --> 01:11:05,649
So, what if the rains
are late?

915
01:11:05,651 --> 01:11:07,119
What happens with the canal?

916
01:11:08,888 --> 01:11:09,956
All right.

917
01:11:14,026 --> 01:11:15,495
What's that?

918
01:11:16,529 --> 01:11:19,066
Let me see it.
Is that for me?

919
01:11:57,838 --> 01:12:01,642
Yeah, that's good.
Keep that up.

920
01:12:02,676 --> 01:12:05,643
Looking like
you don't know anything.

921
01:12:05,645 --> 01:12:09,279
Lord help me,
if they ask me if I do.

922
01:12:09,281 --> 01:12:10,648
I'm not a good liar.

923
01:12:10,650 --> 01:12:11,949
Except to Brewster.

924
01:12:11,951 --> 01:12:14,618
It takes a lot of lies
to keep a marriage going.

925
01:12:14,620 --> 01:12:16,019
<i>All personnel,</i>

926
01:12:16,021 --> 01:12:18,588
<i>prepare to present your
identity and clearance cards.</i>

927
01:12:18,590 --> 01:12:22,193
Lord! What in the...

928
01:12:22,195 --> 01:12:24,060
<i>Attention. All personnel,</i>

929
01:12:24,062 --> 01:12:27,431
<i>prepare to present your
identity and clearance cards.</i>

930
01:12:27,433 --> 01:12:29,567
You done got us
in a world of trouble.

931
01:12:29,569 --> 01:12:30,801
My opinion,
we're looking

932
01:12:30,803 --> 01:12:32,470
at a highly-trained
group, sir.

933
01:12:32,472 --> 01:12:34,238
I'm thinking,
conceivably, sir,

934
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:36,774
like special forces
or so on and so forth.

935
01:12:36,776 --> 01:12:38,509
Red Army Special Forces?

936
01:12:38,511 --> 01:12:39,710
Conceivably.

937
01:12:39,712 --> 01:12:41,144
And they're highly trained.

938
01:12:41,146 --> 01:12:43,982
They were well-financed,
an elite group.

939
01:12:43,984 --> 01:12:46,951
Highly efficient, ruthless,
clockwork precision.

940
01:12:46,953 --> 01:12:48,885
Infiltration took less
than five minutes, sir.

941
01:12:48,887 --> 01:12:50,755
My conservative estimate
is that this was

942
01:12:50,757 --> 01:12:52,625
a strike force
of at least 10 men.

943
01:13:05,338 --> 01:13:07,206
<i>My master sends this dress.</i>

944
01:13:08,174 --> 01:13:09,976
Have you always been alone?

945
01:13:14,614 --> 01:13:16,249
Did you ever have someone?

946
01:13:17,816 --> 01:13:19,984
Do you know what
happened to you? Do you?

947
01:13:19,986 --> 01:13:22,155
Because I don't. I don't know
what happened to me.

948
01:13:23,589 --> 01:13:24,921
I don't know.

949
01:13:24,923 --> 01:13:27,358
I look in the mirror and the
only thing that I recognize

950
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:28,929
are these eyes...

951
01:13:29,762 --> 01:13:31,998
in this old man's face.

952
01:13:37,102 --> 01:13:39,336
You know, sometimes I think
I was either born too early

953
01:13:39,338 --> 01:13:40,706
or too late for my life.

954
01:13:43,776 --> 01:13:47,177
Maybe we're both just relics.

955
01:13:47,179 --> 01:13:49,213
<i>Security
measures have been increased</i>

956
01:13:49,215 --> 01:13:50,413
<i>to maximum levels.</i>

957
01:13:50,415 --> 01:13:54,053
<i>Prepare to present your
identity and clearance cards.</i>

958
01:13:57,490 --> 01:13:58,922
<i>Attention.</i>

959
01:13:58,924 --> 01:14:01,725
<i>Security measures have been
increased to maximum levels.</i>

960
01:14:01,727 --> 01:14:03,860
Sir, I've got them.

961
01:14:03,862 --> 01:14:06,365
Zelda, Elisa. All right.

962
01:14:09,201 --> 01:14:10,337
Here we go.

963
01:14:12,304 --> 01:14:13,336
Mmm-hmm.

964
01:14:13,338 --> 01:14:16,172
Looks like you two punched out
before the incident.

965
01:14:16,174 --> 01:14:17,942
Still.

966
01:14:17,944 --> 01:14:20,476
If you know something
about what transpired here

967
01:14:20,478 --> 01:14:23,213
it's your obligation...

968
01:14:23,215 --> 01:14:24,815
to report any detail,

969
01:14:24,817 --> 01:14:27,851
no matter how small
or trivial it may seem.

970
01:14:27,853 --> 01:14:30,054
"Trivial" means unimportant.

971
01:14:30,056 --> 01:14:34,091
I didn't see nothing
out of the ordinary, no.

972
01:14:34,093 --> 01:14:35,525
Or trivial.

973
01:14:35,527 --> 01:14:37,295
See, my feet were hurting.

974
01:14:37,297 --> 01:14:38,464
What about you?

975
01:14:40,566 --> 01:14:42,468
She didn't see anything.

976
01:14:44,303 --> 01:14:45,404
Mmm.

977
01:14:52,244 --> 01:14:54,311
Hoffstetler, Dr. Hoffstetler.

978
01:14:54,313 --> 01:14:57,081
Did either of you see him
coming in or out of the lab?

979
01:14:57,083 --> 01:14:59,050
He works there, doesn't he?

980
01:14:59,052 --> 01:15:03,389
I mean in a different way,
doing something different.

981
01:15:04,789 --> 01:15:06,926
Something trivial?

982
01:15:07,493 --> 01:15:08,829
No, sir.

983
01:15:22,674 --> 01:15:27,179
What am I doing,
interviewing the fucking help?

984
01:15:28,548 --> 01:15:30,250
The shit cleaners.

985
01:15:31,250 --> 01:15:33,119
The piss wipers.

986
01:15:36,454 --> 01:15:38,824
You two, go ahead. Leave.

987
01:15:43,829 --> 01:15:47,299
All right, you're clear.
So, back to work. Go on.

988
01:15:49,067 --> 01:15:50,503
What'd you say to me?

989
01:15:55,342 --> 01:15:56,777
What is she saying?

990
01:15:58,544 --> 01:15:59,846
I didn't catch it.

991
01:16:00,679 --> 01:16:02,011
What is she saying?

992
01:16:02,013 --> 01:16:04,517
She... she is saying thank you.

993
01:16:14,694 --> 01:16:16,062
Next!

994
01:16:33,512 --> 01:16:38,015
<i>I didn't see you
last night or the night before.</i>

995
01:16:38,017 --> 01:16:39,449
<i>I'm sorry, Ed,</i>

996
01:16:39,451 --> 01:16:41,118
<i>but now that I'm spending
all day long in the office,</i>

997
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:43,621
<i>Carol feels that I... I should
spend my evenings with her.</i>

998
01:16:43,623 --> 01:16:46,457
<i>Well, if you
spend the evenings with her,</i>

999
01:16:46,459 --> 01:16:47,692
<i>when will I?</i>

1000
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:58,270
<i>There's only
one thing left to do.</i>

1001
01:16:59,271 --> 01:17:00,470
<i>Volunteer.</i>

1002
01:17:29,435 --> 01:17:31,137
No! No, no, no, no, no!

1003
01:17:55,026 --> 01:17:57,394
I wanna get home early.

1004
01:17:57,396 --> 01:18:00,500
Brewster's been in
a bad mood lately.

1005
01:18:03,436 --> 01:18:04,435
Holy Jesus!

1006
01:18:04,437 --> 01:18:06,103
What are you doin'
standing in the shadows

1007
01:18:06,105 --> 01:18:07,438
of the women's locker room?

1008
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:09,373
They may be watching me,
and there are no cameras here.

1009
01:18:09,375 --> 01:18:10,408
For good reason.

1010
01:18:10,410 --> 01:18:12,275
But have you caught us
at an inconvenient moment!

1011
01:18:12,277 --> 01:18:14,110
I need to know
that he's alright.

1012
01:18:14,112 --> 01:18:16,180
- He is.
- When will you release him?

1013
01:18:16,182 --> 01:18:17,381
Soon.

1014
01:18:17,383 --> 01:18:20,487
When the rain fills the canal
that flows to the sea.

1015
01:18:23,621 --> 01:18:25,488
If you need anything...

1016
01:18:25,490 --> 01:18:27,060
Release him. Soon.

1017
01:18:30,562 --> 01:18:32,261
What did she say?

1018
01:18:32,263 --> 01:18:34,935
She said you're a good man,
Dr. Hoffstetler.

1019
01:18:37,971 --> 01:18:39,638
My name is Dimitri.

1020
01:18:42,976 --> 01:18:44,444
Honored to meet you.

1021
01:18:46,379 --> 01:18:48,546
Hey, dummy!
Phone call for you.

1022
01:18:48,548 --> 01:18:50,413
It's urgent.

1023
01:18:55,989 --> 01:18:57,523
Don't worry about me.
I'm fine.

1024
01:18:58,523 --> 01:18:59,526
Believe me. I'm fine.

1025
01:19:00,593 --> 01:19:01,958
He ate Pandora.

1026
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:04,360
Wasn't his fault.
He's a wild creature.

1027
01:19:04,362 --> 01:19:06,662
We can't ask him
to be anything else.

1028
01:19:06,664 --> 01:19:08,465
Elisa, go find him.

1029
01:19:08,467 --> 01:19:10,466
Go. Go.

1030
01:19:10,468 --> 01:19:11,801
Go!

1031
01:19:13,405 --> 01:19:14,505
You're lucky.

1032
01:20:16,869 --> 01:20:18,405
Ow.

1033
01:20:19,804 --> 01:20:22,206
I stayed awake
as long as I could.

1034
01:20:22,208 --> 01:20:24,177
You know,
I'm not even mad anymore.

1035
01:20:24,944 --> 01:20:26,413
Is he all right?
You sure?

1036
01:20:29,715 --> 01:20:31,047
Where you going?

1037
01:20:31,049 --> 01:20:32,518
No, no.

1038
01:20:33,585 --> 01:20:34,417
Okay, don't... no, no.

1039
01:20:34,419 --> 01:20:35,885
Don't... don't play
with the kitties.

1040
01:20:35,887 --> 01:20:36,987
No, no.

1041
01:20:36,989 --> 01:20:38,622
Don't play with the kitties.

1042
01:20:38,624 --> 01:20:40,392
I'm not... I'm not angry.

1043
01:20:44,597 --> 01:20:46,764
Oh, my!

1044
01:20:55,141 --> 01:20:56,373
You did that. It's okay.

1045
01:20:56,375 --> 01:20:58,078
It's... ooh. I don't
think that's sanitary.

1046
01:21:01,914 --> 01:21:03,450
Enough.

1047
01:21:06,819 --> 01:21:08,687
Oh, God.

1048
01:21:14,127 --> 01:21:15,661
Interesting guy.

1049
01:21:19,197 --> 01:21:20,631
<i>All personnel
prepare to present</i>

1050
01:21:20,633 --> 01:21:22,832
<i>your identity
and clearance cards.</i>

1051
01:21:22,834 --> 01:21:24,369
You wanted to see me?

1052
01:21:27,839 --> 01:21:29,171
How's it going?

1053
01:21:29,173 --> 01:21:31,108
The investigation?

1054
01:21:31,110 --> 01:21:32,745
Well, we have
a promising lead.

1055
01:21:33,579 --> 01:21:34,714
Really?

1056
01:21:36,915 --> 01:21:38,183
That's good to hear.

1057
01:21:39,419 --> 01:21:41,150
You joined us in Galveston,

1058
01:21:41,152 --> 01:21:43,153
but where were
you before, Hoffstetler?

1059
01:21:43,155 --> 01:21:44,788
- Doctor.
- Excuse me?

1060
01:21:44,790 --> 01:21:46,726
Doctor Hoffstetler.

1061
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:50,295
Protocol.

1062
01:21:52,197 --> 01:21:54,131
Wisconsin. Madison.

1063
01:21:54,133 --> 01:21:55,332
Oh that's right.

1064
01:21:55,334 --> 01:21:57,868
You gave up a tenure
track position, didn't you?

1065
01:21:57,870 --> 01:22:01,508
Gave it all up for us.

1066
01:22:04,075 --> 01:22:05,676
I suppose...

1067
01:22:05,678 --> 01:22:09,046
you'll be getting ready
to leave us now then, huh?

1068
01:22:09,048 --> 01:22:10,782
Only if the creature
isn't found.

1069
01:22:14,085 --> 01:22:15,284
Well, what do you think?

1070
01:22:15,286 --> 01:22:16,519
You think we will find it?

1071
01:22:16,521 --> 01:22:18,924
Well, you said
you had a lead.

1072
01:22:20,092 --> 01:22:21,594
I do.

1073
01:25:11,896 --> 01:25:13,365
Why you smiling, hon?

1074
01:25:15,267 --> 01:25:16,869
Stop looking like that.

1075
01:25:19,472 --> 01:25:20,940
What happened?

1076
01:25:24,676 --> 01:25:25,878
Why?

1077
01:25:27,044 --> 01:25:28,513
How?

1078
01:25:29,548 --> 01:25:30,650
How?

1079
01:25:31,850 --> 01:25:33,852
Does he have a...?

1080
01:25:39,991 --> 01:25:41,360
Mm-hmm.

1081
01:25:42,828 --> 01:25:44,062
Mm-hmm.

1082
01:25:51,602 --> 01:25:53,804
Oh!

1083
01:25:53,806 --> 01:25:55,872
Never trust a man.

1084
01:25:55,874 --> 01:25:58,207
Even when he looks
flat down there.

1085
01:27:18,391 --> 01:27:19,659
Hmm.

1086
01:28:00,531 --> 01:28:03,565
<i>You rang?</i>

1087
01:28:03,567 --> 01:28:06,536
<i>Oh, hi, Maynard. I
just signed up for anthropology.</i>

1088
01:28:06,538 --> 01:28:09,805
<i>We're gonna hold class in the
Amazon jungle in South America.</i>

1089
01:28:09,807 --> 01:28:11,741
<i>South America?
Ooh, man, Dob.</i>

1090
01:28:11,743 --> 01:28:13,476
<i>You're gonna have to get up awful early
in the morning. That's a long hike.</i>

1091
01:28:13,478 --> 01:28:15,377
<i>No, Maynard, we're gonna stay down there.</i>

1092
01:28:15,379 --> 01:28:18,282
<i>- We are?
- Oh, no, you're not coming along, too.</i>

1093
01:28:18,284 --> 01:28:21,853
This is a gelatin parfait.

1094
01:28:22,487 --> 01:28:23,886
You're gonna love it.

1095
01:28:23,888 --> 01:28:25,055
<i>Dad, can we watch Bonanza?</i>

1096
01:28:25,057 --> 01:28:27,457
<i>Bonanza is much too violent.</i>

1097
01:28:27,459 --> 01:28:28,725
You know what
I was thinking today?

1098
01:28:28,727 --> 01:28:31,862
We get the kids
a P-U-P-P-Y.

1099
01:30:30,848 --> 01:30:32,716
Let's go. Come on.

1100
01:30:32,718 --> 01:30:33,953
Let's get out of here.

1101
01:31:20,766 --> 01:31:21,864
What is going on?!

1102
01:31:21,866 --> 01:31:24,234
I've got water
pouring into my theater!

1103
01:31:24,236 --> 01:31:26,936
I have four paying customers!
I've got to offer refunds.

1104
01:31:26,938 --> 01:31:28,305
It's probably a pipe.
I'll take care of it.

1105
01:31:28,307 --> 01:31:30,107
- You don't fix it, no more rent!
- I will fix it.

1106
01:31:47,392 --> 01:31:49,929
Elisa?

1107
01:31:51,730 --> 01:31:53,933
Dear God. Elisa!

1108
01:32:23,594 --> 01:32:25,431
I'm toweling my hair!

1109
01:32:26,365 --> 01:32:27,967
It's my hair.

1110
01:32:28,767 --> 01:32:30,766
Ah, just...

1111
01:32:30,768 --> 01:32:32,301
Oh! Look at my arm.

1112
01:32:32,303 --> 01:32:34,537
The wound. It's like
it was never there.

1113
01:32:34,539 --> 01:32:35,940
Look at that.

1114
01:32:36,607 --> 01:32:38,140
Now you said that...

1115
01:32:38,142 --> 01:32:39,408
you know, he was worshiped
like a god.

1116
01:32:39,410 --> 01:32:40,978
Now, is he a god?
I don't know if he's a god.

1117
01:32:40,980 --> 01:32:43,078
I mean, he ate a cat,
so I don't... I don't know.

1118
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:44,680
I don't know, but, I mean,

1119
01:32:44,682 --> 01:32:46,284
we have to keep him
around awhile.

1120
01:32:47,785 --> 01:32:49,154
Little while.

1121
01:33:08,440 --> 01:33:09,542
Hello?

1122
01:34:50,508 --> 01:34:51,643
<i>Your water, sir.</i>

1123
01:34:53,210 --> 01:34:56,479
- And sir, General Hoyt...
- Mm-mm, mm-mm.

1124
01:34:56,481 --> 01:34:57,646
Tell him I'm not here.

1125
01:34:57,648 --> 01:34:59,814
Tell him I'll call him back.
Don't put him through.

1126
01:34:59,816 --> 01:35:01,117
No, sir...

1127
01:35:01,119 --> 01:35:02,987
He... he's in your office.

1128
01:35:06,157 --> 01:35:09,225
At this point,
our only concern is the asset.

1129
01:35:09,227 --> 01:35:11,664
- Do you have it?
- Still in the winds, sir.

1130
01:35:12,763 --> 01:35:14,032
Well, that won't do.

1131
01:35:14,900 --> 01:35:16,468
Yes, sir, I know.

1132
01:35:18,637 --> 01:35:21,070
You've known me
how long, sir?

1133
01:35:21,072 --> 01:35:23,372
Thirteen years.
Battle of Pusan.

1134
01:35:23,374 --> 01:35:25,108
Yes, sir.

1135
01:35:25,110 --> 01:35:28,177
A man is faithful,
loyal, efficient all his life.

1136
01:35:28,179 --> 01:35:30,747
All of it. And he is...

1137
01:35:30,749 --> 01:35:31,715
useful.

1138
01:35:31,717 --> 01:35:34,320
And he expects...

1139
01:35:35,954 --> 01:35:38,657
He has certain
expectations in return.

1140
01:35:40,592 --> 01:35:43,126
And then, he fails once.

1141
01:35:43,128 --> 01:35:45,894
Only once.
What does that make him?

1142
01:35:45,896 --> 01:35:47,532
That make him a failure?

1143
01:35:51,469 --> 01:35:53,502
When is a man done, sir?

1144
01:35:53,504 --> 01:35:55,671
Proving himself?

1145
01:35:55,673 --> 01:35:57,806
A good man?

1146
01:35:57,808 --> 01:35:59,511
A decent man?

1147
01:36:03,347 --> 01:36:04,984
"Decent?"

1148
01:36:09,420 --> 01:36:13,288
A man has the decency
not to fuck up.

1149
01:36:13,290 --> 01:36:15,024
Now that's one thing.

1150
01:36:15,026 --> 01:36:17,260
That's real decent of him.

1151
01:36:17,262 --> 01:36:19,996
But the other kind of decency?

1152
01:36:19,998 --> 01:36:21,131
It doesn't really matter.

1153
01:36:21,133 --> 01:36:24,233
Well sell it,
but it's an export.

1154
01:36:24,235 --> 01:36:26,638
We sell it,
because we don't use it.

1155
01:36:27,972 --> 01:36:29,838
36 hours from now...

1156
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:33,645
this entire episode
will be over.

1157
01:36:35,513 --> 01:36:36,748
And so will you.

1158
01:36:38,316 --> 01:36:41,484
Our universe
will have a hole in it

1159
01:36:41,486 --> 01:36:43,586
with your outline.

1160
01:36:43,588 --> 01:36:45,889
And you will have moved on

1161
01:36:45,891 --> 01:36:48,326
to an alternate universe.

1162
01:36:49,628 --> 01:36:51,397
A universe of shit.

1163
01:36:53,464 --> 01:36:56,134
You'll be lost
to civilization.

1164
01:36:58,335 --> 01:37:01,205
And you will be unborn.

1165
01:37:02,539 --> 01:37:04,575
Unmade.

1166
01:37:05,843 --> 01:37:07,413
And undone.

1167
01:37:14,018 --> 01:37:16,621
So go get some
real decency, son.

1168
01:37:17,755 --> 01:37:19,689
And unfuck this mess.

1169
01:37:55,593 --> 01:37:57,292
36 hours.

1170
01:37:57,294 --> 01:37:59,261
36 hours. Well, shit.

1171
01:37:59,263 --> 01:38:01,064
You deliver. You deliver,
that's what you do.

1172
01:38:01,066 --> 01:38:03,132
You deliver! Right? Right?!

1173
01:38:56,120 --> 01:38:57,889

01:40:53,004 --> 01:40:57,140
if you don't know now.

1201
01:41:19,630 --> 01:41:20,798
Elisa...

1202
01:41:23,101 --> 01:41:24,670
What is it, honey?

1203
01:41:51,361 --> 01:41:52,963
This isn't good.

1204
01:41:55,734 --> 01:41:57,669
I'm gonna call Dr. Hoffstetler.

1205
01:41:59,803 --> 01:42:01,672
We gotta release him
tonight, honey.

1206
01:42:02,339 --> 01:42:03,975
I'll come back and help you.

1207
01:42:28,398 --> 01:42:29,733
He's coming out.

1208
01:42:35,740 --> 01:42:37,372
Ah, fuck.

1209
01:42:41,946 --> 01:42:44,313
Sir, if you don't
mind me saying, you...

1210
01:42:44,315 --> 01:42:45,683
you don't look so well.

1211
01:42:46,351 --> 01:42:47,719
Shut up.

1212
01:42:50,053 --> 01:42:52,020
Can you smell that?
I mean...

1213
01:42:52,022 --> 01:42:54,123
I think it's your fingers.
They're... they're...

1214
01:42:54,125 --> 01:42:56,594
- Mmm.
- black.

1215
01:43:01,132 --> 01:43:02,966
There he is.

1216
01:43:02,968 --> 01:43:04,632
Doctor-fucking-shirtbird.

1217
01:43:04,634 --> 01:43:06,435
Oh, there's no cause
for cursing, sir.

1218
01:43:11,209 --> 01:43:13,178
Get out of the car.
I'm taking it.

1219
01:43:14,379 --> 01:43:15,610
This is my car.

1220
01:43:15,612 --> 01:43:17,145
Get the fuck out.

1221
01:43:17,147 --> 01:43:18,650
Out of my car?

1222
01:43:19,316 --> 01:43:20,918
Did I stutter?

1223
01:44:53,712 --> 01:44:55,144
Strickland! Thank God!

1224
01:44:55,146 --> 01:44:57,713
You were speaking Russian...

1225
01:44:57,715 --> 01:44:58,780
Bob.

1226
01:45:10,660 --> 01:45:11,894
What's your name?

1227
01:45:11,896 --> 01:45:14,729
- Hoffstetler.
- No, no. Don't lie.

1228
01:45:14,731 --> 01:45:16,030
You don't need to.

1229
01:45:16,032 --> 01:45:18,967
You took a bullet to the gut.

1230
01:45:18,969 --> 01:45:20,202
You're dead.

1231
01:45:20,204 --> 01:45:21,804
I need the names, ranks

1232
01:45:21,806 --> 01:45:24,172
and location
of the entire strike team.

1233
01:45:24,174 --> 01:45:25,841
"Strike team?"

1234
01:45:25,843 --> 01:45:28,744
The ones who took the asset!

1235
01:45:37,554 --> 01:45:40,956
This candy.
It's cheap candy, but I love it.

1236
01:45:40,958 --> 01:45:43,759
Ever since I was a kid.

1237
01:45:43,761 --> 01:45:47,028
Now some folks favor
more sophisticated snacks,

1238
01:45:47,030 --> 01:45:50,498
nougat center
and all that foo-foo shit.

1239
01:45:50,500 --> 01:45:52,670
But not me, Bob!

1240
01:45:53,504 --> 01:45:54,839
This is it for me.

1241
01:45:57,708 --> 01:46:00,309
Now sometimes
if I'm feeling anxious,

1242
01:46:00,311 --> 01:46:01,346
I just bite right into it.

1243
01:46:02,079 --> 01:46:04,046
But mostly,

1244
01:46:04,048 --> 01:46:05,749
I take my time.

1245
01:46:06,250 --> 01:46:07,617
I make it last.

1246
01:46:12,923 --> 01:46:14,556
Names, ranks,

1247
01:46:14,558 --> 01:46:16,559
and location
of the strike team.

1248
01:46:20,263 --> 01:46:22,497
Names! Ranks! Now!

1249
01:46:27,170 --> 01:46:28,673
No names.

1250
01:46:29,941 --> 01:46:31,343
No ranks.

1251
01:46:32,176 --> 01:46:33,712
They...

1252
01:46:34,445 --> 01:46:35,743
They just clean.

1253
01:46:46,956 --> 01:46:49,158
Alright, Brewster, 
I'm gonna fix your dinner,

1254
01:46:49,160 --> 01:46:51,930
and then I'm gonna run out for a
little while and help a friend.

1255
01:46:53,330 --> 01:46:54,630
Help with what?

1256
01:46:54,632 --> 01:46:56,165
Help a friend.

1257
01:46:58,502 --> 01:47:00,335
Zelda...

1258
01:47:00,337 --> 01:47:01,772
the door.

1259
01:47:05,209 --> 01:47:07,842
Well, you could help me
and answer the door, Brewster.

1260
01:47:07,844 --> 01:47:10,112
You're sitting right here
just ten feet away from it!

1261
01:47:10,114 --> 01:47:11,980
My back's aching me, woman.
Now, move!

1262
01:47:11,982 --> 01:47:14,252
Your back, your back?
Always your back!

1263
01:47:17,487 --> 01:47:18,856
Mr. Strickland.

1264
01:47:19,589 --> 01:47:21,390
What are you doing here?

1265
01:47:21,392 --> 01:47:22,725
Who's that man, Zelda?

1266
01:47:22,727 --> 01:47:24,025
Where is it?

1267
01:47:24,027 --> 01:47:25,560
- What are you talking about?
- Where did you take it?

1268
01:47:25,562 --> 01:47:26,889
What are you talking about?
I... I don't...

1269
01:47:26,914 --> 01:47:27,355
Zelda!

1270
01:47:29,667 --> 01:47:32,736
The thing in the lab.

1271
01:47:34,038 --> 01:47:34,970
Where is it?

1272
01:47:34,972 --> 01:47:37,108
- Listen, fella...
- Sit down!

1273
01:47:46,517 --> 01:47:47,649
I'm sorry, sir.

1274
01:47:47,651 --> 01:47:50,087
If I knew anything,
I would surely tell you.

1275
01:47:54,525 --> 01:47:56,695
That story about Samson.

1276
01:47:57,660 --> 01:47:59,795
I never told you how it ends.

1277
01:47:59,797 --> 01:48:04,369
After the Philistines
torture him and blind him...

1278
01:48:05,803 --> 01:48:09,007
Samson asks God
for the strength he needs.

1279
01:48:10,708 --> 01:48:13,809
And at the last minute,
he is spared.

1280
01:48:13,811 --> 01:48:18,581
And the Lord gives him
his strength back...

1281
01:48:18,583 --> 01:48:19,951
one last time.

1282
01:48:22,620 --> 01:48:25,123
And he holds...

1283
01:48:25,990 --> 01:48:29,358
the columns of the temple...

1284
01:48:29,360 --> 01:48:30,826
with his powerful arms.

1285
01:48:30,828 --> 01:48:33,732
And he crushes them.

1286
01:48:45,209 --> 01:48:46,908
And he brings
the whole building

1287
01:48:46,910 --> 01:48:49,012
down on the Philistines.

1288
01:48:54,451 --> 01:48:55,951
He dies...

1289
01:48:55,953 --> 01:49:00,258
but he gets every single
one of those motherfuckers.

1290
01:49:00,857 --> 01:49:02,226
That is his will!

1291
01:49:06,196 --> 01:49:10,968
Now, do you know what that
particular story means...

1292
01:49:11,902 --> 01:49:14,403
for us, Delilah?

1293
01:49:14,405 --> 01:49:16,872
It means if you know something
you're not telling me

1294
01:49:16,874 --> 01:49:18,841
you're gonna tell me

1295
01:49:18,843 --> 01:49:22,944
either before or after

1296
01:49:22,946 --> 01:49:25,350
I bring
this particular temple...

1297
01:49:26,683 --> 01:49:30,385
down upon our heads.

1298
01:49:30,387 --> 01:49:32,820
Gal stole that
thing right out the lab,

1299
01:49:32,822 --> 01:49:34,389
whatever it is.

1300
01:49:34,391 --> 01:49:36,757
Mute girl took it.

1301
01:49:36,759 --> 01:49:39,563
I heard my wife talking
on the phone about it.

1302
01:49:44,067 --> 01:49:46,368
Thank you very much,
Mr. Fuller,

1303
01:49:46,370 --> 01:49:48,172
for your assistance.

1304
01:49:59,284 --> 01:50:01,117
What have you done?

1305
01:50:01,119 --> 01:50:01,917
Zelda.

1306
01:50:01,919 --> 01:50:03,051
I gotta warn her.

1307
01:50:03,053 --> 01:50:04,752
He's going after her.

1308
01:50:04,754 --> 01:50:06,954
You will do
no such thing, woman.

1309
01:50:06,956 --> 01:50:08,290
Why are you worrying about her?

1310
01:50:08,292 --> 01:50:09,690
She broke the law.

1311
01:50:09,692 --> 01:50:11,862
Shut up, Brewster!
You shut up!

1312
01:50:12,562 --> 01:50:14,464
Years, you don't talk...

1313
01:50:15,833 --> 01:50:18,734
and now you can't
shut your mouth!

1314
01:50:18,736 --> 01:50:20,104
Damn you, Brewster.

1315
01:50:22,440 --> 01:50:24,340
You wouldn't understand.

1316
01:50:24,342 --> 01:50:28,810
Couldn't understand, not if
you tried your whole life.

1317
01:50:28,812 --> 01:50:30,945
<i>- Hello?
- Giles, is that you?</i>

1318
01:50:30,947 --> 01:50:32,950
<i>- Yes.
- Okay. Put Elisa on the phone.</i>

1319
01:50:33,551 --> 01:50:34,552
It's Zelda.

1320
01:50:36,253 --> 01:50:39,287
Elisa, honey, make a sound
on the phone if you can hear.

1321
01:50:40,490 --> 01:50:41,491
<i>Okay, good.</i>

1322
01:50:42,159 --> 01:50:43,692
He's coming for you.

1323
01:50:43,694 --> 01:50:46,362
<i>You gotta go now, and you gotta
take that thing with you.</i>

1324
01:50:46,364 --> 01:50:47,464
What? Elisa?

1325
01:50:55,972 --> 01:50:58,575
Hey! Watch out!
Learn how to drive!

1326
01:51:28,606 --> 01:51:30,008
Damn it.

1327
01:51:41,585 --> 01:51:43,186
We have to go.

1328
01:51:45,556 --> 01:51:47,221
Where are you?

1329
01:51:47,223 --> 01:51:48,823
Where the fuck are you?

1330
01:54:12,469 --> 01:54:14,271
I do not fail.

1331
01:54:15,905 --> 01:54:17,340
I deliver.

1332
01:54:22,480 --> 01:54:23,614
Elisa!

1333
01:54:24,815 --> 01:54:26,484
Elisa.

1334
01:54:35,293 --> 01:54:36,294
No.

1335
01:55:24,475 --> 01:55:25,575
Fuck.

1336
01:55:26,776 --> 01:55:28,411
You are a god.

1337
01:56:02,812 --> 01:56:04,181
Look, man on the ground.

1338
01:56:05,014 --> 01:56:06,450
Watch him.

1339
01:56:13,289 --> 01:56:15,625
You there! Call an ambulance!

1340
01:57:35,438 --> 01:57:37,338
<i>If I told you about her,</i>

1341
01:57:37,340 --> 01:57:39,407
<i>what would I say?</i>

1342
01:57:39,409 --> 01:57:42,344
<i>That they lived
happily ever after?</i>

1343
01:57:42,346 --> 01:57:44,880
<i>I believe they did.</i>

1344
01:57:44,882 --> 01:57:48,884
<i>That they were in love,
that they remained in love?</i>

1345
01:57:48,886 --> 01:57:50,888
<i>I'm sure that's true.</i>

1346
01:57:51,655 --> 01:57:53,724
<i>But when I think of her...</i>

1347
01:57:54,659 --> 01:57:56,859

1348
01:57:56,861 --> 01:57:59,827
