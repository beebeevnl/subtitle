That's 'cause I haven't told you
what she fishes for.

00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,200
Check your valuables, sir.
This woman is a known thief.

335
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,435
No, I'm okay.

336
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,639
Here she comes.

337
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,480

Get back here!

- Stop!
- Get back here!

351

It's not bad.

She's in.

353

the misdirection of the target is the key.

And now you can rob poor tourists together.

mashing the brake at the same time.
