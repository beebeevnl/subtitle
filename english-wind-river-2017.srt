00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,660
<i>There's a meadow</i>

2
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,490
<i>in my perfect world...</i>

3
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,500
<i>where wind dances the branches of a tree,</i>

4
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:36,700
<i>casting leopard spots of light
across the face of a pond.</i>

5
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:39,300
<i>The tree stands tall</i>

6
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,510
<i>and grand and alone,</i>

7
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,710
<i>shading the world beneath it.</i>

8
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:59,420
<i>It is here, in the cradle
of all I hold dear,</i>

9
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,290
<i>I guard every memory of you.</i>

10
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,270
<i>And when I find myself frozen

11
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,700
<i>far from your loving eyes...</i>

12
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:16,210
<i>I will return to this place, close mine,</i>

13
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,080
<i>and take solace in the simple perfection

14
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:47,000
<b>FarangSiam thanks you.
Enjoy!</b>

15
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,250
Hey.

16
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,650
You got blood on your shirt.

17
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:11,420
Uh, yeah, I just came from work.

18
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,620
Who was the victim today?

19
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,790
Looks like it's gonna be me.

20
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,360
Want some coffee?

21
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,430
Sure.

22
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,430
So, I gotta go to the rez tomorrow.
[Indian Reserve]

23
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:55,600
Figure I'd take Casey by to see your folks.

24
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,870
Hmm.

25
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,770
Something killed a yearling in the pasture
behind their house.

26
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,820
Yeah, that's why I'm going.

27
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,610
Don't let Casey out of your sight
on the rez.

28
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,360
- Okay?
- No, like I said,

29
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,480
I'm gonna leave him with your folks
while I scout.

30
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,650
You know, it's too cold to drag him
through the snow,

31
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,930
- so...
- You know what I mean.

32
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,520
Yep.

33
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,860
Yeah.

34
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:22,190
Case!

35
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,530
- Dad?
- Come on, bud.

36
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,330
- Okay. I'm coming.
- Time to go.

37
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,170
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa whoa.

38
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,130
What's your BB gun pointed at right now?

39
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,910
Come here. Come down here.

40
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,240
Sorry, Dad.

41
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,840
Hey. What's the rule, bud?

42
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,850
Okay? Gun's always loaded,
even if it ain't.

43
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,350
Right?

44
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,550
- Yes.
- Okay. Come on, buddy.

45
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,550
Put that in the truck. Hurry up.

46
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,650
- Okay.
- Don't run.

47
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:58,430
I'll be back Monday afternoon.

48
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,270
Just be careful on the road, okay?

49
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:05,300
This won't be my first snowstorm in a car.

50
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,240
Okay.

51
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,370
Is this it?

52
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,810
Yeah.

53
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,930
Here you go, buddy.

54
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,790
You know, it's a good town, Wilma.

55
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,590
They got good schools there.

56
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,860
If I get the job, we're gonna have to talk

57
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:30,460
about his child support.

58
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,540
Jackson's a lot more expensive.

59
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,330
Well, you go get that job,

60
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,230
and we'll figure it out from there.

61
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,830
Don't you worry about it.

62
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,800
Take Togwotee Pass.

63
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,870
And don't go through Pinedale, okay?

64
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:46,280
This, uh, this storm's comin'
from the south, so...

65
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:50,210
Yeah, you couldn't drag me
through Pinedale with a rope.

66
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,750
I'll never set foot in that town again.

67
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,950
Well, good luck, okay?

68
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,510
Better hurry it up... it's hungry.

69
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,540
Chow time, boys.

70
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,710
You okay?

71
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,780
Fine.

72
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,550
You gotta push his nose back

73
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,550
when he rubs up on you like that.

74
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,650
- Okay?
- 'Kay.

75
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,820
Yuck.

76
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,820
Told you I'd get that hat dirty.

77
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:31,460
He's got the height advantage on me
is the deal.

78
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:32,760
Is that right?

79
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,460
Well, let's fix that.

80
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,890
Come on.

81
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,900
You're gonna earn his respect, buddy.

82
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,900
You know how you do that?

83
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:43,000
By standing your own ground.

84
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:45,000
So, let's get you up on there.

85
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,670
So, like I showed you, right?

86
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,310
Up.

87
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,480
Who's got the height advantage now?

88
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,480
Huh? Who's got the height advantage?

89
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,580
Let's back him up.

90
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,850
Be gentle.

91
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,620
Till he tells you not to be.

92
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:01,390
Take him around.

93
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,690
That's it.

94
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,890
Pass right by his food.

95
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,770
Keep on going, keep on going.

96
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:12,030
There you go. You show him who's boss.

97
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,470
Want to sidepass him over this way?

98
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,330
Whoa.

99
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,470
There you go.

100
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,070
That's it, son.

101
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,410
Keep coming.

102
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:28,620
Back him up.

103
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,780
He wants the food. Back him up.

104
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,790
Look at that.

105
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,050
All right, come on in.

106
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,860
How about that!

107
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,020
Good job. Come over here.

108
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,830
Put your hand up on his nose.

109
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,630
Let him smell you, let him breathe you,

110
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,960
let him know you.

111
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,830
He'll love you forever.

112
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,700
Okay?

113
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,610
Hey.

114
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,770
So, what do you think of that, son?

115
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,810
That was pretty cowboy, huh?

116
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,480
No, son.

117
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,880
That was all Arapaho.

118
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:39,550
Hey, grandson! Hey!

119
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,720
Grandma's making you fry bread.

120
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,850
- Did you have breakfast?
- Just eggs.

121
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,860
Well, go ahead, get you some!

122
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,700
- Horses sense the storm, huh?
- Yeah.

123
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:56,670
So, uh, police chief call you
to hunt the lion, eh?

124
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,000
Well, he called me to hunt something.

125
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,440
- Yeah.
- Heard you lost a steer.

126
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,440
Yeah. I'll show you where.

127
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,490
- It's a lion.
- Is that right?

128
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,740
Come on.

129
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,750
How's Wilma?

130
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,150
She got a job interview in Jackson.

131
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,050
Some hotel, I think.

132
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:16,060
- Jackson Hole.
- Yeah.

133
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,050
Going to live with the millionaires, eh?

134
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,060
Well, I don't know about that.

135
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:21,560
I think the billionaires

136
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:24,230
chased out the millionaires years ago.

137
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,230
Well, save your money.

138
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:29,870
When the wolves start eating
their golden retrievers,

139
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:33,500
that land's gonna go for pennies
on the dollar.

140
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,170
Yes, sir.

141
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,880
Tell me what that is.

142
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,160
Yeah.

143
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:00,060
Well, it's a lion, all right.

144
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,230
There's two.

145
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,070
Three of 'em.

146
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,910
She's got both of last year's kits
with her.

147
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,740
They chased your steer around for a while,
it seems.

148
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,510
That's what the tracks say.

149
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:17,960
Mama's teaching her kids how to hunt.

150
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,630
She's teaching them on livestock.

151
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,700
Mama just got her whole family killed.

152
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:42,570
You got gas in your sled?

Come back.

163

<i>Fremont County Sheriff's Office.</i>

164
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,250
What's your location?

165
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:50,930
The Wind River Indian Reservation,

166
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,200
east of Boulder Flats.

167
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:58,860
FBI taking a while, eh?

168
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,930
Yeah, the road out of Riverton's bad.

169
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:03,810
I don't want to move her
until they have a look,

170
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,480
but I'm not gonna try to pull her out
after dark.

171
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,940
We gotta get this show on the road.

172
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:13,010
We're losing the tracks, Ben.

173
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,850
Well, it is coming down pretty good.

174
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,550
You should let me follow 'em
while I still can.

175
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,220
Can't let you do that,

176
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:25,090
until it's okayed by the FBI, Cory.

177
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,260
You call her folks yet?

178
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:30,260
No. I want to take the body to Lander.

179
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,160
I know it looks like Natalie...

180
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,230
It's Natalie.

181
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,280
There's your Feds.

182
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,510
Where are these fools going?

183
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:54,280
- They can't see the road.
- We don't have time for this.

184
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:58,090
I'll get 'em.

185
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,090
<i>Your destination is on the left.</i>

186
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,430
<i>Turn left.</i>

187
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,230
- You FBI?
- Are you tribal police?

188
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:11,110
No, I'm here to take you to them.

189
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,050
Look, they're very close.
Just follow me, okay?

190
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:15,240
Yeah.

191
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,990
I'm Jane Banner.

192
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,330
You by yourself?

193
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,330
Yeah. It's just me.

194
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,970
I'm Ben Shoyo...
I'm the tribal police chief.

195
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,440
That's Cory Lambert,
with Fish and Wildlife.

196
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:46,720
He's the one who found the body.

197
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:50,370
And this is his, uh, father-in-law, Dan.

198
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,080
He don't do nothin'.

199
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:55,180
We got the same job, eh?

200
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:57,950
Well, um, I'm sorry to meet
under these circumstances.

201
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:01,220
So, do you want to show me the body?

202
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,970
I don't mean to be rude...
I'm just freezing

203
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:05,260
my ass off here, so...
the quicker, the-the better.

204
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,040
Yeah? Well, that's gonna get a lot worse

205
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,690
if you go out there dressed like that.

206
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:10,700
The body's five miles on snowmobile.

207
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,560
I'm afraid you'd be dead
by the time we got there.

208
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,230
Okay. I-I got the call
when I was at a weapons course

209
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,600
in Riverton, so this is...
this is what I've got.

210
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,580
Well, you should have a winter gear bag

211
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,140
- in that truck.
- Well, um, no,

212
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,990
that's not a government vehicle,
it's a rental.

213
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,140
I flew in from Vegas.

214
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,080
So I'm just the closest agent
to the scene.

215
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,610
You don't... you don't think I can...

216
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,160
I can make it?

217
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:32,220
- Oh, you're from Vegas?
- No, I'm not... I'm not

218
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,530
from Vegas; I'm stationed there.

219
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,710
I'm from Fort Lauderdale.

220
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,460
I'm sorry, if we're gonna keep

221
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,910
- having this conversation...
- Let's get you fixed up inside.

222
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,160
- It's gonna be great.
- Thanks.

223
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:41,140
Sorry. Excuse me.

224
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,920
Thanks.

225
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,460
- See what they send us?
- Yeah.

226
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:53,470
Thermals can make underwear
wedge up your bottom.

227
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:57,340
But I guess yours are already there.

228
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,010
Here, these should fit.

229
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,240
You're skinny.

230
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,150
Thank you.

231
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,390
Do you have gloves?

232
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,270
No.

233
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:20,260
Goodness. What were
they thinking sending you here?

234
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,240
Thank you.

235
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,370
And you bring them back
the minute you're done.

236
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,080
They were my granddaughter's.

237
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,340
They ain't a gift.

238
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,180
You hear me?

239
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:38,210
Yeah, of course.

240
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,120
Okay.

241
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,610
'Kay.

242
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:54,330
Hey, buddy.

243
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,370
Um... I'm gonna need

244
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,570
a couple more hours, for work.

245
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,140
A couple.

246
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:03,040
This is our day.

247
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:05,510
I promise. Okay?

248
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,610
Okay.

249
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,710
- Hang with Grandpa.
- It's letting up. Let's go.

250
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,230
God, it was a blizzard 20 minutes ago.

251
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,790
Well, it comes in waves.

252
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,530
Could be sunny for an hour,

253
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,660
then you're right back in hell again.

254
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,530
The storm'll be back.

255
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:07,240
- That's something to look forward to.
- Yeah. Over here.

256
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,440
You got a positive ID?

257
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,350
Not positive, no.

258
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,450
Natalie Hanson.

259
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,650
We'll call that positive for now.

260
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,420
Does she live close by?

261
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,830
Yeah. Fort Wakashie.

262
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,690
It's to the north a ways.

263
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,530
What's «a ways»?

264
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,460
About a 30-minute drive.

265
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,500
Okay, well,
she didn't run from home, then.

266
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,440
No one reported her missing?
Her parents...?

267
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:41,240
Nope.

268
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:49,650
Yeah. That's why we called you.

269
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,650
How experienced is your medical examiner?

270
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,920
Let's just say he... he stays busy.

271
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,350
Uh, order a rape kit.

272
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,600
When he's done with the prelim,

273
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,190
I want her body sent to Loveland.

274
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,900
And make sure her belongings go with her,

275
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:05,460
'cause they need to get tested, too.

276
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,570
I'm listing this as a homicide.

277
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,470
How well do you know this land?

278
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,310
Like it's my job.

279
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,180
'Cause it is.

280
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:22,510
Well, is there anywhere
she could be running from?

281
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,880
Is there anything close by?

282
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:26,780
Nearest house is three
and a half miles from here.

283
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,620
- Southeast.
- Sam Littlefeather's place

284
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:30,220
is over there.

285
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,760
Yep.

286
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,820
Those boys could use
some serious looking into.

287
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,660
There are no structures closer?

288
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:39,630
There's a drill rig five miles from here.

289
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:42,600
They got trailers for the workers, but...

290
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:45,400
- that's closed for the winter.
- Okay, so why would

291
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,870
a teenage girl be out here?

292
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,770
Well, kids come out here
on their snow machines,

293
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,910
and, uh, have a big party in the snow.

294
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,780
Not barefoot, they don't.

295
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,280
What do you think?

296
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,520
I only know what the tracks say.

297
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,390
Okay, well, that's all we got.

298
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,390
Well, come here, I'll show you.

299
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,630
Over here. See this one?
See how the toes turned out,

300
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:16,580
the front is much deeper than the back?

301
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,730
That says she was running.

302
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,800
Come here. I'll show you.

303
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,610
She ran until she dropped here.

304
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,480
See the pool of blood
where her face hit the snow.

305
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:30,680
Now, it gets 20 below here at night,

306
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:33,780
so if you fill your lungs up
with that cold air

307
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:36,350
when you're running,
you could freeze 'em up.

308
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:39,720
Your lungs fill up with blood,
you start coughing it up.

309
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,960
So wherever she came from...

310
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,760
...she ran all the way here.

311
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,630
Her lungs burst here.

312
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:51,800
And she curled up in that tree line

313
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,880
and drowned in her own blood.

314
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,640
Well, how far do you think

315
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:58,540
someone could run barefoot out here?

316
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,450
Oh, I don't know, I...

317
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,380
How do you gauge someone's will to live?

318
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,950
Especially in these conditions.

319
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:12,490
But I knew that girl.

320
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,790
She's a fighter.

321
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:20,330
So no matter how far you think she ran,

322
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,730
I can guarantee you she ran further.

323
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,740
I got to get back to my son.

324
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,580
Hey, um... would you
be willing to help me?

325
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:40,650
Hey, can he assist on this investigation?

326
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,320
What?

327
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,750
He doesn't work for me.

328
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:46,360
And you got a lion to kill, don't forget.

329
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:48,790
There's three of 'em... and I didn't.

330
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:52,870
Sorry, what is it...
what is it that you do again?

331
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,330
I'm a hunter.

332
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:56,380
You're a lion hunter?

333
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,570
I hunt predators.

334
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,640
Good. So why don't you
come hunt one for me, then?

335
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,420
Okay.

336
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:25,900
<i>♫ Will I sit still ♫</i>

337
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:27,900
<i>♫ Or will I feel the wheels... ♫</i>

338
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:43,660
<i>♫ Well, I ain't the brightest
bird that ever flew ♫</i>

339
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,850
<i>♫ I'm just someone you knew. ♫</i>

340
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,120
- Dad?
<i>- ♫ A road you traveled on, all... ♫</i>

341
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,820
Hey, bud.

342
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:53,520
What happened? You can't sleep?

343
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,760
Had a nightmare.

344
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:58,090
That right? What about?

345
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:01,000
<i>♫ They're here and then they're gone... ♫</i>

346
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:03,470
Who was she?

347
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,930
<i>♫ A diamond... ♫</i>

348
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,800
Come here, buddy.

349
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,870
<i>♫ If I can't afford you, darling ♫</i>

350
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:12,040
<i>♫ Then I can't afford to dream... ♫</i>

351
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,720
- Want some milk?
- No.

352
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:18,610
Well...

353
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:21,450
she was a girl that just lost
her way in the snow.

354
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:24,900
That's all. Okay?

355
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,090
What's all this?

356
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,660
That's work, buddy.

357
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,930
Did she die like Emily?

358
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:39,400
She died from the cold.

359
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,110
So she died like Emily.

360
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,040
Yeah, son.

361
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,650
I'm afraid she did.

362
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,760
Hi. Sorry.

363
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,530
Yeah.

364
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,200
See you found town okay.

365
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:09,030
Yeah, barely.

366
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,780
Did the family identify the body?

367
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,840
Yeah.

368
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:16,240
Did they give you a reason
for not reporting her missing?

369
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:18,740
Well, she stayed with a boyfriend some.

370
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,620
They didn't think anything of it.

371
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,010
She was 18, free to do what she wanted.

372
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:25,110
Okay, Randy, you're on the clock.

373
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:28,220
I got about five minutes
of this in me, so let's go.

374
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,820
I'll be quick. Morning.

375
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:33,220
Randy Whitehurst.
I'm the medical examiner.

376
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:36,860
I'm-I'm Jane Banner, FBI.

377
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:38,730
Uh, as you can see here,

378
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,960
she suffered a deep laceration
along her brow line.

379
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,030
Two separated ribs.

380
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:45,840
Frostbite in both feet
up through her ankles,

381
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:48,640
frostbite on her nose
and on her left hand.

382
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:51,170
Uh, the frostbite
on her feet is stage four.

383
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,810
You can tell by the bluing here.

384
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,180
You see that?

385
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:55,780
Yeah.

386
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:58,580
Uh, vaginal wall is torn
in different depths.

387
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,690
You think there are multiple assailants?

388
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,280
Can't determine that.

389
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,720
Could be one assailant who
assaulted her multiple times.

390
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,170
Uh, I swabbed her
and sent the sample by courier

391
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:09,590
to the FBI crime lab in Loveland, Colorado

392
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:11,260
per your request.

393
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:14,060
We should have the DNA results
in six weeks.

394
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:17,300
Uh, those findings might help
us make that determination.

395
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:19,700
What are you listing
as the cause of death?

396
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,840
Well, you're not gonna like it.

397
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:24,140
She died from a pulmonary hemorrhage.

398
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:28,710
When... subzero air
is drawn into the lungs,

399
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,090
it can cause the alveoli...

400
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:32,110
the tiny sacs in the lungs... to burst.

401
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:35,280
Fluid builds in the lungs,
and if the air is cold enough,

402
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,290
the liquid in the lungs will crystallize.

403
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,050
Ultimately, the victim either...

404
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,160
Sorry, you're not listing this
as a homicide?

405
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:42,860
Can't.

406
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:45,290
Uh, s... You have to take

407
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,160
into consideration the circumstances.

408
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,130
She was raped repeatedly, beaten...

409
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:55,840
Look, uh, circumstances
is your field, not mine.

410
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:57,640
- Now, let me... let me show you.
- No.

411
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:58,870
I don't need it explained.

412
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,740
This is very prosecutable as a murder.

413
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,310
I mean, clearly, she wouldn't have been

414
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:04,620
running through the snow
if she hadn't been attacked,

415
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:07,650
but I can't list the cause
of death as homicide.

416
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,620
And I can't get an FBI team
to the reservation

417
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:11,190
unless it's listed as a homicide.

418
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,060
Look, I'm not here to solve this.

419
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:15,630
I'm-I'm just here
to obtain a cause of death

420
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,860
- and send a team here that can.
- Look, present

421
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:20,160
the rape, present the assault, and I'm...

422
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,260
Those don't fall
to the jurisdiction of the FBI.

423
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,100
They fall to the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

424
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:33,680
Huh. Hey, don't look at me.
I'm used to no help.

425
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:36,080
You have six officers on your entire force

426
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:38,110
to cover an area the size of Rhode Island.

427
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,680
Yes, I know that.

428
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,150
No offense, but this will have to curl up

429
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:44,660
in your lap in order for you to solve it.

430
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,760
- I know that, too.
- We all know

431
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,090
it's a murder.

432
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,360
All right, have a U.S. Attorney
sign off on it,

433
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:53,160
I'm happy to corroborate that,
but I just can't put it

434
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,830
on the death certificate.

435
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:57,810
Okay.

436
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,870
Thank you.

437
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,820
I appreciate your passion.

438
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:15,080
It's not the Feds' usual response,

439
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,020
but Randy is on our side.

440
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:21,020
When my supervisor sees his report,

441
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:23,190
he's gonna want me back in Vegas.

442
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:26,330
Not that... I'm much help
or anything, but...

443
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,900
...I'm all you've got.

444
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,880
Yeah.

445
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:51,350
So you never met him.

446
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,920
No.

447
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,860
And she never talked about him?

448
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:56,890
Not to me.

449
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:59,190
So why would you let your daughter stay

450
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:02,160
with a guy you've never met
whose name you don't even know?

451
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,800
She was an adult.

452
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,100
Barely.

453
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:07,810
Oh.

454
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,300
I'm sorry. What does that mean?

455
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,270
It ain't good.

456
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:14,410
Ah. Um, look...

457
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:18,150
I don't mean to offend you.

458
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:23,150
I am just trying to understand
the dynamic here, Mr. Hanson.

459
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:24,490
I'm trying to help.

460
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,920
Why is it whenever you people try to help,

461
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,260
it starts with insults?

462
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:32,160
I don't know why she didn't tell me,

463
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:36,010
but she was 18, and I chose to trust her.

464
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,900
I chose wrong.

465
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:41,470
Okay, well, um, how about... your wife?

466
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,140
Did your daughter talk to her?

467
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:44,470
Do you talk to your mother?

468
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:47,110
Her name is Annie? Is she here?

469
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,440
She's in the bedroom.

470
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,210
Good. I'd like to speak to her.

471
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,810
Be my guest.

472
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,320
Thank you.

473
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:55,890
- Bedroom's just this way?
- That way.

474
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:01,060
- Jane?
- Yeah.

475
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:02,990
You don't mind, right?

476
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,790
Hey, you don't need my permission.

477
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:07,200
You're an adult.

478
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:10,270
Barely.

479
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,020
Jane?

480
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,780
I'm-I'm really sorry.

481
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:16,870
Hey.

482
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:59,570
I'd like to tell you it gets easier.

483
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:03,250
It doesn't.

484
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,120
If there's any...

485
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:12,120
comfort, it's...

486
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,000
getting used to the pain, I suppose.

487
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,530
Went to a grief seminar in Casper.

488
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,470
Did you know that?

489
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,040
I don't know why.

490
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:36,690
Just wanted the bad to go away.

491
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:40,250
Wanted answers... to questions
that couldn't be answered.

492
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:46,220
The counselor come up to me
after the seminar

493
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:50,160
and sat down next to me.

494
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:52,890
And he said something that stuck with me.

495
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:57,270
I don't know if it's what he said,

496
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,670
or it's how he said it.

497
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:08,940
He says, «I got some good news,
and I got some bad news.»

498
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,980
«Bad news is you're never
gonna be the same.»

499
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:15,960
«You're never gonna be whole,
not ever again.»

500
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:18,690
«Your lost your daughter.»

501
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,990
«Nothing's ever going to replace that.»

502
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,990
«Now the good news is,»

503
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:27,000
«as soon as you accept that,
and you let yourself suffer...»

504
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:37,070
«...you allow yourself
to visit her in your mind,»

505
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:40,580
«and you'll remember
all the love she gave,»

506
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:43,650
«all the joy she knew.»

507
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:51,220
Point is, Martin,
you can't steer from the pain.

508
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,300
If you do, you'll rob yourself...

509
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:05,000
You'll rob yourself
of every memory of her.

510
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,150
Every last one.

511
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:10,470
From her first step

512
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:13,110
to her last smile.

513
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,610
Kill 'em all.

514
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:20,320
Just take the pain, Martin.

515
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:22,650
You hear me?

516
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:25,230
You take it.

517
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:31,630
It's the only way
you'll keep her with you.

518
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,340
I'm just tired, Cory.

519
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:40,370
You know, I just...

520
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,770
I'm so tired of fighting this life.

521
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,550
What you do now is for your boy.

522
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,740
Humm.

523
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:53,080
Drugs is his family now.

524
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,220
He's gone, too.

525
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:59,320
Lives right down the damn road,
but he's...

526
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,600
he's gone.

527
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:06,060
I expect they'll find out
he's involved in this somehow.

528
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,830
He's staying with the Littlefeather boys.

529
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:13,540
Is that it?

530
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:15,400
Yeah.

531
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,240
You're driving this Fed around
so she don't

532
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:20,240
get lost? Is that it?

533
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,150
That's what they asked me to do.

534
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:26,250
It's not what I'm doing.

535
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:32,330
Then what are you doing?

536
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:36,360
I'm a hunter, Martin.

537
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:39,530
What do you think I'm doing?

538
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:48,640
If you find out who did this,

539
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:52,170
I don't care who it is.

540
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,110
You understand me?

541
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:57,290
Right where they stand.

542
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,720
Then get off my porch and go do it.

543
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,890
Natalie's brother

544
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,830
lives here with Stan
and Bart Littlefeather

545
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:51,600
and a real piece of work
named Frank Walker.

546
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,710
Hanson kid's bad,
but the others are just...

547
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,740
stone evil, so watch yourself.

548
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:01,880
Shouldn't we just maybe wait
for some backup?

549
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:05,210
Well... this isn't the land
of backup, Jane.

550
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,280
This is a land of you're on your own.

551
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,590
<i>♫ Put my city up on my back ♫</i>

552
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:17,190
<i>♫ Pushing whips you wish you had ♫</i>

553
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:19,930
<i>♫ Get money till I can't no more... ♫</i>

554
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:26,900
<i>♫ And if it's gotta be death or jail... ♫</i>

555
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,670
Listen to that shit.

556
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:37,410
Yeah?

557
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:39,550
Yeah, we're looking
for Chip Hanson. He around?

558
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,780
Not here, bro.

559
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,750
Who are you?

560
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,620
Who the fuck are you?

561
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,460
I'm the FBI.

562
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:50,860
Are you Sam?

563
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:52,730
No.

564
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,460
You high right now, Sam?

565
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,900
How many times have I arrested you?

566
00:38:57,930 --> 00:39:01,240
Chief. What's up, bro?

567
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:02,600
Where's your brother?

568
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:06,580
He's in prison where you put him.

569
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,240
What? No parole?

570
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,680
Well, look at that...
the justice system at work.

571
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:13,580
That reminds me.

572
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,920
My P.O. told me to give you something.

573
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:18,620
I... I got it... I got it
right here. Let's see...

574
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:20,990
Wait. Let me see your hands. Let me see...

575
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,730
Cory! Watch the back!

576
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:40,530
The other two's outside
with Cory. Let's go.

577
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,000
He's-he's still alive.
We need to call the EMS.

578
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:46,740
EMS is an hour away. Just... just

579
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:48,070
- leave him.
- Mm-mm.

580
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,040
He's not dead, Ben.

581
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:00,750
Like I said,

582
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,820
let's go.

583
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:17,500
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

584
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:20,900
The skinny one's Natalie's brother.

585
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:23,470
- Who's the other one?
- That...

586
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:25,510
is a Frank Walker.

587
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,510
Won't your daddy be proud?

588
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:30,040
My dad's in prison, asshole.

589
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,850
I know. I put him there.

590
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,150
Tell me what happened
to your sister, Chip.

591
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:36,020
What?

592
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:37,850
Don't play dumb.

593
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:40,050
About what? What happened to her?

594
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:44,770
Huh?

595
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:46,900
What'd that cracker do, huh?

596
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:49,530
What... what cracker?

597
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:51,980
Was she seeing a white guy?

598
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,140
Do you know him? Do you know who he is?

599
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:56,740
Do you know his name, Chip?

600
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:00,680
You just said «was.»

601
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:03,810
Why did you say «was»?

602
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:06,980
Wh-Why did she say «was»?

603
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:09,120
She just said «was»!

604
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:12,060
Because I found her raped and killed

605
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:15,490
right over there, son.

606
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:17,240
That's why.

607
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,200
No.

608
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:29,800
What?!

609
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:38,260
What...?!

610
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:43,790
You go. I'm gonna get Chip over to Lander

611
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:46,290
and see if he'll give me
the name of this boyfriend.

612
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,290
I'm telling you, this is how we find him.

613
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,730
No, we go to where
he works or where he lives.

614
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,290
Yeah?

615
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:54,030
All right, well, where does he work?

616
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:56,030
Where does he live?

617
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:59,310
You think this asshole's gonna
tell us anything? I don't.

618
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:01,800
Look, I know you're looking for clues,

619
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,300
but you're missing all the signs.

620
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:05,170
Come here. Let me show you.

621
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:09,010
See this here?

622
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,950
- This is a sled track, right?
- Okay.

623
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:14,050
Okay, you see out here on the ridge?

624
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,750
Here.

625
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:17,860
Use these.

626
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:21,020
- Okay.
- You see at the end of the ridge here?

627
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:22,890
Follow my hand. Can you see my hand?

628
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:26,770
- Yep.
- Okay, when I take it away, now look.

629
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,000
- Do you see that?
- Uh-huh.

630
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:30,970
- Can you see the shadow there?
- I think so.

631
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,300
The snow's starting to cover it.

632
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:34,150
Now look up at the base
of the mountain there...

633
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,630
you see it go up the ridge there?

634
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:37,020
You'll see it a lot easier there.

635
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,910
You see those tracks go
up that mountain there?

636
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:41,310
- Yeah, I see it.
- All right.

637
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:44,750
Natalie's body was found
just past there. Right?

638
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:48,750
And someone unloaded a sled right here,

639
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:51,090
drove all the way out there.

640
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:54,790
There's no tracks coming back...
why is that?

641
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:58,030
I'm telling you...
the answers are out there.

642
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,800
Hey, look, um...

643
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:08,680
I don't know how to do this, okay?

644
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:11,110
- I'm not a tracker.
- That's okay.

645
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:13,170
That's all I do.

646
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:16,680
Look...

647
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:19,280
- you asked me to help you, right?
- Yeah.

648
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:21,620
We should go, while I still can.

649
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:24,850
Okay.

650
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:46,880
Why are we stopping?

651
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,080
Well, we're above the storm now.

652
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:52,080
The trees are too thick to drive.

653
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:54,880
Got to walk from here.

654
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,820
Come on.

655
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:03,390
- Put these on.
- Okay.

656
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:11,070
Now what?

657
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:13,740
We walk.

658
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:15,900
Follow these sled tracks heading south.

659
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,240
- Ready?
- Yeah.

660
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:19,310
- All right, follow me.
- Mm. Okay.

661
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:49,400
Oh, my God.

662
00:46:58,050 --> 00:47:00,150
Oh, my God.

663
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,110
We were on foot the last half mile of it,

664
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:24,910
but we blazed a pretty good
trail in the snow, so...

665
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:27,480
I could take the boys
back up there if you want.

666
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:30,110
Well, I'll talk to the BIA supervisor.

667
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:32,990
He just might want you to do that.

668
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,740
Security team over at the rig's got cameras

669
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:35,790
around the perimeter.

670
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,470
I'm gonna head up there in the morning...

671
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,350
we might get lucky
and find something on tape.

672
00:47:39,350 --> 00:47:40,820
All right.

673
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:45,090
Did... did the two we have
in custody say anything?

674
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:47,860
They ain't the talking kind, Jane.

675
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:49,860
These kids, they expect to go to prison.

676
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,370
It's a rite of passage.

677
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,800
Hell, I think they look forward
to it... you know, uh,

678
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:57,070
three hots and a cot and free cable.

679
00:47:57,110 --> 00:48:00,210
Anything's better than being
here, the way they see it.

680
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,780
Let's just test their DNA
against the semen

681
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:04,510
and see what that tells us.

682
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:06,510
- Can I talk to them?
- No, Cory.

683
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,880
Anything they tell you
would be inadmissible in court.

684
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,420
And then anything you'd tell us

685
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:13,190
would render every net result
inadmissible as well.

686
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:14,520
What if I didn't tell you?

687
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,290
What if I just knew it?

688
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,930
Yeah. Agent Banner.

689
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,400
Yes, sir.

690
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:24,530
Ben.

691
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:29,000
I've known this kid since he could walk.

692
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,910
I gotta canvass the house.

693
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:34,280
The, uh, back door only locks
from the inside.

694
00:48:55,930 --> 00:48:57,970
Look at you.

695
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:01,440
Look at you.

696
00:49:01,470 --> 00:49:03,600
I didn't do shit.

697
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:09,280
All you've been doing is shit
for the last few years, Chip.

698
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:12,290
It's this place, man.

699
00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:14,580
Look what it takes from us.

700
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:17,090
What it took from you.

701
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:20,290
I'm not gonna stand here
and tell you that life's fair,

702
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,620
'cause it ain't.

703
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:23,190
To either of us.

704
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:25,440
But, you know,

705
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:28,300
what do we do?

706
00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:30,130
This land, land,

707
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:32,880
- this land is all we got left.
- What's this «we» shit?

708
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:34,640
Only thing native about you
is your ex-wife,

709
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:36,200
and the daughter you couldn't protect.

710
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,940
Maybe if you'd played detective...

711
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:44,010
That's not something
you get to talk about.

712
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:46,310
You hear me?

713
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:48,650
Go over there.

714
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:57,130
You're gonna lecture me
about protecting people

715
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,030
while you deal the shit
that's killing them?

716
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:05,030
Unlike most people, you had every chance

717
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:07,240
to get the hell out of here
if that's what you want.

718
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:08,690
You had the army, you had college...

719
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:09,960
whatever, it was your choice.

720
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,870
Look what you chose.

721
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:14,510
Look what you chose.

722
00:50:15,510 --> 00:50:17,510
Goddamn you.

723
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:21,320
I met him.

724
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:26,120
Yeah?

725
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,300
Yeah, the motherfucker
was almost as old as you.

726
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,320
All right?

727
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,560
I wanted to fight his ass, too.

728
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:36,540
But Natalie wouldn't let me.

729
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:40,040
Guess love really is blind, huh?

730
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:46,280
He works security
on one of them drill sites.

731
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:51,650
Does the boyfriend have a name?

732
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,120
Matt. Matt something.

733
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:55,280
I don't know.

734
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,990
Who does?

735
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:58,950
Sam knew.

736
00:50:58,990 --> 00:51:01,360
Why don't you ask him?

737
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:04,290
I think you'll be talking
to Sam long before I do.

738
00:51:04,330 --> 00:51:08,460
You think this is who I wanted to be?

739
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:11,930
Man...

740
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:15,200
I get so mad,

741
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,570
I want to fight the whole world.

742
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:23,240
You got any idea what that feels like?

743
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:26,050
I do.

744
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:31,090
But I decided to fight
the feeling instead.

745
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:35,360
'Cause I figured the world would win.

746
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,530
What did I tell you?

747
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,470
Did-did he say anything?

748
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:46,730
No, fuck, I don't... I don't...
I don't want to know.

749
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:49,320
You're headed up to the rigs tomorrow,
ain'tcha? [Aren't you?]

750
00:51:49,350 --> 00:51:50,170
Yeah.

751
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:53,350
Natalie's boyfriend worked there.

752
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:54,750
What?

753
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:57,550
No. Fuck, don't tell me.

754
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:59,750
This thing's solving itself.

755
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:01,280
Cory.

756
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:04,020
I want you at the rig with us tomorrow.

757
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:08,360
You don't catch wolves
looking where they might be,

758
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:10,790
you look where they've been.

759
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:13,270
They been right here.

760
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,510
Hey.

761
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:32,460
You okay?

762
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,350
I been better.

763
00:52:38,350 --> 00:52:41,490
Brings it all back, doesn't it?

764
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:45,560
Maybe.

765
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:48,430
So, you and Ben and this little FBI girl

766
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:51,470
formed your own posse
to go solve it all, I hear.

767
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:55,500
Just trying to help.

768
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:59,070
You won't get the answers
you're looking for.

769
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,810
No matter what you find.

770
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:07,680
This isn't about Emily.

771
00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:17,130
Good night, Cory.

772
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:49,760
Matt Rayburn.

773
00:53:51,430 --> 00:53:53,460
Do you know him?

774
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,730
That the guy we found in the snow?

775
00:53:56,770 --> 00:53:58,640
Yeah. His fingerprints
are in the database.

776
00:53:58,670 --> 00:54:02,540
He's a security contractor
for one of the drill stations.

777
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,440
All right.

778
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:09,510
That it?

779
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,310
- Am I fired now?
- No.

780
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:14,180
- Come on, why don't you come inside.
- Okay.

781
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:16,480
- We'll warm up.
- Yeah.

782
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,630
You, uh, want something to drink?

783
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:25,830
Sure.

784
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:28,700
Got, uh... milk

785
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:30,760
and coffee and well water.

786
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,300
Water is good.

787
00:54:32,330 --> 00:54:33,800
Okay.

788
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,380
All right, uh,

789
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,440
just make yourself at home.

790
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:00,390
Here you go.

791
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:02,330
Thanks.

792
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:07,640
That's, uh...

793
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:09,600
that's my daughter, Emily.

794
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:13,340
She passed three years ago.

795
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:17,480
I'm sorry.

796
00:55:19,450 --> 00:55:22,680
You want to know how, don't you?

797
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:27,660
I do, but...

798
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:30,260
Makes two of us.

799
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:35,330
I was, uh, working as, uh,
an outfitter in Pinedale,

800
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,230
and there was a big snow.

801
00:55:37,270 --> 00:55:40,900
So I found myself with a rare night off.

802
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:43,580
So I go to a motel, call the wife

803
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:46,580
and say, «Why don't you come up
and stay for the night?»

804
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:48,910
And when you got two... two kids

805
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:51,780
and you're on the mountain
half the year, it's...

806
00:55:51,810 --> 00:55:54,720
you don't get much time together.

807
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:57,990
So we had Emily look after Casey.

808
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:00,390
He was five at the time. She was 16.

809
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:02,920
I guess word got out

810
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,590
that we were out of town.

811
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:07,600
So some school friends came over.

812
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:09,600
Then some more friends.

813
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:12,870
Then, uh...

814
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:15,640
and then some people came over
that weren't friends.

815
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:20,640
So a little gathering turned
into quite the party, I guess.

816
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:23,790
Then, uh...

817
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:26,950
I don't know.

818
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:30,420
You know, there's a lot I don't know.

819
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:37,760
Got that phone call the next morning.

820
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:41,500
From Natalie.

821
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:44,900
Saying that Emily was missing.

822
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,470
She was worried, naturally.

823
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:52,540
They were best friends.

824
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:56,610
You know, we tried to be
very careful with Emily.

825
00:56:57,650 --> 00:57:00,810
Tried to plan for everything.

826
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:08,790
She was such a good girl.

827
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,730
But we let our guard down.

828
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,930
Really, I tell you,

829
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:20,470
you know, you may have kids one day.

830
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:23,470
You cannot blink.

831
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:27,070
Not once, not ever.

832
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:34,450
There was a guy moving sheep
over by the Wind River.

833
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,950
He's the one who found her.

834
00:57:36,990 --> 00:57:40,630
Some 20 miles from our house.

835
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:44,030
They don't know how she got
there or what happened.

836
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:46,030
Autopsy couldn't tell us much,

837
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:50,030
'cause the coyotes got at her pretty good.

838
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:53,630
You know, I'm-I'm sor...

839
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:57,140
I'm sorry, it's not...

840
00:57:57,170 --> 00:57:59,540
I'm sorry.

841
00:57:59,570 --> 00:58:03,040
Could you point me, um...

842
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,650
towards your...

843
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:06,150
uh, the bathroom?

844
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:08,020
Straight back there.

845
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:10,080
Thanks.

846
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:38,880
<i>«There is a meadow in my perfect world...»</i>

847
00:58:38,910 --> 00:58:41,110
Emily wrote that.

848
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:47,120
It's what got her accepted
into the summer writing program

849
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:51,030
at Colorado State.

850
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:53,960
Did she write it to you?

851
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,670
Mm.

852
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:01,000
Doesn't matter who it's to.

853
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:03,750
Just matters who it's from.

854
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:12,080
Look, I'm sorry about, um,

855
00:59:12,110 --> 00:59:13,810
earlier tonight.

856
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:15,680
I guess...

857
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:18,890
I'm just trying to do
the right thing here.

858
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:22,890
And I don't really know what
the Hanson boy told you, but...

859
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:25,890
I don't want to stumble
into something like today

860
00:59:25,930 --> 00:59:27,900
if I can help it.

861
00:59:27,930 --> 00:59:31,700
So, you know, if he said something that...

862
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:35,240
I should know,
I'd appreciate if you shared.

863
00:59:35,270 --> 00:59:37,570
Well, all he said was that.

864
00:59:37,610 --> 00:59:39,640
Natalie's boyfriend was named Matt.

865
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:42,940
And you've already figured out
who that is, so...

866
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:46,850
You could've called
for that information, no?

867
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:49,850
I wanted to know why you're helping me.

868
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:52,590
Now I do, so...

869
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:54,920
Tomorrow...

870
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:58,630
do you think we could not ride
the snowmobiles

871
00:59:58,660 --> 00:59:59,630
80 miles an hour?

872
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:01,530
Yeah, sure.

873
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:03,800
If you want to end up in a
ditch we could've jumped over,

874
01:00:03,830 --> 01:00:05,670
but...

875
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:07,670
Great.

876
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:09,670
Okay.

877
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:12,610
You win.

878
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,010
Have a good night.

879
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:15,510
All right.

880
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:18,710
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

881
01:00:36,770 --> 01:00:38,740
You're shaking more than she is.

882
01:00:38,770 --> 01:00:41,700
It's cold enough to freeze
a well digger's ass out here.

883
01:00:41,740 --> 01:00:43,900
- Yeah. Below zero, I bet.
- Yeah, six below.

884
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:45,810
It's a lot colder up there.

885
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:48,240
Hey, bud.

886
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:49,780
Hey. How are you doing?

887
01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:51,580
What are you doing here?

888
01:00:51,590 --> 01:00:53,600
Those tracks that lead
from the Littlefeather house

889
01:00:53,610 --> 01:00:55,680
to the body, I'm gonna follow
'em, see where they go.

890
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:57,250
- How about you?
- Yeah, well,

891
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:59,100
Jane's the only one
with jurisdiction out there.

892
01:00:59,110 --> 01:01:00,880
Just wanted a few extra badges along.

893
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:02,900
You want to walk 'em through this?

894
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:04,830
Uh, sure, yeah. Um...

895
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:07,090
the drill station has cameras
all along its perimeter,

896
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:09,960
so we're hoping one of
the cameras caught something.

897
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,800
And, uh, we'll also canvass
Matt Rayburn's trailer,

898
01:01:13,810 --> 01:01:16,080
and see if there's anything
that links him to the assault.

899
01:01:16,090 --> 01:01:17,790
Do you have a warrant?

900
01:01:17,870 --> 01:01:19,210
I'm gonna ask real nice.

901
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:22,580
Can't get there
from the Littlefeather house?

902
01:01:22,610 --> 01:01:25,110
Uh, it's a real tough sled ride
through two canyons,

903
01:01:25,150 --> 01:01:27,110
and I ain't looking to dig you out,

904
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:29,020
- so I wouldn't recommend it.
- We'll take

905
01:01:29,050 --> 01:01:30,580
the refinery road around.

906
01:01:30,590 --> 01:01:32,300
See, you got to drive 50 miles to go five.

907
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:33,970
- Yeah.
- Welcome to Wyoming.

908
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:37,770
Didn't you people get the memo
that it's-it's spring?

909
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,930
- Come on, guys.
- If you find anything,

910
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,360
you call me on the radio...

911
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,200
- Sure will.
- ...we'll come up to you.

912
01:03:45,250 --> 01:03:49,690

01:04:42,910 --> 01:04:44,880
Can I help you?

921
01:04:44,910 --> 01:04:48,050
Yeah, does, uh, Matt Rayburn work here?

922
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:50,280
Yeah. Do you know where he is?

923
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:54,020
I was, uh, about to ask you
the same thing.

924
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:57,100
No, he got in a fight with his
girlfriend a couple days ago.

925
01:04:57,130 --> 01:04:58,840
She took off.

926
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:00,550
He took off after.
We haven't seen him since.

927
01:05:00,550 --> 01:05:02,320
- When was that?
- Three days ago.

928
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,160
Hell, we-we didn't know what to do.

929
01:05:04,170 --> 01:05:06,240
We've been waiting on corporate
ever since to tell us

930
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:08,120
whether or not to fill out
his termination papers

931
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:09,640
- or call you guys.
- Everything okay?

932
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:11,540
Yeah, yeah. Here about Matt.

933
01:05:11,550 --> 01:05:13,390
You find him? Is he okay?

934
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:15,410
- What happened to you two?
- What's that?

935
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:17,950
You look a little torn up.

936
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:19,950
Yeah, well, you hit

937
01:05:19,980 --> 01:05:21,460
one of these pine branches doing 60,

938
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:22,560
see what happens to you.

939
01:05:22,570 --> 01:05:24,340
Yeah, we run the
property line twice daily...

940
01:05:24,350 --> 01:05:26,280
comes with the territory.

941
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:28,420
You should try using, uh, face shields.

942
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:30,290
I requested helmets.

943
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:32,160
Our supervisor said,
«Snow's soft, ain't it?»

944
01:05:32,190 --> 01:05:35,060
Corporate's in Texas. What can I tell you?

945
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:36,900
Does Matt bunk here on the property?

946
01:05:36,930 --> 01:05:40,370
Yeah. Yeah, we all do.

947
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:44,070
- Can we see his trailer?
- Yeah, sure.

948
01:05:44,110 --> 01:05:45,480
Come on, I'll walk you up.

949
01:05:45,510 --> 01:05:46,470
What's going on, boss?

950
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:49,240
They're here about Matt.

951
01:06:12,530 --> 01:06:15,500
End of the line for you.

952
01:07:09,490 --> 01:07:11,560
So, did, uh...

953
01:07:11,590 --> 01:07:13,090
did something happen to him?

954
01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:14,630
Do you know where he is?

955
01:07:14,660 --> 01:07:16,930
That's what we're trying to find out.

956
01:07:16,970 --> 01:07:18,710
His girlfriend filed
a Missing Persons Report.

957
01:07:18,730 --> 01:07:20,680
Well, how can that be?
I thought you guys found her

958
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:22,180
in a snowdrift right before the storm.

959
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:23,400
Excuse me?

960
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:25,040
I heard her name go out over the radio

961
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:27,250
- when you guys found her.
- I don't remember

962
01:07:27,260 --> 01:07:28,860
using her name.

963
01:07:30,310 --> 01:07:32,950
Well, maybe you weren't listening.

964
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:36,360
What the fuck are you doing?

965
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:37,480
What?

966
01:07:39,190 --> 01:07:40,390
Why are you flanking me?

967
01:07:40,420 --> 01:07:42,470
- What are you talking about?
- What the fuck

968
01:07:42,490 --> 01:07:45,160
you think I'm talking about?
You got us on three sides...

969
01:07:45,170 --> 01:07:47,310
Get your hand off that weapon.
This is private property.

970
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:48,730
Put the fucking gun down!

971
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:50,470
- Hold it right there!
- Put the fucking gun

972
01:07:50,470 --> 01:07:51,400
- down right now!
- Hey!

973
01:07:51,410 --> 01:07:52,420
Put it down! Do it!

974
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:54,320
- Drop to your knees right now!
- Do it!

975
01:07:54,340 --> 01:07:56,350
Turn away from me!
Drop to your knees right now!

976
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:57,160
Evan!

977
01:07:57,170 --> 01:07:58,960
Fuck you! This is a
Department of Energy lease

978
01:07:58,970 --> 01:08:00,170
on reservation land, asshole!

979
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:01,980
- You're breaking the law by being here!
- Hey!

980
01:08:01,990 --> 01:08:03,690
This is leased land
on a reservation, Deputy!

981
01:08:03,690 --> 01:08:05,730
- You got no authority!
- You think I don't know what

982
01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:08,210
- you're doing?!
- Fucking do it, asshole! See what happens!

983
01:08:08,390 --> 01:08:10,390
Hoka hey, white boy, let's go.
[Sioux : Let's do it!]

984
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:11,500
What are we doing?

985
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:12,780
Deputy, you've got no authority!

986
01:08:12,780 --> 01:08:14,140
You're in violation of federal law!

987
01:08:14,150 --> 01:08:15,720
- Lower your weapon!
- Fuck you!

988
01:08:15,790 --> 01:08:18,260
- You got us in a crossfire!
- Talk to me! What do I do?

989
01:08:18,290 --> 01:08:20,690
Hold your ground! County
sheriffs have no authority!

990
01:08:20,730 --> 01:08:23,330
- All right, everybody, just take it easy!
- FBI! Hey!

991
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:28,170
FBI! This is federal land,
and I am the only authority!

992
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:29,570
Okay?!

993
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:33,670
Right now, all of you stand down!

994
01:08:33,710 --> 01:08:36,480
Okay? Everyone.

995
01:08:36,510 --> 01:08:39,610
We're all working
towards the same goal here,

996
01:08:39,650 --> 01:08:43,150
and I need you to back down

997
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:46,490
and take your hands away
from your weapons.

998
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:48,760
Look.

999
01:08:48,790 --> 01:08:52,190
Dillon, holster your weapon.

1000
01:08:54,260 --> 01:08:56,100
Fucking decaf, man.

1001
01:08:56,130 --> 01:08:57,660
Jesus fucking Christ.

1002
01:08:57,700 --> 01:09:01,500
You keep these assholes in check, lady.

1003
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:03,010
We're just doing our fucking job here.

1004
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:03,990
Yeah, when we show up,

1005
01:09:04,170 --> 01:09:06,110
- your job is over, asshole.
- Evan!

1006
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:07,510
Holster your weapon, now!

1007
01:09:07,540 --> 01:09:09,510
All right. Every one of you
step to my left.

1008
01:09:09,540 --> 01:09:12,280
- Let's go.
- Nobody behind me. Do you understand?

1009
01:09:12,310 --> 01:09:14,380
- You got it, asshole. Guys...
- Yeah.

1010
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:16,090
...step my way!

1011
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:18,590
Everybody take a big,
deep breath here, please.

1012
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:21,620
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Relax.
- Deputy,

1013
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:23,700
- holster your weapon.
- You didn't see it?

1014
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:26,090
Now, or you're under arrest.
Do you understand me?

1015
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:29,540
You didn't see it.

1016
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:47,090
Take us to Matt's trailer.

1017
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:49,160
Yes, ma'am.

1018
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:10,240
Ben, you copy?

1019
01:10:13,470 --> 01:10:15,610
Ben, do you copy?

1020
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:29,270
Ben.

1021
01:10:34,830 --> 01:10:37,860
This is it, right here.

1022
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:40,330
Does he bunk with anybody?

1023
01:10:40,370 --> 01:10:43,400
Yeah. Me and Pete Mickens.

1024
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:44,800
Is Pete in there now?

1025
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:46,670
Yeah. He's sleeping.

1026
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:48,680
He's got the night shift.

1027
01:11:22,610 --> 01:11:24,580
Can I help you?

1028
01:11:24,610 --> 01:11:28,580
Uh, yeah, I'm... I'm looking
for my knight in shining armor.

1029
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:30,950
I think this is his trailer.

1030
01:11:30,980 --> 01:11:32,550
Well, um...

1031
01:11:32,590 --> 01:11:34,820
Shit. I'm a little short
on armor, you know?

1032
01:11:34,860 --> 01:11:36,700
Um, I don't mind.

1033
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:38,390
- You don't mind? Yeah?
- Uh-uh.

1034
01:11:38,430 --> 01:11:42,300
Do you have any idea
how good it is to see you?

1035
01:11:42,330 --> 01:11:44,900
Like, any idea? Man, oh, man.

1036
01:11:44,930 --> 01:11:47,530
How did you get here? I didn't
hear your carriage pull up.

1037
01:11:47,570 --> 01:11:49,240
Well, my, uh...

1038
01:11:49,270 --> 01:11:51,570
carriage wanted to catch
the 8:00 show in Lander...

1039
01:11:51,610 --> 01:11:53,750
...so she dropped me off at the turnout.

1040
01:11:53,770 --> 01:11:55,650
What'd you do?
You just walked in the snow, huh?

1041
01:11:55,650 --> 01:11:56,450
Mm-hmm.

1042
01:11:56,460 --> 01:11:58,440
- Like Superwoman.
- Well, I think you're worth it.

1043
01:11:58,450 --> 01:12:00,310
- You think I'm worth it? Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

1044
01:12:00,350 --> 01:12:02,220
Would you get your ass in here?

1045
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:04,650
You're, like, baddest woman
on the planet, you know that?

1046
01:12:07,660 --> 01:12:10,200
Goddamn.

1047
01:12:11,830 --> 01:12:13,840
- How about New York?
- Oh!

1048
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:15,560
You'd hate New York.

1049
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,700
You'd hate it. You go a whole month there,

1050
01:12:17,730 --> 01:12:20,870
your... your feet never touch
anything but cement.

1051
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:22,700
Okay, how about Chicago?

1052
01:12:22,740 --> 01:12:25,410
Hmm, shit. Baby, it's the
same thing as New York.

1053
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:27,910
- It's just colder, you know? More crime.
- Mmm.

1054
01:12:27,940 --> 01:12:29,920
If you're into that kind of thing.

1055
01:12:29,940 --> 01:12:33,410
You think that's funny? Yeah?

1056
01:12:33,450 --> 01:12:35,820
All right, how about Los Angeles, hmm?

1057
01:12:35,850 --> 01:12:37,350
Hey, listen to me.

1058
01:12:37,370 --> 01:12:39,140
Do never, ever say that word
around me again.

1059
01:12:39,150 --> 01:12:40,150
Oh. What? It's warm there.

1060
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:41,660
Yeah, I'd rather be in Iraq.

1061
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:43,330
Iraq's warm.

1062
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:44,860
Mm.

1063
01:12:44,890 --> 01:12:46,890
And I'll tell you what. I got one.

1064
01:12:46,930 --> 01:12:49,330
- Mm-hmm.
- I got one.

1065
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:52,830
I was, uh... I remember I was stationed

1066
01:12:52,850 --> 01:12:54,550
up at this place called Point Mugu, right?

1067
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:55,360
Mm-hmm.

1068
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:57,330
It's about an hour north
of L.A. It was Christmas.

1069
01:12:57,340 --> 01:12:58,480
I woke up, I'm all alone.

1070
01:12:58,540 --> 01:12:59,910
You know, I don't have anybody,

1071
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:01,640
and what the Navy does at Christmastime

1072
01:13:01,650 --> 01:13:03,760
is they have these dumb
little skits in the mess hall,

1073
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:05,460
you know, for the guys without families.

1074
01:13:05,470 --> 01:13:07,370
And I wasn't gonna stick around
for that bullshit,

1075
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:08,680
so I just... I got in my truck,

1076
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:10,480
and I hightailed it out of there,

1077
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:13,620
and I wound up in this little
mountain town called Ojai.

1078
01:13:13,650 --> 01:13:16,320
And I get there, and it's like...

1079
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:18,660
it's, like, fruit farms and vineyards,

1080
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:20,610
and there's this mountain
surrounding it, you know,

1081
01:13:20,610 --> 01:13:21,780
like, protecting the town.

1082
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:23,530
And the people there are, like...

1083
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:25,870
- Everybody smiles at each other, you know?
- Yeah?

1084
01:13:25,900 --> 01:13:28,500
And they say hello, and it's, like...

1085
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:30,740
I remember thinking
that they were all, like...

1086
01:13:30,770 --> 01:13:33,340
I don't know. They had
these looks in their eyes.

1087
01:13:33,370 --> 01:13:35,050
Like they were in
on some sort of a secret,

1088
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:37,390
like they had all figured it out.

1089
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:39,070
There's this mission, this Spanish mission

1090
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:40,450
right there in the middle of town.

1091
01:13:40,510 --> 01:13:42,010
They're having Christmas Mass.

1092
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:43,780
They're celebrating Christmas

1093
01:13:43,820 --> 01:13:46,020
in 70-degree weather,
you know, and I just went,

1094
01:13:46,050 --> 01:13:48,020
and I picked me up an orange off a tree,

1095
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:50,100
and sat down on a bench and listened

1096
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:53,030
to that choir sing,
eating my orange, you know.

1097
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:55,900
It was... I don't know.

1098
01:13:55,930 --> 01:13:58,470
It was the best Christmas I ever had.

1099
01:14:01,130 --> 01:14:03,700
I want to live there.

1100
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:07,340
Okay.

1101
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:10,620
- Let's live in Ojai.
- Okay.

1102
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:11,940
- Yeah?
- Mmm.

1103
01:14:17,550 --> 01:14:20,750
What time is it?

1104
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:23,090
I thought they were staying
in town tonight.

1105
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:24,820
I did, too.

1106
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:27,360
Shit. I'm sorry, Nat.

1107
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:31,430
Just shut the, uh...

1108
01:14:35,870 --> 01:14:39,370
Shot! Shot! Shot! Shot!

1109
01:14:39,410 --> 01:14:41,940
- SHOT! SHOT! SHOT!
- Yo. What do we got? You got...

1110
01:14:41,980 --> 01:14:43,790
You got drinks? You got... you got vodka?

1111
01:14:43,810 --> 01:14:45,980
- Whoa, hey.
- You got... What do you got?

1112
01:14:46,010 --> 01:14:48,000
Get me... get me a beer. Get me a beer.

1113
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:49,860
- Fucking take one!
- You want... you want one?

1114
01:14:53,450 --> 01:14:55,120
- Man, you want one?
- Yo...

1115
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:56,930
Smells like sex in here.

1116
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:03,460
- What you two been doing?
- Well, well, well.

1117
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:05,630
What do you got,
the fucking honeymoon suite?

1118
01:15:05,670 --> 01:15:08,070
What you two been doing, huh?

1119
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:10,500
What have they been doing?

1120
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:13,110
Hmm!

1121
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:15,110
Well, hello there.

1122
01:15:15,140 --> 01:15:16,810
Hi, Pete.

1123
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:20,480
Hello. You know, I'm...
just kind of wondering

1124
01:15:20,490 --> 01:15:22,200
what you got on under
them big sheets there.

1125
01:15:22,210 --> 01:15:24,240
Hey, Curt, you mind getting him, man?

1126
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:26,130
- Come on. Pete.
- I asked the lady a question.

1127
01:15:26,150 --> 01:15:28,100
- Pete.
- What does she got underneath them sheets?

1128
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:30,890
It's a fluffy down coat, Pete.
It's not very sexy.

1129
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:32,530
Well, fluffy sounds good to me.

1130
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:34,710
- Hey, Curt, you gonna get him or not, man?
- Matty.

1131
01:15:34,730 --> 01:15:36,060
Wait a second. Are you naked, too?

1132
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:37,630
Are you... are you naked, too?

1133
01:15:37,670 --> 01:15:39,310
- What have you two been doing?!
- Come on!

1134
01:15:39,310 --> 01:15:40,110
Are you naked?

1135
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:42,240
Hey, Curt, you mind getting him
out of my room, please?

1136
01:15:42,250 --> 01:15:44,090
- Come on, Pete. Let's go!
- Are you naked, too?

1137
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:45,770
- What have you two been doing?
- Hey, Curt,

1138
01:15:45,770 --> 01:15:47,660
- could you get him, man?
- Huh?
- Pete, come on!

1139
01:15:47,670 --> 01:15:49,500
I'll tell you what.
I just want one little peek.

1140
01:15:49,510 --> 01:15:51,880
I just want one little... just a little...
just a little peek.

1141
01:15:51,890 --> 01:15:54,400
Hey, Curt, why don't you come in here
and and get him out of here?

1142
01:15:54,410 --> 01:15:56,240
I don't understand why you don't do that,
man.

1143
01:15:56,250 --> 01:15:58,250
- Come on!
- Just a little pek. Just a little peek.

1144
01:15:58,260 --> 01:15:59,800
- Hey!
- What the fuck is your problem?

1145
01:15:59,810 --> 01:16:00,610
- Hey!
- Oh, ho!

1146
01:16:00,620 --> 01:16:02,360
Bros, whoa, whoa, whoa,
he turned all serious

1147
01:16:02,370 --> 01:16:03,970
all of a sudden. Why are you doing that?

1148
01:16:03,980 --> 01:16:06,120
- Come on. Pete.
- Huh? Now don't you be

1149
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:08,440
bullshitting me, girl.
You'ven been showing your little ass

1150
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:10,210
like a flag around here.

1151
01:16:10,230 --> 01:16:12,570
And I've been seeing it,
and all I want is a little...

1152
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:14,550
All I want is a little peek.

1153
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:15,940
What are you gonna do, big boy?

1154
01:16:17,670 --> 01:16:19,110
What are you gonna do? Come on.

1155
01:16:19,110 --> 01:16:21,360
- What are you gonna do, big boy?
- Pete. Sit down, Pete.

1156
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:23,660
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1157
01:16:23,740 --> 01:16:25,950
- Hey.
- The fuck's that about?

1158
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:27,530
Fucking chill.

1159
01:16:27,530 --> 01:16:29,280
- Oh, yeah, I see that.
- Pete, have a seat.

1160
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:31,120
- He don't want to share.
- I don't understand.

1161
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:32,360
Man doesn't want to be friends.

1162
01:16:32,370 --> 01:16:34,170
You know what? You know what?
We ain't friends.

1163
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:35,610
Friends share.

1164
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:37,890
- Hey!
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1165
01:16:37,930 --> 01:16:39,870
- Aah!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1166
01:16:39,890 --> 01:16:42,500
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What the fuck!

1167
01:16:42,530 --> 01:16:44,900
Being such a fucking pussy
over this prairie nigger.

1168
01:16:44,930 --> 01:16:45,950
Hey!

1169
01:16:45,970 --> 01:16:47,100
- Stop!
- Hey, hey!

1170
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:52,140
Pete!

1171
01:16:52,170 --> 01:16:54,040
Hey! Hey!

1172
01:16:55,780 --> 01:16:59,010
Matty!

1173
01:17:01,310 --> 01:17:02,880
Get him off him!

1174
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:04,690
- Get the fuck off!
- Matty, get the fuck off!

1175
01:17:04,690 --> 01:17:06,230
Don't fucking turn...

1176
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:10,220
Hey, guys.

1177
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:11,960
Hey. Come on.

1178
01:17:13,860 --> 01:17:16,160
Jesus. Aah!

1179
01:17:25,710 --> 01:17:27,010
Get the fuck off!

1180
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:30,290
Hold him!

1181
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:41,150
He hit my head good.

1182
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:04,820
You ain't too proud now, are you, bitch?

1183
01:18:06,780 --> 01:18:08,660
- Huh?
- Next one's my turn, you fucking bitch.

1184
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:11,820
Dude.

1185
01:18:11,850 --> 01:18:13,250
Oh, God!

1186
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:21,740
Get his arm.

1187
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:23,240
Grab his arm. Pull... pull him off.

1188
01:18:23,260 --> 01:18:26,230
Pull. Get his arm.

1189
01:18:28,340 --> 01:18:32,210
Arm. Grab his arm!

1190
01:18:41,350 --> 01:18:43,920
FBI! Open up!

1191
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:57,330
Are you sure someone's in there?

1192
01:18:57,360 --> 01:19:00,330
Hey, Pete, it's Curtis.

1193
01:19:00,370 --> 01:19:03,000
<i>Ben, you copy?</i>

1194
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:05,770
FBI is standing in front
of the door. Open up!

1195
01:19:06,910 --> 01:19:09,010
Jane!

1196
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:10,380
Get away from the door!

1197
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:24,190
Aah!

1198
01:20:06,370 --> 01:20:09,400
Fuck you. Let's go.

1199
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:20,480
Pete, you okay?

1200
01:20:20,510 --> 01:20:22,080
- I'm hit!
- Who isn't?

1201
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:24,190
- Pete, you good?
- We're good!

1202
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:25,720
How many we got down?

1203
01:20:25,750 --> 01:20:27,190
Two that won't get up.

1204
01:20:27,220 --> 01:20:29,460
No. I'm getting up.

1205
01:20:35,330 --> 01:20:39,370
Goddamn it, the women out here are spunky.

1206
01:20:47,070 --> 01:20:50,280
Anyone see where that came from?

1207
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:55,980
- Can you stand?
- I don't know.

1208
01:20:56,020 --> 01:20:59,120
Well, you better figure it out
'cause we're not done yet.

1209
01:21:04,220 --> 01:21:06,090
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

1210
01:21:06,130 --> 01:21:08,060
Curtis?

1211
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:10,170
Mike!

1212
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:12,030
Hey, Curtis!

1213
01:21:12,070 --> 01:21:14,810
Behind trailer three!

1214
01:21:21,310 --> 01:21:23,840
Aah!

1215
01:21:59,980 --> 01:22:03,320
- You okay?
- Mm. Mm.

1216
01:22:03,350 --> 01:22:04,980
Let's get you inside.

1217
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:18,060
Mind if I have a look?

1218
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:21,130
I...

1219
01:22:21,170 --> 01:22:22,870
It's...

1220
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:25,400
I see a couple rounds went through here.

1221
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:27,240
It's just pieces. You should be okay.

1222
01:22:27,270 --> 01:22:29,180
There. Let's see.

1223
01:22:29,210 --> 01:22:31,440
Let's see here.

1224
01:22:33,910 --> 01:22:35,250
Okay.

1225
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:49,110
Yeah, hold that. Press it tight.

1226
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:50,430
- Uh, yeah.
- Okay.

1227
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:52,400
Okay.

1228
01:22:58,140 --> 01:22:59,870
Okay.

1229
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:07,350
Give...

1230
01:23:07,380 --> 01:23:09,880
Give me your radio.

1231
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:11,580
My best chance out of here...

1232
01:23:13,150 --> 01:23:15,190
...is a helicopter.

1233
01:23:15,220 --> 01:23:17,190
You don't have one of those, do you?

1234
01:23:17,220 --> 01:23:20,890
- Nope.
- Hey.

1235
01:23:22,060 --> 01:23:25,400
Hey, give me your radio.

1236
01:23:25,430 --> 01:23:27,600
Go get him.

1237
01:23:27,630 --> 01:23:31,040
I won't bring him back.

1238
01:23:31,070 --> 01:23:33,040
You have to know that.

1239
01:23:33,070 --> 01:23:35,610
I do.

1240
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:38,340
Go get him.

1241
01:23:46,190 --> 01:23:47,490
Whoa.

1242
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:57,360
Come on! Come on!

1243
01:25:19,580 --> 01:25:21,080
You know where you are?

1244
01:25:21,110 --> 01:25:22,510
No.

1245
01:25:22,550 --> 01:25:24,320
It's Gannett Peak.

1246
01:25:25,750 --> 01:25:27,490
Highest mountain in Wyoming.

1247
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:30,490
And on the hottest day in August,

1248
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:33,030
shovel a foot of snow.

1249
01:25:33,060 --> 01:25:35,260
Today...

1250
01:25:35,300 --> 01:25:37,110
too cold to snow.

1251
01:25:37,130 --> 01:25:38,630
Look, man, let's just...

1252
01:25:38,770 --> 01:25:40,410
let's just talk for a minute, all right?

1253
01:25:40,530 --> 01:25:43,370
Let's just... talk. Please.

1254
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:44,740
Sure.

1255
01:25:57,780 --> 01:26:01,120
What the fuck?! Where are my boots?!

1256
01:26:01,150 --> 01:26:03,290
- Where are my boots?!
- You know, I got all

1257
01:26:03,320 --> 01:26:04,760
the time in the world here.

1258
01:26:04,790 --> 01:26:07,090
Can't say the same for you.

1259
01:26:07,130 --> 01:26:10,130
So we gonna talk,
or you gonna keep whining?

1260
01:26:11,860 --> 01:26:13,570
Look, I'm...

1261
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:16,200
I have made mistakes, okay?

1262
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:18,840
So what'd you do?

1263
01:26:18,870 --> 01:26:22,310
Um...

1264
01:26:22,340 --> 01:26:24,640
Hey, look, I'm... I'm not the law here.

1265
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:27,650
I'm just a guy sitting in front of you.

1266
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:30,220
So you can tell me the truth.

1267
01:26:30,250 --> 01:26:32,680
If you tell me the truth,
I'll give you a chance.

1268
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:34,190
Ah, you just listen to me!

1269
01:26:34,220 --> 01:26:35,590
You know what it's like

1270
01:26:35,620 --> 01:26:38,190
out here in this frozen hell?

1271
01:26:39,730 --> 01:26:42,690
There's no nothing to do. No nothing.

1272
01:26:42,730 --> 01:26:46,370
Ain't no women, no fun!

1273
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:48,570
Just this fucking... this fucking snow

1274
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:50,440
and the fucking silence.

1275
01:26:50,470 --> 01:26:52,340
That's all!

1276
01:26:52,370 --> 01:26:55,310
My family's people were forced here,

1277
01:26:55,340 --> 01:26:57,480
stuck here for a century.

1278
01:26:57,510 --> 01:26:59,750
That snow and silence...

1279
01:26:59,780 --> 01:27:02,310
it's the only thing that hasn't
been taken from them.

1280
01:27:04,850 --> 01:27:06,820
- So what'd you take?
- I don't know.

1281
01:27:06,850 --> 01:27:08,750
I don't know. I don't know what you...

1282
01:27:08,790 --> 01:27:10,420
I don't know what you mean.

1283
01:27:10,460 --> 01:27:12,590
You take something, too?

1284
01:27:12,630 --> 01:27:14,670
No.

1285
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:18,570
- Nothing.
- Ah.

1286
01:27:26,910 --> 01:27:28,710
Hey.

1287
01:27:28,740 --> 01:27:30,680
I need you to be honest with me.

1288
01:27:30,710 --> 01:27:32,680
Right?

1289
01:27:33,850 --> 01:27:36,420
You get drunk?

1290
01:27:36,450 --> 01:27:38,350
Get lonely?

1291
01:27:38,390 --> 01:27:40,860
Then what'd you get?

1292
01:27:40,890 --> 01:27:44,390
If you did it, just be a man and say it.

1293
01:27:44,420 --> 01:27:46,360
Say, «I raped her».

1294
01:27:46,390 --> 01:27:48,530
I raped her.

1295
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:50,830
I raped her! Yeah!

1296
01:28:01,540 --> 01:28:03,610
And the boyfriend?

1297
01:28:03,640 --> 01:28:05,440
What, did he get in your way?

1298
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:06,880
Did you beat him to death?

1299
01:28:06,910 --> 01:28:09,850
Look, a nod's not gonna cut it, okay?

1300
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:11,650
- Need you to say it.
- We beat him.

1301
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:14,220
We made him dead.

1302
01:28:16,220 --> 01:28:18,260
Okay.

1303
01:28:26,270 --> 01:28:28,900
Please don't.

1304
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:32,300
I'm gonna cut you loose.

1305
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:35,870
It's okay.

1306
01:28:37,580 --> 01:28:39,950
Free to go.

1307
01:28:42,750 --> 01:28:44,580
Where?! Where am I gonna go?!

1308
01:28:44,620 --> 01:28:46,290
I'm a man of my word.

1309
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:49,920
You told the truth.

1310
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:52,620
I'm gonna give you a chance.

1311
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:54,830
I'm gonna give you the same chance

1312
01:28:54,860 --> 01:28:56,700
that she got.

1313
01:28:56,730 --> 01:28:58,400
What... what chance did she get?

1314
01:28:58,430 --> 01:29:00,370
What... what chance did she get?

1315
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:03,300
If you can make it to that highway,

1316
01:29:03,340 --> 01:29:04,970
you're a free man.

1317
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,340
Where-Where's...
where-where is the highway?

1318
01:29:07,370 --> 01:29:09,240
You know how far that drill camp was

1319
01:29:09,250 --> 01:29:10,620
from where I found Natalie's body?

1320
01:29:10,630 --> 01:29:11,590
No.

1321
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:14,250
Six miles. Barefoot.

1322
01:29:16,450 --> 01:29:18,820
That's a warrior.

1323
01:29:20,890 --> 01:29:22,520
That's a warrior.

1324
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:25,730
You? You may make 600 feet, but...

1325
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:27,630
- Uh...
- ...you better get going.

1326
01:29:27,660 --> 01:29:30,660
But...

1327
01:29:30,700 --> 01:29:34,470
I don't understand. I don't understand.

1328
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:36,500
What do you want me to do?!

1329
01:29:36,540 --> 01:29:39,310
I want you to run.

1330
01:29:49,350 --> 01:29:52,920
<i>♫ Far from your loving eyes ♫</i>

1331
01:29:57,820 --> 01:30:02,260
<i>♫ In a place where winter never comes ♫</i>

1332
01:30:07,530 --> 01:30:10,500
<i>♫ Far from your loving eyes ♫</i>

1333
01:30:13,770 --> 01:30:17,640
<i>♫ And all along the wind I run ♫</i>

1334
01:30:21,110 --> 01:30:23,620
<i>♫ Far from your loving eyes ♫</i>

1335
01:30:25,550 --> 01:30:28,390
<i>♫ And all along the wind I run... ♫</i>

1336
01:30:35,060 --> 01:30:38,630
<i>♫ I return to this place ♫</i>

1337
01:30:44,540 --> 01:30:46,670
<i>♫ Close my eyes again. ♫</i>

1338
01:31:10,730 --> 01:31:12,760
How you feeling?

1339
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:14,830
I feel okay.

1340
01:31:16,940 --> 01:31:18,940
I got you something.

1341
01:31:18,970 --> 01:31:23,070
Thought maybe it'd give you
a little taste of home.

1342
01:31:27,610 --> 01:31:29,620
Little crocodile.

1343
01:31:29,650 --> 01:31:32,020
Please don't make me laugh.

1344
01:31:33,650 --> 01:31:36,490
It's an alligator.

1345
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:39,790
He'll protect you, better than
that bulletproof vest, right?

1346
01:31:43,700 --> 01:31:46,730
I shouldn't joke about that...
it saved your life.

1347
01:31:47,900 --> 01:31:50,540
You saved my life.

1348
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:55,370
Well...

1349
01:32:01,050 --> 01:32:04,020
Jane, you're a tough woman.

1350
01:32:04,050 --> 01:32:06,490
You saved your own life.

1351
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:09,120
We should both be honest.

1352
01:32:09,160 --> 01:32:10,430
I just...

1353
01:32:11,720 --> 01:32:14,130
I got lucky.

1354
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:18,030
Well, you know, luck don't live out here.

1355
01:32:18,060 --> 01:32:20,470
Luck lives in the city.

1356
01:32:23,070 --> 01:32:25,570
Don't live out here.

1357
01:32:26,940 --> 01:32:28,910
You know, that's whether you get,

1358
01:32:28,940 --> 01:32:31,540
you know, hit by a bus or not.

1359
01:32:31,580 --> 01:32:34,010
Whether your... bank is robbed or not,

1360
01:32:34,050 --> 01:32:36,010
or whether someone's...
on their damn cell phone

1361
01:32:36,050 --> 01:32:38,220
when they come up
to a crosswalk... that's luck.

1362
01:32:38,250 --> 01:32:39,890
That's winning or losing.

1363
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:43,020
Out here, you survive
or you surrender. Period.

1364
01:32:43,060 --> 01:32:46,970
That's determined by your
strength and by your spirit.

1365
01:32:48,230 --> 01:32:50,930
Wolves don't kill unlucky deer.

1366
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:53,000
They kill the weak ones.

1367
01:32:53,030 --> 01:32:55,870
You fought for your life, Jane.

1368
01:32:58,170 --> 01:33:00,970
Now you get to walk away with it.

1369
01:33:05,180 --> 01:33:07,450
You get to go home.

1370
01:33:16,020 --> 01:33:18,590
I know what you're doing.

1371
01:33:20,260 --> 01:33:23,030
I'm gonna read to you from a magazine.

1372
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:28,770
<i>«Ten Signs That He's Into You.»</i>

1373
01:33:30,300 --> 01:33:32,670
Things that I really want to know.

1374
01:33:32,710 --> 01:33:35,920
<i>«He looks you in the eye when he speaks.»</i>

1375
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:39,610
Ain't you supposed to do...

1376
01:33:42,620 --> 01:33:46,030
She ran six miles in the snow.

1377
01:33:48,250 --> 01:33:50,120
Yes, she did.

1378
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:08,570
Hello?

1379
01:34:11,580 --> 01:34:13,040
Martin?

1380
01:34:25,890 --> 01:34:28,130
Martin?

1381
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:32,130
Hey.

1382
01:34:41,670 --> 01:34:44,010
Martin?

1383
01:35:14,970 --> 01:35:16,840
Annie?

1384
01:37:03,150 --> 01:37:04,880
Hey.

1385
01:37:10,390 --> 01:37:13,290
What's with the paint?

1386
01:37:14,260 --> 01:37:16,760
It's my death face.

1387
01:37:18,230 --> 01:37:20,130
Is that right?

1388
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:26,340
And how would you know what that is?

1389
01:37:26,370 --> 01:37:27,940
I don't.

1390
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:31,140
Just made it up.

1391
01:37:31,180 --> 01:37:34,050
'Cause there's no one left to teach me.

1392
01:37:42,520 --> 01:37:44,920
I was ready to quit.

1393
01:37:47,190 --> 01:37:50,000
Then the phone rang.

1394
01:37:50,030 --> 01:37:52,430
Which is never good.

1395
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:56,430
But today it was.

1396
01:37:59,340 --> 01:38:02,810
First time Chip's called me
in over a year.

1397
01:38:05,980 --> 01:38:08,380
Where is he?

1398
01:38:08,410 --> 01:38:10,480
The station.

1399
01:38:12,890 --> 01:38:15,260
I was gonna go pick him up.

1400
01:38:15,290 --> 01:38:18,220
As soon as I washed this shit off my face.

1401
01:38:21,330 --> 01:38:23,760
Heard about what happened.

1402
01:38:26,270 --> 01:38:29,110
Heard there's one still missing.

1403
01:38:29,140 --> 01:38:30,780
No.

1404
01:38:32,910 --> 01:38:35,220
No one's missing.

1405
01:38:39,080 --> 01:38:41,280
How'd he go out?

1406
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:47,320
With a whimper.

1407
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:56,860
You better go easy on Chip.

1408
01:38:56,900 --> 01:39:00,000
Suffering's hard on young men;
they don't have our practice.

1409
01:39:04,170 --> 01:39:06,370
I should go get him.

1410
01:39:07,340 --> 01:39:09,040
Yeah, but I...

1411
01:39:09,080 --> 01:39:11,290
just need to sit here...

1412
01:39:13,350 --> 01:39:15,560
...and miss her for a minute.

1413
01:39:20,350 --> 01:39:22,520
You got time to sit with me?

1414
01:39:24,490 --> 01:39:27,060
Oh, I ain't goin' nowhere.

1415
01:40:30,220 --> 01:40:33,160
<i>♫ I've been traveling ♫</i>

1416
01:40:33,190 --> 01:40:35,660
<i>♫ Flying on south again ♫</i>

1417
01:40:35,690 --> 01:40:37,260
<i>♫ How ♫</i>

1418
01:40:37,300 --> 01:40:40,270
<i>♫ How could it be ♫</i>

1419
01:40:41,230 --> 01:40:43,670
<i>♫ It seems as though ♫</i>

1420
01:40:43,700 --> 01:40:46,570
<i>♫ A moment ago ♫</i>

1421
01:40:46,610 --> 01:40:49,250
<i>♫ I was reaping the seeds ♫</i>

1422
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:51,250
<i>♫ That I sow ♫</i>

1423
01:40:52,410 --> 01:40:55,550
<i>♫ Now, morning blows quickly through ♫</i>

1424
01:40:55,580 --> 01:40:58,250
<i>♫ Afternoon follows suit ♫</i>

1425
01:40:58,280 --> 01:41:01,550
<i>♫ How am I to get these things done? ♫</i>

1426
01:41:03,320 --> 01:41:05,690
<i>♫ Well, time stays ♫</i>

1427
01:41:05,720 --> 01:41:09,190
<i>♫ When counted by days ♫</i>

1428
01:41:09,230 --> 01:41:12,600
<i>♫ A looming and ominous shade ♫</i>

1429
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:17,100
<i>♫ Worry been breaking ♫</i>

1430
01:41:17,140 --> 01:41:19,670
<i>♫ And bringing me down ♫</i>

1431
01:41:19,710 --> 01:41:24,120
<i>♫ And counting all the times that I fall ♫</i>

1432
01:41:25,380 --> 01:41:30,620
<i>♫ But when my time comes ♫</i>

1433
01:41:30,650 --> 01:41:34,390
<i>♫ I won't be counting at all ♫</i>

1434
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:40,560
<i>♫ I feel all my filth ♫</i>

1435
01:41:40,590 --> 01:41:43,330
<i>♫ When I look in your eyes ♫</i>

1436
01:41:46,730 --> 01:41:48,630
<i>♫ But it falls ♫</i>

1437
01:41:48,670 --> 01:41:51,300
<i>♫ Light as a feather ♫</i>

1438
01:41:51,340 --> 01:41:54,540
<i>♫ On my back in the night ♫</i>

1439
01:41:59,310 --> 01:42:02,250
<i>♫ Man, you said meet me there ♫</i>

1440
01:42:02,280 --> 01:42:04,720
<i>♫ How do I get from here ♫</i>

1441
01:42:04,750 --> 01:42:06,650
<i>♫ To where ♫</i>

1442
01:42:06,690 --> 01:42:09,430
<i>♫ Where I belong? ♫</i>

1443
01:42:10,590 --> 01:42:13,060
<i>♫ It ain't just like finding ♫</i>

1444
01:42:13,090 --> 01:42:15,660
<i>♫ A sign to get home ♫</i>

1445
01:42:15,690 --> 01:42:19,400
<i>♫ It's building your house on the stone ♫</i>

1446
01:42:21,700 --> 01:42:23,800
<i>♫ Worry been breaking ♫</i>

1447
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:27,250
<i>♫ And bringing me down ♫</i>

1448
01:42:27,270 --> 01:42:31,080
<i>♫ And counting all the times that I fall ♫</i>

1449
01:42:32,710 --> 01:42:38,280
<i>♫ But when my time comes ♫</i>

1450
01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:42,250
<i>♫ I won't be counting at all ♫</i>

1451
01:42:45,390 --> 01:42:47,360
<i>♫ I feel all my filth ♫</i>

1452
01:42:47,390 --> 01:42:51,030
<i>♫ When I look in your eyes ♫</i>

1453
01:42:54,430 --> 01:42:56,530
<i>♫ But it falls ♫</i>

1454
01:42:56,570 --> 01:42:58,540
<i>♫ Light as a feather ♫</i>

1455
01:42:58,570 --> 01:43:01,540
<i>♫ On my back in the night ♫</i>

1456
01:43:06,250 --> 01:43:08,860
<i>♫ Your house, it will cover you ♫</i>

1457
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:12,450
<i>♫ But the rain still falls outside ♫</i>

1458
01:43:17,320 --> 01:43:19,460
<i>♫ Your light, it don't shine ♫</i>

1459
01:43:19,490 --> 01:43:21,760
<i>♫ 'Cause it's hidden ♫</i>

1460
01:43:21,790 --> 01:43:23,830
<i>♫ Under a bed ♫</i>

1461
01:43:28,670 --> 01:43:30,540
<i>♫ Why ♫</i>

1462
01:43:30,570 --> 01:43:32,770
<i>♫ Do you hide ♫</i>

1463
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:35,440
<i>♫ Under a bed? ♫</i>
