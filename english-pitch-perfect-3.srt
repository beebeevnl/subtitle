a real singer. I have a couple thoughts.

it's my job

68
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,154
to make you the best little
Pimp-Lo that you can be,

69
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,074
and... and I want to
get behind "Bend Over."

70
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,800
And, as your producer, I would
love it if you could trust me.

71
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,111
I would love it if you leave
my track how it is.

I think what she means is,

74
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,920
your song was always great.

75
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,639
No, what I mean
is what you gave me

76
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,439
was a steaming pile of... Pimp-Lo!

77
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,320
Okay. There's something
that you should know.

78
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,631
Uh, Beca...

79
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,712
is on her period.
Wow.

80
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,792
Oh, it's shark week? Hot damn. Bum-bum.

Y'all keepin' it one hundred.
That's my moms right there.

82
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,676
You know what it is.
Mm-hmm.

83
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,797
Still menstruating? Hmm.
Okay.

84
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,315
If you could just
excuse us for a second.

85
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,390
What are you doing?

86
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,080
How can you take his side?

87
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,879
Sides? Well, we...

88
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,360
Why are we always talking
about sides?

89
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,193
Okay, it's our job, brah.

90
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,350
We're producers.

91
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,558
We bring his vision to life.

92
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,235
Damn! That's poppin'!

93
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,712
Hey!

94
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,595
I did it.

95
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,678
I finally quit my job.

96
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,759
And I'm free, I'm free.
I'm never going back

97
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,479
to that job again.

98
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,995
It's the best day of my life.
I mean, I can't be

99
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,150
a music producer
without integrity.

100
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,674
What's up?

101
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,036
What?

102
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,713
Wait. S... Something's wrong.

103
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,757
Your face is more pinched
than normal.

104
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,274
I... I finally did it.

105
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,957
You got back together
with Jesse?

106
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,600
No! You know the long-distance
thing didn't work.

107
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,555
He lives 3,000 miles away with
his girlfriend and their cat.

108
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,280
Oh. He got over you much
quicker than what I thought.

109
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,795
Oh, thank you, Amy.
Much faster than Bumper,

110
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,476
who is rightfully
still devastated.

111
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,234
You know he got a tattoo
of me on his butt cheek?

112
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,075
So now, every time he wants
to see me, he's like...

113
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,480
He's just...

114
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,313
Okay. Um...
That made me dizzy.

115
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,915
Wait, what's up?
I quit my job.

116
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,276
You got fired?
Oh, come on.

117
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,430
All right.
I... I didn't get fired.

118
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,550
I quit.
Come here.

119
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,518
You're kind of making it worse.

120
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,512
Let this negative energy
be released!

121
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,512
Seriously, open your legs.
It'll come out quicker.

122
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,239
No, no.
It'll come out quicker,

123
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,113
the bad energy.
Why do you do this stuff?

124
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,634
Okay, seriously.
Why are you like this?

125
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,916
You're gonna come back
from this so fast. Mm.

126
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,198
You know why? Because you have
an amazing best friend.

127
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,430
Is that you?

128
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,510
Yeah.

129
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,920
Okay.
And also...

130
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,157
You need to pay the rent.

131
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,720
Just a little.

132
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,837
Uh, every month,
we have to do it. Ugh.

133
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,950
Right.

134
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,030
Yeah.

135
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,395
You could get a job, you know.

136
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,559
Beca, you're in shock.

137
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,393
You need something to eat.

138
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,470
Yeah. Just sit down.

139
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,677
Not these, though.
They're mine.

140
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,750
Hey, guys.

141
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,956
Hey, Chloe!

142
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,435
Why aren't you guys ready?

143
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,279
Why are you wearing that?

144
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,556
What?
Did you wear that to work?

145
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,994
Yeah, underneath my scrubs.

146
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,560
Well, sweetie, why?

147
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,518
Because it reminds me
I was special once.

148
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,560
But also because tonight
is, you... you know...

149
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,919
the Bellas reunion
at the Brooklyn Aquarium.

150
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,633
Hello!
That's tonight?

151
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,074
- Aw, yeah!
- You know what?

152
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,514
I will take it.
I need a distraction anyway.

153
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,115
Yeah. Yes, you do! Whoo!
I love it. Here we go!

154
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,270
What happened?

155
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,431
She got fired today.
No.

156
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,112
Hey, Stacie.
Oh, my God!

157
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,352
Finally!
Aw. Good to see you.

158
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,033
What's up, pitches?

159
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,635
Hi, Beca.

160
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,756
I missed you guys so much.

161
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,194
I can't wait for us
to sing together.

162
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,316
I'm so excited.

163
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,430
Hey, ladies.

164
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,000
Let's crush this.

165
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,958
Hello.
Stacie!

166
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,110
Hi!

167
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,594
Hey, Bellas.

168
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,796
Hi!
Hi!

169
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,837
Thank you so much
for inviting us.

170
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,151
Of course. So, what do you
want us to sing tonight?

171
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,754
A little "Who Run the World,"
some "Bulletproof"?

172
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,240
You didn't tell us
what the crowd was,

173
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,640
but I, um...
What's she talking about?

174
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,439
I brought this, just in case.

175
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,557
Oh, God.
Our voices are warm.

176
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,310
Um, we didn't
invite you guys to sing.

177
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,392
We invited you to...

178
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,314
watch us sing.
Watch.

179
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,957
Aca-scuse me?

180
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,237
I just thought you guys
were so busy with your...

181
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,071
your awesome jobs
and amazing lives.

With a shot of white privilege.

184
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,990
Oh. Hey, baby.

185
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,836
Mayday! Mayday!

186

I have one of those. Yes.

go get ready.

I'll see you guys?

After? Okay.
Totally.

205
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,795
All right, maybe.

00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,035
Whoo!

255
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,109
Thanks.

256
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,238
You know, we could just start
singing right now.

the B-team Bellas.

You guys!

261
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,200
You guys, I am so sorry.

262
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,112
I realize I should not have
used the word "reunion."

263
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,669
I should have said that it was
an excuse to see each other.

264
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,353
I really didn't
think that out. I'm sorry.

265
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,318
No, no, no.
You guys were so great.

266
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,800
And this was
a really nice chance

267
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,916
for us to get together.

268
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,150
Right, ladies?

269
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,471
Yeah, sure.

270
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,074
Oh, yes, really great.

271
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,594
Thank you so much.

272
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,479
I was supposed to go
to my brother's wedding,

273
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,870
but this is nice, too.

274
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,153
Bellas, a toast.

275
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,959
There!
Toast! Yay!

276
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,514
To the most amazing

277
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,240
group of women
I have ever known.

278
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,277
I would do anything

279
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,919
to sing with you guys again.

280
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,714
Anything!

281
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,958
I mean, really,
I could just crap myself!

282
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,110
Oh.

283
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,233
Cheers.

284
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,198
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I'm having a crazy idea.

285
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,677
Okay, I've mentioned
that my dad is in the Army

286
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,513
and, like, basically killed
Osama bin Laden, right?

287
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,557
Some new information
in that sentence, but okay.

288
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,757
What I mean is, he's kind
of a big deal in the Army.

289
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,275
And every year, the USO
puts on this performance

290
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,033
to entertain
and support the troops.

291
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,874
And this year,
DJ Khaled is hosting.

292
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,314
He's got, like,
a gazillion hit songs,

293
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,312
and he's super famous.

294
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,517
I saw him on a tax commercial.

295
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,637
What if I could get us
an invite?

296
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,359
To sing?

297
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,035
No, to run military dark ops.

298
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,399
Yes, of course, to sing.

299
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,472
Is there a competition?

300
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,835
There should always be
a competition.

301
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,833
Oh, um...
well, well, no, but...

302
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,957
let's sing together again.

303
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,316
And... and maybe
I'll see my dad.

304
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,551
Or maybe I won't,
you know, because he has

305
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,154
something really important
to do.

306
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,959
Or maybe I'll be
the most important thing

307
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,032
in his life this time.

308
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,032
Maybe.

309
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,515
Who's with me?
Me. Mm-hmm.

310
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,276
Yeah. I suddenly have a lot
of free time, so hell yeah.

311
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,192
Well, I just got
kicked out of flight school

312
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,272
for killing 300 fake people.

313
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,159
I hate fake people.
I hate a fake bitch.

314
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,672
Can you fly when
you're eight months pregnant?

315
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,399
- What?
- No.

316
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,709
Um...

317
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,399
Look.

318
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,073
That's...
that's eight months pregnant?

319
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,879
You guys didn't notice?

320
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,076
Well, congratulations.
Oh, my God.

321
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,832
I mean, I'm so happy for you.
Amazing!

322
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,274
Do you know who the father is?

323
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,476
Eh.

324
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,880
Congratulations.

325
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,758
Happy accidents.

326
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,150
Okay, well, Stacie's out.

327
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,039
So I guess, Emily, you're in.

328
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,032
Oh, yeah. I'm in for sure.

329
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,839
Yay.

330
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,640
Was I not always in?

331
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,949
Oh, no, no, no. Of course.

332
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,070
Oh, cool. I... Okay.

333
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,959
Hola, senoritas.

334
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,952
Where'd you guys even come from?

335
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,633
A little town called
Persistence, sweet cheeks.

336
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,870
That's right.
Here, here's the thing.

337
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,389
Look at this, ladies.

338
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,880
All-access passes.

339
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,236
We're tall enough
for all the rides.

340
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,994
You can run,
but you cannot hide.

341
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,639
This d'aca'mentary is happening!

342
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,076
We're gonna film
this whole thing.

343
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,196
It's gonna be beautiful.

344
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,430
We're making a beautiful
d'aca'mentary.

345
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,510
In fact, we gotta set up.

346
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,636
Where are we gonna set up, John?

347
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,790
I want to give you the...

348
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,712
Papi chulos, straight ahead.

349
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,718
Welcome to Spain, Bellas.

350
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,712
A few important things
to note before we begin.

351
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,951
Grab your luggage.

352
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,032
All right, thank you.

353
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,277
You always want
to stay 25 feet...

354
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,072
...Choke.

355
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,119
...very sharp. We do not
want you to impale yourself.

356
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,876
I hope you all heard
each and every word,

357
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,789
or else you might
very well end up dead.

358
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,795
Ladies, I'm messing with you.

359
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,758
On behalf of the Department
of Defense, we would like

360
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,196
to welcome you to
Naval Air Station Rota, Spain.

361
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,477
And a sincere thank-you
for coming out to entertain

362
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,789
our troops and their families.

363
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,234
We're excited for this tour.

364
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,152
My name's Chicago.
Over here to my left

365
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,232
is Captain Bernie,
who we like to call Zeke.

366
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,960
Ladies. We're gonna be
with you the whole tour

367
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,633
- as your escorts and security details.
- Question.

368
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,638
Will we all be
showering together?

369
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,837
Uh, first up is a sound check.

370
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,913
We'll have you back
to the hotel by 1430.

371
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,480
Maybe hit the rain locker,

372
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,473
back here for the big show
at 1700. Yeah.

373
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,678
1700... is
that, like, later than the night?

374
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,830
It's 5:00.

375
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,354
Okay. Whatever.

376
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,830
- Okay... Yep.
- Question, question.

377
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,877
Um, so this is the first base.

378
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,520
Will we be going to
second base with you guys?

379
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,631
And then, maybe
a few days later,

380
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,598
we'll go to third base?

381
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,751
That's a "no" for me, so...

382
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,274
Wait, what's after
the third base?

383
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,953
Why don't we get you
to your first venue?

384
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,714
Come on.

385
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,070
All right, well, we are
really excited to have you here.

386
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,514
Right now we're in Hangar Three.

387
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,557
This is where we keep
all of our helicopters.

388
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,359
Of course, now we've got
the big stage

389
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,159
built up for the tour.

390
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,835
So, on the tour,
we've got three bands.

391
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,639
Over here, we got Saddle Up.

392
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,315
This is Young Sparrow
and DJ Dragon Nutz.

393
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,517
And behind me is Evermoist.

394
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,239
Oh!

395
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,277
And check it out.
DJ Khaled just rolled in.

396
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,874
Let's set the stage, all right?

397
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,394
Let's get ready before...
We should turn around

398
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,670
and shoot into it.
...the Bellas out.

399
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,750
Hey, guys.

400
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:25,876
Come say hey to the new group.

401
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,269
- Yo.
- Oh.

402
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,995
Hello. We're the Bellas,

403
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,800
formerly of Barden University
and currently of life.

404
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,874
Ladies.
Howdy.

405
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,435
Ladies, I want

406
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,590
to give you
a little forewarning.

407
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,000
My man's social anxiety,

408
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,157
when he's not behind the
turntables, it's kind of crazy.

409
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,755
- So be easy, all right?
- Hello.

410
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,274
♪ Hello ♪

411
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,269
♪ Is it me
you're looking for? ♪

412
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,633
Right on. I'm Calamity.

413
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,951
This is Serenity,
Veracity and Charity.

414
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,110
- Hey.
- Hi.

415
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,954
If I joined your group,
I could be Obesity.

416
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,318
Get it? SERENITY: Oh,
if you're wondering,

417
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,278
our presence here has
nothing to do with... Nothing.

418
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,511
...the nationally televised
"Salute to the Troops" special

419
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,274
where DJ Khaled is going to
pick one group to open for him

420
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,589
at the end of this tour.

421
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,717
That was a lot of exposition.

422
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,709
So there is a competition.

423
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,195
I knew it.

424
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,880
And so there is.
Idiots!

425
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,950
What, do you think we

426
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,394
care about just watching
you guys?

427
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,199
It's a competition! Hello!

428
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,556
You guys just sing
other people's songs, right?

429
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,757
Like a cover band.
No, no, no, no.

430
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,240
No.
Uh, no, no, no. Uh, well,

431
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,994
actually, Emily writes
original songs for the Bellas.

432
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,554
I mean, I don't really
do it anymore.

433
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,359
I kind of did that one,
and then I...

434
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,352
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
You with us or against us?

435
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,591
And it was one of your dads who gave you

436
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,200
the spot on the tour, right?

437
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,158
Oh, my God.
Um...

438
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,310
- Ooh...
- Guys, stop.

439
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,834
They just don't like
sharing the spotlight,

440
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,115
so they're trying
to intimidate us.

441
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,953
Let's just take the high road
and do what we do.

442
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,873
You thinking what I'm
thinking? What are you thinking?

443
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,394
A riff-off.

444
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,631
That's not what I was
thinking. A riff-off!

445
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,110
Wait. Yes.
A riff-off! Yes!

446
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,793
What is a riff-off?
Yeah.

447
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,360
A riff-off is a little game

448
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,591
that we like to play
to see who's better.

449
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,558
Mm-hmm.
We start with a topic. Um...

450
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,359
Let's say "party songs."
Nice.

451
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,113
Yeah, and then we
lay down a beat.

452
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,954
Oh, yeah, bring it, Bellas!

453
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,714

Yeah, so you guys saw
what we did there, right?

00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,557
Yeah.
So... it's singing.

475
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,915
No, well...

476
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,832
We just took the last word
of the old song

477
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,195
and matched it
with the first word

478
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,953
of the new song,
but you stay on tempo,

479
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,753
stay on beat,
stay on pitch and, of course,

480
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,559
- keep it in the relative key.
- That was great.

481
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,154

Uh, and...

604
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,357

Oh.

618
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,909

619
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,116
Why are you here?

620
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,793
Oh, boy. Um...

621
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,917
Long story short,
I was in the NG,

622
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,118
but my CO recommended me
for OCS after, uh, AIT.

623
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,840
Then came OBC
and RTB where I, uh,

624
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,798
was the, uh, DG of my class.

625
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,156
It's... I don't know.

626
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,033
Sorry. Um...

627
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,713
I joined the National Guard.

628
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,519
They helped put me
through college.

629
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,320
I spent about
a year stationed in Kabul.

630
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,438
Uh, actually overseeing
a canine unit over there.

631
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,034
We trained German shepherds,

632
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,600
we trained pit bulls...

633
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,399
Dogs.

634
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,550
I love dogs.

635
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,359
I love animals, in general.

636
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,750
Animals are cute.
You're cute. I mean, what?

637
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,832
- What about you?
- Me? Me.

638
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,115
Uh, shorter story...

639
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,669
I was in a singing group
in college,

640
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:08,232
and then now I am still
in that same singing group,

641
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,312
but not in college.

642
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,715
But you're committed.
I am committed.

643
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,950
That's great.
Yeah, I love commitment

644
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,440
and being committed.
Yeah.

645
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,352
Not to, like, an asylum.
Whoa.

646
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,920
Or, like, a hospital, like,
I'm not saying...

647
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,514
Yeah, no, I know. But,
like... just, I like...

648
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,512
I love love. I love
being committed to love.

649
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,355
Not to you, but to, like... I
love, um, like, oranges. I love...

650
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,839
Hey. Uh, girls?

651
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,320
We have separate rooms.
We don't have to

652
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,550
sleep on top
of each other anymore.

653
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,518
What? AUBREY: Hey, that's great.

654
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,080
Um, not sexually.

655
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,640
There was that one time.

656
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,357
Stop being so loud.

657
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,039
Yeah. No, yeah.
Oh, that's what I want.

658
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,440
Uh, no, that's the molasses one.

659
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,954
No, you're not gonna
like that one.

660
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,394
This one.
I don't want molasses.

661
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,233
Okay, you guys, so we've never

662
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,192
competed against bands
that play actual instruments.

663
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,515
What's the plan?

664
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,274
I really think we should just
stay true to ourselves,

665
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,556
and it will all figure
itself out.

666
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,916
Emily? Please hear this
in the best way possible.

667
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,838
You're a very stupid person.

668
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,992
You know what?
Maybe it won't matter

669
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,311
if we win or not, because
they will like us so much

670
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,278
that they will invite us
to keep touring with them.

671
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,079
And it won't matter
if I get into vet school

672
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,753
because we will be together
as a family,

673
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,354
supporting each other.

674
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,193
And really, isn't that
what it's all about?

675
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,112
- Yes.
- Yes.

676
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,953
Yeah, except for all
families break apart,

677
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,750
and the only person you can
ever truly rely on is yourself.

678
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,153
All right, time to drop a smash.

679
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,392
What?
Oh, no, no, no.

680
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,119

Uh, hola. Um...

706
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,320
Uh, excusez-moi.
Bonjour. Ciao.

707
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,631
No hablo...
Inglese? Konnichiwa?

708
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,473
The...
Sa-Na-ma-Na-ma?

709
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,313
You're English. Hi.

710
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,960
That's right. I saw you do
the, uh, sound check,

711
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:28,078
um, thing that you guys...
Yeah. The riff-off thing.

712
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,435
Riff-off.
Yeah. I don't know why we

713
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,840
keep challenging people
to those.

714
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,115
We... we don't ever
actually win.

715
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,078
Oh.
Do you work for the USO?

716
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,197
Uh, no,
I... I work for DJ Khaled.

717
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,794
Sorry. I'm... I'm Theo.

718
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,950
Hi. I'm Beca.

719
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,793
Nice to meet you.
How you doing?

720
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,950
Sorry, you are a...

721
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,156
Oh, I'm a...
Music executive?

722
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,356
...music exec
at Khaled's label.

723
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,669
Really?
Yeah.

724
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,353
What?
No, I... I... I work

725
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,920
with music executives,
and you...

726
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,639
they... they
don't look like you.

727
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,915
Oh.

728
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,390
What do I look like?

729
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,709
A turtle.

730
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,157
Well, that's in...
incredibly specific.

731
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,799
But, like, you literally
look just like that.

732
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,195
No, no. It's accurate.

733
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,555
You said you work
with music execs.

734
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,951
Oh. Yeah.
Um, no, I'm a...

735
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,235
I'm a music producer.

736
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,879
I'm sort of freelancing
right now.

737
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,633
Oh, and I sing for fun.

738
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,235
I'm interested to see
the Bellas in action.

739
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,552
Yeah, maybe we'll even open
for DJ Khaled in the end.

740
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,632
You don't think
you'll open for Khaled?

741
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,951
Uh, no, I... I...
I didn't say that.

742
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,111
Yeah, you did. You did.
You just said it before.

743
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,600
You kind of implied it,
if anything.

744
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,080
Well, I just...
I could just

745
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,880
tell him that you sing
for fun, if you like.

746
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,440
No, I... I was just
trying to... I... I'm...

747
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,113
I'm gonna go now.
I'll see you later,

748
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,350
but I'll be watching.

749
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,760
Okay.
Good luck. See you.

We are Evermoist.

794
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,316
Oh, wow!

795
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,312
Who doesn't want to see that
on "Salute the Troops"

796
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,676
next week, huh? Keep it
going.

00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,319
Whoo!

798
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,198

Hey. How y'all doing?

And now,

801
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,758
an a cappella group
with a few YouTube clicks.

802
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,753
So, put your hands together
for the Bellas.

803
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,152
The Bellas reunited
finally onstage.

804
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,516
They're gonna rock these
troops with their mouth music.

805
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,557
And, as predicted, Gail,

806
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,518
the Bellas are in
over their heads,

807

Tough blow. What was that?

858
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,239
That, my friend, was "Taps"

859
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,794
from the back of the house.

860
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,109
Salute, salute.
We have to salute.

861
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,793
Stand at attention.
This is "Taps."

862
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,872
It's to honor fallen soldiers,

863
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,031
and tonight,
it's the fallen Bellas.

864
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,914
Look at this. Those girls
don't even know what to do.

865
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,474
They look like idiots.

866
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,153
This is the best thing
for the movie.

867
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,118
It couldn't be better.

868
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,673
Should we be considering
using instruments?

869
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,320
Is that crazy?

870
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,278
Oh, that's so funny.

871
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,238
You know, I'm gonna pretend
that you didn't just say that

872
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,549
so we can still be friends.

873
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,240
If we had drums,
then we wouldn't need Lilly,

874
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,879
and if we had bass,
then we wouldn't need me.

875
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,996
And we're still not clear

876
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,309
why Jessica and Ashley
are even here.

877
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,880
D... Did they just say
our names?

878
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,553
Don't be stupid.

879
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,472
You know what? I have an idea.

880
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,155
We just need to show DJ Khaled
that we are different

881
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,313
and better than all of
those other bands, you know?

882
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,629
I think we did great.

883
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,030
I just think the horn
cut our vibe.

884
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,277
True that.

885
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,555
All right, ladies.
Pick up your tits.

886
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,869
We're going out.

887
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,155
What do you mean, "going out"?

888
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,469
What do you mean,
what do I mean?

889
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,756
We just sucked balls
in front of DJ Khaled.

890
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:00,275
Listening.
He's staying at that fancy

891
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,510
casino hotel
across the street, okay?

892
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,398
I say we all get up,
we get dressed,

893
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,234
we go over there, and we show
him that we are not a joke.

894
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,155
Emily, I can't believe

895
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,517
that a half-decent idea
came out of your dumb mouth.

896
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,114
Thank you.
Okay?

897
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,157
- So let's get tarted up and...
- Tatted up?

898
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:20,119
Tarted. Yeah, yeah, tarted up.
It sounds like "tatted up."

899
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,873
She means "tatted."
She's the caramel tart.

900
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,270
She's a chocolate tart.
You're the vanilla tart.

901
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,953
Thanks, babe.

902
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,191
Mm...

903
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,000
Oh, "tarted."
Oh, "tarted." "Tarted."

904
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,440
If it's easier,
we'll just say "slutty."

905
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,840
Okay, let's get slutty.
We'll dress slutty.

906
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,752
Okay, great.
For attention.

907
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,990
Let's aca-rock this.

908
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,197
Yes.
Like music industry slutty.

909
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,318
Are you ready?
Let's go, ladies! Come on!

910
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,440
Okay, ladies.

911
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,716
I think we should split up.
Divide and conquer.

912
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,439
You ready?
Mm-hmm.

913
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,717
Let's rock it.

914
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,234
Lilly, come with me.

915
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,993
Let's go this way.

916
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,920
We've been expecting you.

917
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,390
Please be our guest
in the high-roller VIP room.

918
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,517
Naturally.

919
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,671
Yay!

920
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,877
I bet it all on 21.

921
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,350
The minimum bet
is a thousand dollars.

922
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:36,195
Oh, okay, well,
do you happen to have...

923
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,476
seven ATM machines?

924
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,434
I'll stake her.

925
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,398
Hello, Sunshine.

926
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,715
Daddy.

927
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,594
General Douglas.
What an honor.

928
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,000
General.
Good to see you.

929
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,351
There's that guy. Hide. What?

930
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,272
Why are we hiding?

931
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,919
I don't know.

932
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,679
Dude, what is...

933
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,955
What is this about?

934
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,190
What are you guys doing?

935
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,470
Nothing.

936
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,472
Ain't that Mr. Eye Contact?

937
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,040
He knows Khaled, right?

938
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,156
We should follow him.

939
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,232
Okay, legacy, come on.

940
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,118
You guys, act normal, casual.
Here we go.

941
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,998
- Great idea.
- Patricia,

942
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,719
you know how worried
I've been about you?

943
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,916
You shouldn't have run away.

944
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,753
You should've talked to me.

945
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:26,039
About what, the C-4 explosives
I found in the cereal box?

946
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,552
Or what about the time
you smuggled drugs

947
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,438
in Sir Bounce-a-lot
and I had to see him

948
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,592
get torn apart by custom
agents right in front of me?

949
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,280
Sweetheart,
it was my profession.

950
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,352
What, being dodgy?

951
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,397
Well, that's one word for it.

952
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,473
I mean, yeah, I was a
criminal, but I'm different now.

953
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,876
How'd you even find me?

954
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,076
Well, what do you mean?

955
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,310
I've been in hiding.

956
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,834
Ah, my darling girl,

957
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,991
I've known where
you've been for years.

958
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:55,357
Uh, it's impossible for you
not to stand out in a crowd.

959
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,999
Yeah, why do I have to be
so brilliant

960
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,480
at every single thing I do?

961
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,671
Here, look.
I've always kept this photo

962
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,320
of you and me close to my heart.

963
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,869
We used to play together.
We used to sing together.

964
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,394
We used to be a team.

965
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,239
None of this is happening,
okay? But... but...

966
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,794
No "but, but, but." No!

967
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,519
But... darling.

968
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,718
I'm getting old, Sunshine.

969
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,031
I want to be a part
of your life.

970
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,514
Please.

971
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,353
You always do this.

972
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,635
What?
I'm not falling for it.

973
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,200
Not this time.
What? Now, now...

974
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,795
Patricia, stop!

975
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:29,151
Please, Patricia,
don't leave again.

976
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,835
No, wait, darling.

977
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,877
Stay with me, fellas.

Don't make me keep singing.

Act cool.
You be cool.

988
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,879
We got this.
This is big as a house.

989
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,394
Okay. Mm-hmm.

990
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,834
Hey.

991
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,152
Beca. Hey. Oh, what are you doing here?

992
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,516
I was waiting for you.
I don't... That's weird.

993
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,239
I saw you hiding
behind the bushes.

994
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,436
No, I don't think so.

995
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,079
This is a really popular
jumpsuit

996
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,196
and hairstyle, so that wasn't...

997
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,310
Oh.
You know what?

998
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,720
I see what's happened.

999
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,439
This is not my friend
Lenny's suite.

1000
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,920
That's embarrassing.

1001
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,480
Oh, no, it's, uh,
DJ Khaled's suite.

1002
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,676
Is it?

1003
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,433
Oh, I had no idea.

1004
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,954
We're throwing a...
a little party for him,

1005
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,355
if he decides to show.

1006
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,194
You guys should hang out.
You want to hang out?

1007
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,760
Twist my arm. We'll do it.

1008
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,035
Well, let's go.
I'll give you a tour.

1009
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,873
Great.
All right, come this way.

1010
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,919
Uh, Khaled, right now he's,
uh, into this kind of feng shui,

1011
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,832
so he has a specific kind
of arrangement

1012
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,798
to maximize his chi.

1013
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,839
And, oh, Sunburst here
is Khaled's juiceologist.

1014
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:05,116
Ah, Theo, pardon my zesting.

1015
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,350
Would you like a beet juice?

1016
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,590
Your glands look frustrated.

1017
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,875
In my country,

1018
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,474
beet juice was reserved
for the king.

1019
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,597
DJ Khaled is the king
of the beats.

1020
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:17,354
You know, like the...
Beat King, 'cause he's the...

1021
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,517
Oh, honey, that was...
we didn't like that at all.

1022
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,920
It's awful. I know.

1023
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,072
Um, can you explain this,
uh, terrifying situation?

1024
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,277
What? What, my... the face?
Not your face.

1025
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,591
Um, the thing behind you.
Oh, the apiary.

1026
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,957
Oh, right, yeah, no, this
is, uh, a portable beehive

1027
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,475
that Sunburst uses
to harvest natural honey.

1028
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,358
Doesn't seem like a disaster
waiting to happen.

1029
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,430
Yes, it can be.

1030
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,352
Oh, Beca,
I got to show you something.

1031
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,590
You're gonna love this.

1032
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,040
Sure.

1033
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,474
Yeah?
Yeah.

1034
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,676
I'll bring her right back.

1035
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:45,910
Oh... yeah, just her.

1036
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,150
Just borrow her for a second.

1037
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:48,435
Whatever.

1038
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,075
Ooh. Is that an AKG C-24?

1039
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,833
Yes, it certainly is.

1040
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,274
Incredibly rare.

1041
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,357
Madonna, Beyonce, Joan Baez.

1042
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,193
Oh, I'm happy for them.
That's nice.

1043
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,471
Yeah, the boss likes to be ready

1044
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,438
for whenever inspiration
strikes him,

1045
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,273
so we have this setup here.
Sure.

1046
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,920
Yeah, must be good to be
really, really, really rich.

1047
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,236
Yeah.

1048
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,800
You want to give it a go?

1049
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,075
No.
No?

1050
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,277
Couldn't possibly.

1051
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,511
Ooh.

1052
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,353
We're coming to you live.
Oh, that's nice.

1053
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,472
Oh, we should've recorded
that. Oh, she's a beaut.

1054
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,153
What's this?
Oh, this is just...

1055
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,152
Khaled has a...
a little loop going.

1056
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,197

I knew that song would get you.

1089
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,035
Whoo-hoo!
Oh, yeah.

1090
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,313
That's my girl.

1091
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,113
I can't wait.

1092
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:02,078
We'll travel the world
in my yacht,

1093
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,517
stop at all your favorite
places... the Atlantic Ocean,

1094
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,159
the Pacific Ocean...
That would be great!

1095
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,755
But I'm in the middle
of a tour right now.

1096
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,797
But that's perfect.
I'll finally be able

1097
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,758
to see one of your performances.

1098
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,957
Dad, you've never come
to any of my performances.

1099
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:19,477
Sweetheart, I've changed.

1100
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:22,394
It's not the first time
I've heard that.

1101
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,394
But you're still my little
Turnip Top, aren't you?

1102
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,679
I promise I won't
screw it up this time.

1103
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,877
General Posen and I
were wrapping up

1104
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,758
a, uh, clandestine operation.

1105
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:37,878
In fact, I've just come
from our classified briefing.

1106
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,600
Oh, my God, so you were just
with Aubrey's dad?

1107
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,319
He was so excited
to see your show.

1108
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,995
It's just too bad
that he can't make it.

1109
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,959
Oh.
Oh.

1110
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:49,759
Oh, that's okay.

1111
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,678
Yeah, it's... it's really
okay. No, that's okay.

1112
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,598
It's totally fine. You know,
he's a busy man. Uh-huh.

1113
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,592
That's right.
And my dad always said,

1114
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,798
"Expect finite disappointment,
and remember,

1115
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,513
"there's always more
where that came from."

1116
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,276
Oh, my God, Aubrey!

1117
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,436
Someone open a window!

1118
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,791
What is wrong with this door?
I don't know!

1119
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,713
Stand down!

1120
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,714
♪ Eh ♪

1121
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,757
♪ Eh
Oh, oh, oh, oh ♪

1122
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,959
Checkmate, Bellas.

1123
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:41,997
Checkmate.

1124
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,033
Oh, hey.

1125
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:52,112
Heard you all really, uh,
lit it up last night.

1126
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,999
That's a great joke.

1127
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,594
- It's really funny.
- Like a phoenix

1128
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:00,071
rising from the ashes,
only a really sad version

1129
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,391
where there's no phoenix
and just ash.

1130
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:24,232
Sorry, I forgot where we were
in the conversation.

1131
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:27,552
Next time, when you're trying
to impress DJ Khaled,

1132
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:29,836
try to have some dignity.

1133
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:33,800
Uh, we never do anything
with dignity, so...

1134
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:35,030
Hey, where'd you go last night?

1135
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,594
What, uh, you mean

1136
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,592
when you were burning down
the hotel?

1137
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,000
Dude, where were you?

1138
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:43,720
Okay. I was with my father,
all right?

1139
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,439
Wait, your dad?

1140
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,079
He's been trying
to track me down for years,

1141
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:48,435
and last night, he found me.

1142
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:50,671
Why are you running from him?

1143
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,558
I wish my dad
would pay attention to me.

1144
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,758
Because my dad
wasn't a very nice man.

1145
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,560
So, when I was 18,
I had to run away,

1146
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:01,394
which was a real bitch
because of the chafing.

1147
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,431
And now he has found me,

1148
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:07,638
and I don't know what to think.

1149
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:11,316
I mean, I... I think that's
amazing, and so should you.

1150
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,960
I mean, it... it's...
it's a crazy thing.

1151
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:16,111
He's finally found you
after all these years?

1152
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,351
Now you can rekindle
the relationship,

1153
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:20,238
and... and it could be
even stronger than it was.

1154
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,198
And maybe he was not
a very nice guy before,

1155
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:24,033
but maybe he is now,
and maybe he's amazing

1156
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:25,998
and wonderful and he wants...
Okay, Emily, you are so shrill

1157
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:27,514
and inarticulate!
No, no!

1158
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,599
Hello? Oh, it's Stacie.

1159
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,956
Stacie! Stacie's calling me
on FaceTime.

1160
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,554
You guys! Stop. Get
over here. What, Stacie?

1161
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,074
Oh, hello?
Wait. Right over here.

1162
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:37,554
Oh, hi, hi, hi.
You guys!

1163
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:39,711
Hi.
Stace!

1164
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,917
Where are you? Stacie,
it's going terrible here.

1165
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:43,474
Yeah, we getting our asses
handed to us.

1166
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:46,632
Guys, I had the baby.

1167
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,270
What?
Aw.

1168
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,350
He's so cute.

1169
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:52,193
She's a girl.

1170
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,760
Oh, okay, then average.

1171
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:54,910
What's her name?

1172
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,514
Baby Fat Amy
or Baby Fat Patricia.

1173
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:58,398
You can choose.
No, no, listen.

1174
00:49:58,480 --> 00:49:59,914
I know I've always been
your favorite.

1175
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:01,750
Guys.

1176
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,559
I named her Bella.

1177
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,040
Aw.

1178
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:07,474
That is adorable.
Oh, that's perfect.

1179
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:09,233
- That... Okay.
- I love you guys.

1180
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:11,477
We love you. We love
you so much. We miss you.

1181
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:12,835
You guys.

1182
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:15,230
She's so cute.

1183
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:17,232
Guys, can we stop trying
to win this tour

1184
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,879
and just sing together?

1185
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,952
I mean, that's why
we're all here, right?

1186
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:22,753
Yeah.

1187
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:25,116
But also, let's still try
and win this thing

1188
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,920
because I don't know
how else to live.

1189
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,151
Ciao, Bellas.

1190
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,594
Who wants to go to Italy?

1191
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,433
Four countries in four days.

1192
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,318
One, two... And then
DJ Khaled will announce

1193
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,915
the winner when we arrive
in France. Let's do this!

for the Barden Bellas.

1253
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,073
Yes, and as these young women
approach 30

1254
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,072
and cease to be of value
as human beings,

1255
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,277
perhaps this
is the bittersweet memory

1256
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:15,080
they will take
into the bar with them.

1257

Okay, welcome
to the South of France.

00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:34,116
We wanted to do something
kind of special for you guys.

1259
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,479
This feels like a group date
on The Bachelor.

1260
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,472
Oh, it's just so beautiful.

1261
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:41,597
Yeah, thank you.

1262
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,034
Not free.

1263
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:44,554
Got it.

1264
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,359
Hey.

1265
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:51,356
Um, hey, I just wanted to say
thank you for... for this.

1266
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,353
And for looking out
for us on this trip.

1267
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:58,354
And protecting
the United States... always.

1268
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,113
It's my pleasure.

1269
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,520
Must be kind of lonely,

1270
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,273
always being away
from your family,

1271
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:04,760
being in a different place.

1272
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:07,150
Yeah, but being in the Army
is kind of like

1273
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:08,879
having a second family,
you know.

1274
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:11,271
Well, yeah, of course you know.

1275
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:13,750
I mean, you guys come together
for your tour,

1276
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:15,593
and when it's over,
you go your separate ways.

1277
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:19,117
But you're always gonna be
there for each other, right?

1278
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:23,080
I mean, you're never
really alone.

1279
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,914
Wow, that was really cheesy.

1280
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,275
No.

1281
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:28,510
I liked it.

1282
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:35,950
You okay?

1283
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,315
Oh, yeah.

1284
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,915
Of course.

1285
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:42,719
Don't hide your feelings
from me.

1286
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:44,877
We're like sisters, Aubrey.

1287
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,714
It is "Aubrey," isn't it?

1288
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:51,111
Mm-hmm.

1289
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,795
Well, to be totally honest,
my dad was supposed to come

1290
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:55,394
to see us perform tomorrow,

1291
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,079
and I heard
that he can't make it.

1292
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:59,550
And he's never actually
heard me sing with the Bellas,

1293
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:01,871
and now maybe
he never will, so...

1294
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,952
Dad? He's here!

1295
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:05,679
What? Where?

1296
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,117
That's my dad's yacht,
the Fat Dingo Bitch.

1297
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,152
That's what he always
used to call my mum.

1298
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:13,197
Obviously, he's come

1299
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,795
to see me perform
in our last ever show!

1300
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,280
My dad came!

1301
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,113
Must feel aca-amazing.

1302
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:27,117
They gotta be
close to making a decision.

1303
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,192
They film the special
with DJ Khaled tomorrow.

1304
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,237
And he needs an opening act.

1305
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,960
Oh, look who it is.

1306
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:37,192
Did you guys see the way
they got off stage yesterday?

1307
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,680
They literally went out
of their way

1308
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:40,194
not to congratulate us.

1309
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:42,511
They clearly just see us
as a threat.

1310
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:46,558
Oh, shit!
Oh, my God.

1311
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:47,915
You are so weird.
Wow. Sometimes.

1312
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,071
That's not fair.
You seem very nice.

1313
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:51,554
Can I borrow you for a second?

1314
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:52,960
Yeah, great.
Yeah? Come on.

1315
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,235
You want to hold hands?

1316
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:55,356
Nope.
Cool.

1317
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:56,590
Where are we going?

1318
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,592
You remember when you
burnt down DJ Khaled's room?

1319
00:55:58,680 --> 00:55:59,955
No, that was not...

1320
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:01,190
I don't remember that.
Back in Spain?

1321
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,680
You were looking for Lenny,

1322
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:04,114
hiding behind the bushes,
released the bees.

1323
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,429
No, I think that...
that was my sister.

1324
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:06,556
I hate her. What?

1325
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,199
DJ Khaled wants to meet you.

1326
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:10,920
Why?
Hey, boss.

1327
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:14,033
Theo, my guy.

1328
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,873
Magical ears.

1329
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,474
Beca.
H... Hello.

1330
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,838
How beautiful.
Oh, thank you.

1331
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,559
So nice to meet you.
ASAP!

1332
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,916
Need a drink for Beca, ASAP!
Have a seat.

1333
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,195
Make yourself at home.

1334
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:27,470
Oh, my God.

1335
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:28,914
Thank you.

1336
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,753
Yeah.
Here you go, mademoiselle.

1337
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,194
Thank you.

1338
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:33,873
I hope you like cherries.

1339
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:36,077
Beca, have you been talking
to my guy, Theo?

1340
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,389
Yeah, he talks a lot.

1341
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,278
But I have no idea
what's going on.

1342
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:41,079
He doesn't actually give me
that much information.

1343
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:42,799
I thought maybe
you could break the news.

1344
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:44,479
Congratulations.

1345
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:45,789
On what?

1346
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:48,151
I want you to open up for me.

1347
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,515
Tomorrow night.

1348
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,353
Beca.

1349
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,432
DJ Khaled.

1350
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,079
Are you ready?

1351
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:59,553
Seriously?
Yeah.

1352
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,240
That is great.

1353
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:04,835
You are not gonna
regret this. I...

1354
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:07,719
The Bellas are gonna die.
Can I go tell them?

1355
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,234
I... I think
you misunderstood.

1356
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:10,919
Uh, what DJ Khaled's
trying to say here

1357
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,595
is that he doesn't want
the Bellas.

1358
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,036
We want you.

1359
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:17,594
- What?
- The other day,

1360
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:20,070
when you was just
playing around with the loop

1361
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:21,879
and you was singing
and you was just...

1362
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,277
I could tell that you was
just playing around, but...

1363
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:29,070
I seen something,
I heard something,

1364
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:31,800
then I felt something.

1365
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:33,473
Amidst the chaos,
I went back in the room,

1366
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:34,835
and I pulled your recording.

1367
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:38,072
Why did you do that?

1368
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:40,231
Because I wanted to know
what you could do on your own.

1369
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:43,040
Beca, it's time to go
to the next level.

1370
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:44,793
I see it.

1371
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,270
I'm DJ Khaled, aka Billy.

1372
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,995
Who?
I know these things.

1373
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:53,516
That is so amazing.

1374
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,034
That means the world to me,
honestly.

1375
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:56,839
But I'm part of a group,

1376
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:58,559
and we all have
something special.

1377
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:00,950
I respect
that you love your group,

1378
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:02,514
but it's time for you
to move on.

1379
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,398
It's time for you to grow.

1380
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:07,552
It's time for you to climb that
mountaintop and reach the top.

1381
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:09,438
And the group
will be happy for you.

1382
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,637
What Khaled is trying
to say here is that

1383
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:14,110
you've really gone as far
as you can with the girls.

1384
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,317
It's time for you
to now flourish on your own.

1385
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:19,359
Independent... ly.

1386
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:20,874
These ain't opinions.

1387
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,076
These are facts.

1388
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:23,640
Yes.

1389
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:25,200
Come with me a second.

1390
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,555
Bless up.

1391
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,836
Listen, I... I know it's a lot

1392
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,354
to take in, okay?
Uh, yeah.

1393
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:31,999
The label is gonna
sign you, Beca.

1394
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:34,117
The label's gonna sign you.
They're gonna help you

1395
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:36,590
develop your own material
as a solo act. Uh, yeah...

1396
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:38,512
Th... This is very generous,

1397
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:40,319
but we're talking
about my family.

1398
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:41,993
I'm... I'm...
I'm not interested.

1399
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:44,077
It's a tough decision.
I get that. No, it's not.

1400
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:46,629
It is. It is.

1401
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:49,360
It's a big opportunity
for you. All right?

1402
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,193
Look at me. Stop.

1403
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,078
What are you doing?

1404
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:56,753
Go home. Sleep on it.

1405
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:58,320
You come back, and you tell me

1406
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:01,234
what you want to do
in the morning, okay?

1407
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:03,391
All right?

1408
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,949
I'm... I really am sorry.
I...

1409
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,758
Whoo!

1410
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:35,556
Your performance
was incredible, Patricia.

1411
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:37,552
So proud of you.

1412
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:38,994
Thanks, Dad.
How did you see it?

1413
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:40,116
Were you on the base?

1414
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:41,998
Oh, you know me.
I've got my ways.

1415
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:44,675
What a note to go out on, eh?

1416
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:47,150
What do you say
we leave tonight?

1417
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:50,271
I would, but tomorrow's, like,

1418
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:52,670
the big televised event
with DJ Khaled,

1419
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:55,070
and they're definitely gonna
pick the Bellas to perform.

1420
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:57,550
So I need to be there
'cause my talent compensates

1421
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:00,075
for the weaker members
of the group, like Beca.

1422
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:01,554
Tomorrow it is.

1423
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:04,155
And you can go
wherever you want to go.

1424
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:05,720
Urban Outfitters?

1425
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:09,436
You gotta think bigger,
Sunshine.

1426
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,318
A Caribbean tour.

1427
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,039
Have you ever been
to Martinique?

1428
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:16,716
Or the, uh...
the Cayman Islands?

1429
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:19,036
The Cayman Islands?
Oh, they're beautiful,

1430
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:21,680
just like my little girl.

1431
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,672
Uh-huh. Right.

1432
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,114
Dad, let me ask you,

1433
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,873
what was your favorite moment
of the show?

1434
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:29,316
Well, there were too many
moments of greatness

1435
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:30,993
from which to choose.

1436
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:33,037
'Cause my favorite part
was the bit

1437
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:34,520
where I sang that duet
with Beca,

1438
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:36,398
and then was on the top
of the pyramid.

1439
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,278
Oh, yeah.

1440
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:40,238
Yeah, you were wonderful
in that part.

1441
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:42,357
God! There was
no pyramid!

1442
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:44,432
And as if I'd be the top.

1443
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:47,433
And I know exactly
what's in the Cayman Islands.

1444
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:49,796
Yeah, I do.
That bank account

1445
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:51,951
that Mum set up for me
on my 13th birthday.

1446
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:54,794
She said it was just a bit
of an allowance, but...

1447
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:58,357
I know she didn't want me
to ever need your dirty money.

1448
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:01,239
How much is even in it anyway?

1449
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:04,313
A hundred and eighty million,
give or take.

1450
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:09,478
When am I gonna learn...

1451
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:11,512
to open my mail?

1452
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:15,718
I'm done with you, Dad.

1453
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:17,678
Forever.

1454
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:20,480
No, no, you're not.

1455
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:23,200
We are done
when I get the money.

1456
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,317
Amy?

1457
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:27,232
Is this man bothering you?

1458
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:29,232
- Yes, he is. Yeah.
- Yeah.

1459
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:31,835
Sir, step away from the Bella.

1460
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:35,516
Patricia, all my accounts
are frozen.

1461
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:38,559
Good-bye, Fergus.

1462
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:42,239
I tried to do this
the nice way, Patricia.

1463
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,630
You remember that!

1464
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:49,633
So, do you know how to do
this? How do you do this?

1465
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:51,518
Pour the water over the sugar,
and smash...

1466
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:52,829
Do you guys know where Beca is?

1467
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:55,152
Theo must have said
something to her by now.

1468
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:56,913
The show's literally tomorrow.

1469
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,231
- I know.
- Guys, if Khaled picks us,

1470
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:01,158
it'll be our last show together.

1471
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,870
Bellas, a toast.

1472
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:06,997
- Ah, a Chloe toast.
- They say that...

1473
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:09,311
home is where the heart is.

1474
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:14,600
But you guys are the homes
that my heart lives in.

1475
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:17,240
I am inside of all of you.

1476
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,600
It feels so good.

1477
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:23,991
Cheers.
Cheers!

1478
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:26,311
Cheers!
Guys, I love you so much.

1479
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,312
I feel like...
Are you hallucinating?

1480
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:31,154
Excuse me.
Uh, are you the Bellas?

1481
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:32,993
Yes.
Oui, monsieur.

1482
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:34,719
- Sí.
- My name is Henri.

1483
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:37,360
Chicago sent me to take you
to the USO reception.

1484
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:38,960
Reception?

1485
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:41,396
Chicago never mentioned
any reception.

1486
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:43,915
Something about an announcement?

1487
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,720
Oh. We won.
Did we win?

1488
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,393
Um, we need to find our friends,

1489
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:50,199
Beca and Fat Amy.

1490
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:53,239
Oh, they are already there
with Chicago.

1491
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:55,312
Oh.
Perfect.

1492
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:58,120
Let's not keep this
handsome Frenchman waiting.

1493
01:02:58,200 --> 01:02:59,429
Let's go. Shotgun!
Ready?

1494
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:00,749
I guess we should go.
Let's go.

1495
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:03,111
Hey, let's go.
Henri?

1496
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,556
Oh, yeah. Whoo!
Sounds like music.

1497
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:08,838
I am Florencia.

01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:50,434
Oh, merci beaucoup, Henri.
Um, are we almost there?

1513
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:52,751
Uh, yes. In fact...

1514
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:54,638
'Cause it feels like
we've been driving forever.

1515
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,234
...we are right here.

1516
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:57,959
Yay! Oh, great!

1517
01:03:58,040 --> 01:03:59,713
I don't know.
I can't lift it.

1518
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:01,439
I can't see.
I can't see anything.

1519
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,079
Why won't the shade go up?
It's, like, stuck.

1520
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:05,038
It's so dark out there.
Can you guys see out yours?

1521
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:08,557
No, I can't see.
Well, this don't seem right.

1522
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:09,960
Maybe we...

1523
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:11,190
Whoa!

1524
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:13,233
What was that?

1525
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:15,676
I don't know. What was
that?

1526
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:18,993
What?

1527
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:22,391
What happened?
Huh?

1528
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:24,073
I don't know.

1529
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,391
Hang on.
You guys, are we...

1530
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:29,040
Are we floating?

1531
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:30,952
Why would we be floating?
What?

1532
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:36,360
Guys?

1533
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:37,840
You guys, I can't open the door.

1534
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:39,400
What? The door's not opening?

1535
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:41,830
It's the old van-ferry
death-trap maneuver.

1536
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:44,037
I should've seen it coming.

1537
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:45,440
Oh, God.
What?

1538
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,751
Open it. Open the door.
Help!

1539
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:48,956
Does anybody's cell phone work?

1540
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:51,077
Where's my cell phone?
No service.

1541
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:52,753
No service. There's nothing.

1542
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:55,309
That's so inconvenient.
Hell's bells!

1543
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:56,834
We could scream
on the count of three.

1544
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:58,639
Okay. One, two, three.

1545
01:04:58,720 --> 01:04:59,995
Help!

1546
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,756
Sir Bounce-a-lot.

1547
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:31,200
- I told you we're through!
- I know.

1548
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:33,710
But there are some people here

1549
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:36,474
who think you should reconsider.

1550
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:39,712
Amy!

1551
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:43,834
How could you?

1552
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:46,800
I swear to God,
if you hurt any one of them,

1553
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:49,992
except for Jessica and Ashley,
I will kill you!

1554
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:51,958
I don't want to
hurt anyone, Patricia.

1555
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:54,635
The only one I wanted was you,
but you weren't with them,

1556
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:56,240
were you?

1557
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:57,993
Oh, well.

1558
01:05:58,080 --> 01:05:59,958
Plan B.

1559
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:02,077
You have 30 minutes.

1560
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:03,799
Come to the boat,

1561
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:06,315
or your friends
swim with the fishes.

1562
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:08,796
And I think you know I mean it.

1563
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:10,792
Oh, I know you mean it.

1564
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:12,599
Because you're a terrible person

1565
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:14,990
that does terrible things.

1566
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:17,390
But there's one thing
you're forgetting, Dad.

1567
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:18,960
I'm your daughter.

1568
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:22,431
Your nightmare blood,
it runs through my veins!

1569
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:24,273
Hey, Amy, um, I need to talk
to you about something.

1570
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:26,636
It's kind of important.
Oh, yeah, just a sec.

1571
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:28,120
I'm on a call.
Okay.

1572
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:29,475
You think you're bad?

1573
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:32,712
You have no idea
what I'm capable of.

1574
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:34,877
I've graduated college.

1575
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:36,599
I could do anything.

1576
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:38,916
So say your prayers,

1577
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,913
'cause Fat Amy is coming...

1578
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,720
for you.

1579
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,553
Now!

1580
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:51,916
So...

1581
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,435
which two of you

1582
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:56,637
are Ashley and Jessica?

1583
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:00,715
- Ah, shit.
- Okay, so...

1584
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:01,995
I have kind of bad news.

1585
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:04,237
Uh, and I know you're
gonna be fine. Uh, I know

1586
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:05,834
everybody's gonna be
fine, but, like...

1587
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:09,074
Oh.

1588
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:12,153
Um, w... well...

1589
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:14,152
We didn't get picked, man.
And you know what?

1590
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:16,709
Like, screw them. It's not,
like, the whole story.

1591
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:19,713
There's... uh, uh, uh...

1592
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:21,712
I don't know, I still feel
like I want to tell you

1593
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:22,790
'cause I think that, like,

1594
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:24,439
secrets are, like,
the worst, right?

1595
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:25,710
So...

1596
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:27,553
Yeah, it's the worst.

1597
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:28,869
Let's go.

1598
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:30,314
Go where?

1599
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:32,750
Don't worry.
We'll change in the cab.

1600
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:39,640
Amy, what are we doing?

1601
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:42,155
Why are we not calling
the police or Chicago?

1602
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:44,118
No cops. There's no time.

1603
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:46,396
And if my dad sees 'em,
he'll take off.

1604
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:47,675
This is serious.

1605
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:49,353
The Bellas
could really get hurt.

1606
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,272
Not on my watch.
Amy, come on.

1607
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:52,953
Look, I know my father.

1608
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:54,554
I know his guys.

1609
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:56,791
Some of them I know,
like, really well.

1610
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:59,076
And I know that boat.

1611
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:00,913
We can do this.

1612
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,117
Okay. What's the plan?

1613
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:05,920
First up, I need you
to pick up the pace.

1614
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,639
This boat's not gonna
row itself.

1615
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:14,952
Okay. That's the ladder
that'll take you

1616
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:16,713
up to the main deck
where the Bellas are.

1617
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,632
Do not let Fergus
hear what I'm doing below.

1618
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:20,632
Okay, giant distraction
coming up.

1619
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:23,315
You sure about this?
Have I ever let you down?

1620
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:26,074
Dozens of examples spring
to mind, if I'm honest.

1621
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:28,157
What? Yeah, you're very unreliable.

1622
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:30,152
It's, like, one of the
hallmarks of your personality.

1623
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:32,516
I don't think we have time
to unpack that right now.

1624
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:34,990
Shh. I'll just
see you up top.

1625
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:36,434
Nobody's gonna
die tonight, right?

1626
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:37,920
Yeah.
Right?

1627
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,798
Yeah.
Well, that doesn't help.

1628
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:41,234
Okay.
Okay, ready?

1629
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:42,913
I've got my serious face on now.

1630
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,639
Okay.
It's time.

1631
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:46,791
Let's do it.

1632
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:50,239
Once we get the money,
we sail directly to Sydney.

1633
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:52,630
Unless she doesn't show.

1634
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:55,280
Then things get ugly.

1635
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:57,232
Ten minutes, ladies.

1636
01:08:57,360 --> 01:08:59,192
Guys, you know
what we should do?

1637
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:01,950
Where did you come from?

1638
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:03,190
What?

1639
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:04,430
You weren't here before.

1640
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:06,432
I've been here the whole time.

1641
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:08,910
I'm just small.

1642
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:18,552
Just... if we only have
ten minutes left,

1643
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:21,838
I say we spend it
doing something we love.

1644
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:26,073
Let's go out like Bellas
and sing one more song.

1645
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:30,960
You want to sing right now?

1646
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:33,236
I think we should sing
one more song, though.

1647
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:35,277
I don't know if I feel like
singing.

1648
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:38,632
Oh, my God. Guys, I
just want to sing so bad.

1649
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:41,994
We really think you'll like it.

1650
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:43,958
You want to entertain me?

1651
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:45,838
Knock yourselves out.

1652
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:47,673
Nine minutes.

1653
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:49,638
Let's make it a loud one, guys.

1654
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:51,518
You are terrible
at reading signals.

Amy!

1710
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:03,838
Hey, you've been a very
naughty girl, Turnip Top!

1711
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,400
Amy! Amy!

1712
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:07,199
Amy!

1713
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:16,790
I rained hellfire!

1714
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:32,709
The MPs arrested Amy's dad.

1715
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:34,433
He's going to jail
for a long time.

1716
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:35,920
I'm gonna go meet them,
all right?

1717
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,400
Sit tight.

1718
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,393
I have no idea
what just happened,

1719
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:42,711
but if Khaled doesn't pick us
after all of that,

1720
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:44,553
what are we doing
with our lives?

1721
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:48,194
Uh, I think Beca has something

1722
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:50,237
she'd like to share
with the group.

1723
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:53,119
Um, thanks, Amy.

1724
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:54,873
Uh, yeah.

1725
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:58,032
I was gonna say something
earlier, but we were involved

1726
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:00,077
in a hostage crisis,
so I just...

1727
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:01,270
They picked her.

1728
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:04,437
DJ Khaled and his team.

1729
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:05,590
They didn't pick the Bellas.

1730
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:07,637
They picked Beca.

1731
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:09,757
So they... yeah,
so they only picked her.

1732
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:12,992
Yeah, but I said no because
I feel exactly how you feel.

1733
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:15,800
You guys are family, and you
don't walk away from family.

1734
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:17,599
Don't you want to make music?

1735
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:19,194
No, I guess, but...

1736
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:21,954
Beca, you can't say no.
You've gotta do it.

1737
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:24,157
Look, your real family
doesn't hold you back.

1738
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:25,913
They lift you up.

1739
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,117
Kind of feel like I've been
saying something to that effect

1740
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:31,634
- the entire time.
- Oh, my God, Emily!

1741
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:34,519
Smart people
are talking right now.

1742
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:36,637
Aubrey, don't, please.

1743
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:38,632
It's... I... I won't do it.
It's not important.

1744
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:40,074
No, no, no.
It's not that.

1745
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:42,834
You know, I have
to be honest with you guys.

1746
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:46,231
Every time I perform
in front of people,

1747
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:48,471
I feel like I'm gonna puke.

1748
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:50,677
And I don't have to anymore.

1749
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:53,480
I'm so happy.

1750
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:55,631
Yes!

1751
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:57,473
No more puking.
Whew!

1752
01:16:57,560 --> 01:16:59,153
- No more puke.
- No more puke.

1753
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:00,560
Yes.

1754
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:02,757
You know what?
I think I might just...

1755
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:06,629
I don't know, move to Mykonos
and become a doula.

1756
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:08,916
A doula?
A birthing coach.

1757
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,957
You gonna coach babies?
Mm-hmm.

1758
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:12,554
Yeah, I'll be like...

1759
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:15,832
"Come here, little guy.
You can do it.

1760
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:17,593
"There ain't really
nothing to it.

1761
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:19,831
"You can do it,
you can do it. Come on!"

1762
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:21,479
- Ah...
- Now that gay people

1763
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:24,200
can serve in the military,
I'm a join the Air Force

1764
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:26,272
and let them pay
for my flight school.

1765
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:30,240
I have my Abnormal Psych exam
coming up next week.

1766
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:32,630
But also, you're gonna
keep writing

1767
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:36,031
so your life isn't filled
with crushing regret, right?

1768
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:37,873
Yes.
Good.

1769
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:39,519
Well, guys, a music career

1770
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:41,637
would interfere
with my business, so...

1771
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:44,673
Yeah, that little tiny
juice truck you work at.

1772
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:45,989
The juice truck I own

1773
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:48,356
and just secured capital
to franchise.

1774
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:50,397
- Huh?
- Uh, what?

1775
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:53,359
I didn't tell you guys?
Congratulations.

1776
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:54,755
Cool beans.

1777
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,354
You talk?

1778
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,916
Satan has finally left my body.

1779
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:04,471
Hi. I'm Esther.

1780
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,950
- Wha...
- I have many questions.

1781
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:09,999
You guys?

1782
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:12,430
I think it's time that we go on

1783
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:14,591
with the next chapter
of our lives.

1784
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:18,230
It's time for us to move on. You know?

1785
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:20,596
I mean, we're always
gonna be there for each other

1786
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:22,672
because we're family.

1787
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:25,190
And, I mean, I, for one,
am very ready.

1788
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:27,556
I got the call that
I got into vet school.

1789
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:29,751
You got in!
Yes, I got in. I know.

1790
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:32,435
No way!
I got in. I'm a vet.

1791
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:34,517
Congratulations!

1792
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:36,239
What about you, Ames?

1793
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:37,913
You sure you're cool with this?

1794
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,116
Are you kidding me?

1795
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:41,510
I just found out
I got $180 million

1796
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:43,592
to put into
"Fat Amy Winehouse."

1797
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:44,909
What?
Yeah.

1798
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:48,391
Wait, I could do more shows.

1799
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:51,632
"Fat Amy Adams."
"Fat Amy Grant."

1800
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:53,234
Oh, that would be good
for Christmas.

1801
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:54,356
Would be great.

1802
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:57,114
- Beca.
- Don't.

1803
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:59,271
I swear to God,
don't make that face.

1804
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:02,353
If you cry, I'm gonna cry. I swear.

1805
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:03,999
I'm not gonna do this
with you today, so...

1806
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:05,434
I'm not doing it.
I hate that face.

1807
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:07,079
I'm not.
Don't make that face.

1808
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:08,719
This is my regular face.

1809
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:10,120
You know how much I love you.

1810
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:14,558
You just get out there,
and you crush it. Okay?

1811
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:16,472
You crush it so hard

1812
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:19,280
that your nips tingle a bit.

1813
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:20,595
She loves hugs.
Don't.

1814
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:22,000
That's not funny.
We should give her one.

1815
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:43,880
Here we are.

1816
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:45,792
The final show, the conclusion

1817
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:49,317
of the USO Tour
in the South of France,

1818
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:51,119
coming to you from the Citadel.

1819
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:54,432
What a gorgeous setting
here tonight under the stars.

1820
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:56,119
Isn't this beautiful?
Doing a wonderful

1821
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:58,237
musical presentation
in a bunker.

1822
01:19:58,320 --> 01:19:59,640
In the South of France.

1823
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:01,313
I mean, it's so romantic here.

1824
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:02,794
I've never been to France.

1825
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:04,234
I hope never to come back.

1826
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:05,919
Oh, no, it's not
a place for you.

1827
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,593
Oh, no, no.
There's no good people here.

1828
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:08,670
No, no.

1829
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:09,876
On your toes, folks.

1830
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:11,997
We're on in ten.
First positions.

1831
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:19,519
Ladies and gentlemen,

1832
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:23,514
let's give it up for DJ Khaled!

1833
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:30,113
When I say "fan,"
you say "love."

1834
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:31,236
Fan!

1835
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:32,549
Love! Fan!

1836
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:33,716
Love!

1837
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:35,075
First of all, I want to thank

1838
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:37,072
all the troops
for coming out here.

1839
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:38,719
It's about you.

1840
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:40,029
We salute you.

1841
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:42,271
We praise you and thank you.

1842
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:44,875
But tonight I have a surprise.

1843
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:49,079
I'll be introducing you
to a new star.

1844
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:50,480
A superstar.

1845
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:53,598
Somebody that I have cosigned.

1846
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:55,990
I introduce you to...

1847
01:20:56,120 --> 01:20:58,237
Beca Mitchell.

1848
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:04,392
And here's Beca Mitchell
stepping onto the stage,

1849
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:07,040
just as small as she was
the day she was born.

1850
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:09,635
You know, we've been following
this little sprite-light lady

1851
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:11,911
for, I don't know,
seven years now, I think.

1852
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,753
We have been showing you

1853
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:16,036
her new life
out in the real world,

1854
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:18,430
where she's out to take
another perfectly good job

1855
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:19,835
from an able-bodied man.

1856
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:22,553

Yeah!

1929
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:48,480
Yeah!
Whoo!

1930
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:50,830
I love you guys so much.

1931
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:02,480
I can't believe we finally
got our big ending.

1932
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:04,791
You got all that
on camera, right, John?

1933
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:06,360
Sure, I did.

1934
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:08,272
This is confusing technology
for a woman.

1935
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:09,919
It's child's play for a man.

1936
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,957
All right, because
the red light was not on,

1937
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:13,599
so I just had to ask.

1938
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:26,195
That was amazing.

1939
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:27,953
You guys, it's like my dad
always says,

1940
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:29,872
"Always give a hundred percent,

1941
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:31,599
"unless you're donating blood

1942
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:33,558
"or getting a divorce."
"Or getting a divorce."

1943
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:37,313
Dad.

1944
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:41,238
Oh, I knew you'd make it.

1945
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:44,519
Punching bag. Go!

1946
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:46,956
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

1947
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:48,952
That's for being late.

1948
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:55,113
Hi. I'm Esther.

1949
01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:58,470
Wow.

1950
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:00,836
You smell like Skittles.
Can I taste the rainbow?

1951
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:02,434
You can definitely
taste the rainbow.

1952
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:04,591
Mm, let's go to it.

1953
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:15,679
Hey. You were great.

1954
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:18,349
- Aw.
- Oh, that's nice.

1955
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:24,477
So you work for me now.
Yeah, you're the boss.

1956
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:26,472
That's cool. Yeah.
I had some ideas, right?

1957
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:28,517
I'm gonna be a real handful,
I gotta tell you.

1958
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:30,193
Oh, I realized that
from the beginning.

1959
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:32,476
Gail.
John.

1960
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:34,319
Who are we kidding?

1961
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:37,560
It's just us.

1962
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:39,472
It's always been just us.

1963
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:43,240
Maybe we should just drop
this facade between us

1964
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:45,352
and speak honestly
about how we feel.

1965
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:46,715
Oh, my.

1966
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:48,314
Gail.

1967
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:49,993
John.

1968
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:51,756
I love you.

1969
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:07,392
We have so much footage.
How are we gonna edit all this?

1970
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:09,278
Well, that's a problem.
You just touch the one button.

1971
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:10,874
No, no, I have to do
a lot of buttons.

1972
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:12,474
You make sure
that the light's on.

1973
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:14,517
I have the lens on. I'm
just... Are you sure?

1974
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:15,960
Well, that about wraps it up.

1975
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:17,872
Let's see what we have
in the can.
