Hi everyone it's me Munkaw!

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,809
Welcome to the land of virtuous boobies.

3
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:38,809
Want know what I'm live steaming today?

4
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:42,059
This flashlight. I'm reviewing
is the first of its kind.

5
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,601
It's unlike any other.

6
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:45,059
This size fits perfectly in your hands,

7
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:46,892
and you can even - here...

8
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:48,184
I'll show you.

9
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:50,999
You don't need to hold it.
You can just put it in your mouth.

10
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,476
If you want it,

11
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,392
type it here,

12
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:56,707
comment below, I'll reply.

13
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:58,934
Let's see the comments.

14
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:01,267
Is anyone interested?

15
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:03,017
"Boobs or babies heads?"

16
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:05,101
Why are the comments about boobs?

17
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:07,809
I'm selling flashlights, pay attention.

18
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:09,392

19

Munkaw the online prostitute.

20
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:13,809
How do you know I'm a prostitute?

21
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:15,434
Usually I don't charge,

22
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:17,559
I even give them money for the taxi home.

23
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:19,267
If anyone is rude again,

24
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:20,892
I'm gonna block them,

25
00:01:20,916 --> 00:01:22,767
and you won't get to see anymore boobs.

26
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:23,976
This is a warning.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,165
"Online prostitute?"

28
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:28,809
"Monica: If you block me you'll die."

29
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:29,892
Who the heck?

30
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:31,624
You think I'm scared?

31
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:33,559
I'll slap you with my boobs.

32
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:35,767
Funny. Hilarious.

33
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:38,207
You rude comments on school break?

34
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:40,457
Let's see your name so I can block you.

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,582
Mo-Ni-ca.

36
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,726
If you're gonna mess around.

37
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,517
At least have some respect,

38
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:49,351
don't use a dead person's name.

39
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:50,892
Don't be so funny.

40
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:51,915
Blocked.

41
00:01:56,833 --> 00:02:00,124
"Unable to block Monica."

42
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:13,249
"Monica: I am behind you."

43
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:28,915
"Unable to block Monica."

44
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:06,374
Here.

45
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:38,499
Top Seller. Isn't that quite a hard sell?

46
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:40,184
No,

47
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:41,707
we're a business.

"True beauty comes from
within, cream ICON NIC"

49
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,726
Okay, let's move on to the next stage,

50
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,559
we've already prepared
the other vegetables,

51
00:03:56,583 --> 00:04:00,624
and I'll slice the carrots
to add some color to the dish.

52
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:06,976
Now, we're in the carrot preparation stage,

53
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,059
to... add a bit of color.

54
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,290
Okay. Done.

55
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,332
While waiting for the water to boil,

56
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,309
let's read some comments.

57
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:18,124
How are you Sa? Are you well?

58
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,415
I'm good.

59
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:23,267
What facial cream do you use?
It's so bright.

60
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:24,684
Oh, thank you.

61
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,790
Of course I use ICON NIC!

62
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:29,809
The cream that Net Idols trust.

63
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:31,665
Gotta advertise a bit.

64
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:35,957
"Monica tagged Malisa."

65
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,767
Ah... Okay.

66
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,559
The water is boiling,

67
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:45,540
now I can put the prepared
ingredients into the pot.

70
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:26,874
Gives me goosebumps.

71
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:31,082
Who uses a dead person's account
to play a practical joke?

72
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,124
Hmm...

73
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,351
I'm not over-thinking,

74
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,540
I just... feel strange.

75
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,249
Just hurry home, yeah?

76
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:01,332
Bye.

80
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:38,707
What's wrong?

81
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,415
What's wrong, Sa?

82
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,332
Who's Monica?

83
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,684
Just a Net Idol,

84
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,999
who I hired to review the cream.

85
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:56,415
It was still a Malisza brand back then.

86
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:59,517
Oh... She must've been very daring,

87
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,665
live streaming her suicide.

88
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:08,017
She was probably very stressed.

89
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,790
She broke up with her boyfriend.

90
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,582
People don't like her. A
lot of them hate her.

91
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:21,707
I think someone must have
hacked into her account to mess with you.

92
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,915
If you're worried,

93
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,040
just block her.

94
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:30,915
Yes?

95

I was surprised too.

I wonder who would do something so shitty.

I don't know.

Even I was her friend and I don't know.

162
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:43,957
If you really wanna know,
why don't you go look in her apartment?

163
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,415
You can take me in?

164
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:51,624
Yeah... I guess,

165
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:53,290
but...

166
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:54,957
umm...

167
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:11,165

00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,665
Come eat here sometime when you're free.

174
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:49,309
Sa, why have you brought me here?

175
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:51,915
I didn't want to come alone.

176
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:21,207
Is every Net Idol's room this messy?

177
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:25,124
Were you like this?

178
00:24:31,791 --> 00:24:33,040
Let's hurry.

179
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:35,124
I don't want to stay long.

180
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:37,124
Then...

181
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:39,249
I'll go look in the computer.

182
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:22,374
"Monica's birthday, 18th August 1997."

183
00:25:33,916 --> 00:25:36,249
18...

184
00:26:03,541 --> 00:26:06,999
Mo... Ni... ca...

185
00:26:12,916 --> 00:26:14,207
Jak...
Yeah?

186
00:26:14,583 --> 00:26:15,976
Try typing Malika.

187
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,059
Her real name.

188
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:18,415
Oh...

189
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:22,957
Ma... Li... ka...

190
00:26:22,958 --> 00:26:23,874
"Wrong password."

191
00:26:35,958 --> 00:26:37,165
Ignore it.

192
00:26:38,458 --> 00:26:39,957
Let's find her phone?

193
00:26:40,625 --> 00:26:41,624
Sure.

194
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,499
Sa.

195
00:27:16,833 --> 00:27:17,749
Yes?

196
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:19,290
I found it.

197
00:27:22,333 --> 00:27:23,476
Can you turn it on?

198
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,351
It won't turn on?

199
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:25,267
Hmm.

200
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:26,749
Need to charge.

201
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:49,707
Jak.

202
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:51,832
I think we should leave.

203
00:27:52,416 --> 00:27:53,415
Sure.

204
00:28:03,833 --> 00:28:04,915
Sa!

205
00:28:07,166 --> 00:28:08,226
Sa!

206
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:09,540
What's wrong Sa?

207
00:28:10,375 --> 00:28:11,790
It's me, Sa.

208
00:28:14,375 --> 00:28:15,832
What's wrong baby?

209
00:28:16,916 --> 00:28:18,082
Sa.

210
00:28:21,041 --> 00:28:22,332
It's okay.

211
00:28:42,666 --> 00:28:45,082
You should stay off social media for a bit.

212
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:49,624
What are you going to
do with Monica's phone?

213
00:28:50,791 --> 00:28:52,790
Well there's a password on it.

214
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:55,707
I'll have my friend hack it tomorrow.

215
00:28:56,625 --> 00:28:57,999
So we can find out...

216
00:28:58,916 --> 00:29:00,540
Who's been messing with you.

217
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,999
So you won't have to stress.

218
00:29:02,166 --> 00:29:04,832
But what if it's not
someone messing with me.

219
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:11,999
You're over-thinking.

220
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:21,101
I'm gonna go check on the factory first,

221
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:22,540
I'll hurry home.

222
00:30:18,166 --> 00:30:21,040
"Net Idol's gruesome death."

223
00:34:14,791 --> 00:34:15,874
Yes mom.

224
00:34:16,208 --> 00:34:17,207
Yep.

225
00:34:18,166 --> 00:34:19,165
Ah, yes.

226
00:34:21,708 --> 00:34:23,249
I'm sorry mom.

227
00:34:23,916 --> 00:34:24,999
Yes.

228
00:34:25,708 --> 00:34:26,790
Yes.

229
00:34:27,083 --> 00:34:29,790
I'm taking good care of her.

230
00:34:31,416 --> 00:34:32,415
Yes.

231
00:34:33,833 --> 00:34:35,540
I'll tell you if anything comes up.

232
00:34:36,791 --> 00:34:38,457
Yes, okay.

233
00:34:38,916 --> 00:34:39,851
Yes mom.

234
00:34:39,875 --> 00:34:40,874
Yep.

235
00:34:41,458 --> 00:34:42,457
Bye mom.

236
00:34:56,416 --> 00:34:57,582
How are you?

237
00:35:52,291 --> 00:35:53,642
Right this way, Mr. Jak.

238
00:35:53,666 --> 00:35:54,499
Yes.

239
00:35:57,041 --> 00:35:58,582
You have a shoot today?

240
00:35:58,958 --> 00:36:02,124
Yes sir, a cute and sexy one.

241
00:36:02,458 --> 00:36:05,457
But recently Sa hasn't
been hiring me at all.

242
00:36:05,708 --> 00:36:08,892
All my models are fit and attractive,

243
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,374
and most importantly,

244
00:36:10,541 --> 00:36:12,142
they have lots of followers.

245
00:36:12,166 --> 00:36:14,642
If you're interested in
anyone, just tell me.

246
00:36:14,666 --> 00:36:16,415
I'll arrange it for you.

247
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:18,226
Deweii, today,

248
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:20,040
let's just cut to the chase.

249
00:36:20,333 --> 00:36:22,374
I came to talk about Monica.

250
00:36:31,125 --> 00:36:33,082
I never believed in ghosts,

251
00:36:35,125 --> 00:36:37,499
but this whole thing has
gotten out of hand.

252
00:36:40,833 --> 00:36:42,832
Som, Sa's old staff,

253
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:46,790
also died after getting
tagged in the video.

254
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:49,915
Most recently was Monica's friend.

255
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:51,851
Suddenly she started hallucinating,

256
00:36:51,875 --> 00:36:53,915
before getting hit by a car.

257
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:57,415
You were tagged in that video as well.

258
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,457
Don't you think it's strange?

259
00:37:10,416 --> 00:37:13,457
I want to know what happened
before Monica died.

260
00:37:15,541 --> 00:37:17,249
You were her manager.

261
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,874
You should know best.

262
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:24,790
I'm not psychic.

263
00:37:25,291 --> 00:37:28,767
But if you're asking why
she killed herself,

264
00:37:28,791 --> 00:37:31,749
then I know just as much as you.

265
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,351
Oh...

266
00:37:37,375 --> 00:37:39,749
Why don't you ask Sun, her ex-boyfriend.

267
00:37:41,708 --> 00:37:44,540
He was also tagged in the post.

268
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,665
And he was much closer
to Monica than I was.

269
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:49,540
Try asking him.

270
00:38:01,208 --> 00:38:02,749
Is he the guy called...

271
00:38:03,875 --> 00:38:05,374
Tawan Biker?

272
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,017
Oh, yes. Go ask him,

273
00:38:09,041 --> 00:38:11,832
I have to go take care
of the models on set.

274
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,082
Deweii,

275
00:38:17,458 --> 00:38:20,165
You didn't do anything bad to Monica right?

276
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:24,392
Are you crazy, Mr Jak?

277
00:38:24,416 --> 00:38:26,707
Monica was my golden child!

278
00:38:26,875 --> 00:38:28,790
Why would I do anything?

279
00:38:29,458 --> 00:38:31,624
Anyways, I have to excuse myself,

280
00:38:32,208 --> 00:38:33,290
Bye!

281
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,642
Hi! Hello everyone,

282
00:38:41,666 --> 00:38:43,665
It's me, Lod Chong.

283
00:38:43,833 --> 00:38:46,707
I'm here to film a commercial today.

284
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:50,082
Look, I've come with a pretty girl too.

285
00:38:50,291 --> 00:38:52,665
I'm gonna show you around okay?

286
00:38:56,291 --> 00:38:57,540
Oh.

287
00:38:58,041 --> 00:38:59,559
Can you start working?

288
00:38:59,583 --> 00:39:01,457
Or are you waiting for me to bitch first?

289
00:39:01,583 --> 00:39:04,624
After work, you can go "Like"
while you pee and shit.

290
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,207
Okay.

291
00:39:10,583 --> 00:39:12,642
Hi everyone!

292
00:39:12,666 --> 00:39:14,999
Make sure you check out our work!

293
00:39:15,625 --> 00:39:16,915
Huh. This bitch.

294
00:39:18,583 --> 00:39:20,226
Hi everyone!

295
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:23,184
I have to excuse these girls
so they can go work.

296
00:39:23,208 --> 00:39:25,809
They can continue live streaming
once they're done.

297
00:39:25,833 --> 00:39:27,499
Bye!

298
00:39:28,416 --> 00:39:29,309
Take it.

299
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:33,226
No, now they're all gonna unfollow me.

300
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:36,124
Let them know, there is time for work,
then time for play.

301
00:39:39,541 --> 00:39:42,040
Oh yeah, where did Munkaw go?

302
00:39:42,458 --> 00:39:44,124
Shh! Why are you so loud?

303
00:39:44,875 --> 00:39:46,476
She got hired to review a flashlight,

304
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,457
and it pays well.

305
00:39:47,625 --> 00:39:49,374
So I let her go do that first.

306
00:39:49,541 --> 00:39:52,624
How come we don't get jobs like that too?

307
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:54,684
If you wreck this one
will there be another one?

308
00:39:54,708 --> 00:39:55,707
Go work.

309
00:39:56,958 --> 00:39:57,957
Go!

310
00:39:58,458 --> 00:39:59,457
Go work!

311
00:40:02,708 --> 00:40:04,184
Okay everyone!

312
00:40:04,208 --> 00:40:06,207
The girls are ready.

313
00:40:06,833 --> 00:40:08,726
Okay, can we get some strong poses.

314
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:09,874
Don't move.

315
00:40:12,166 --> 00:40:13,434
Beautiful.

316
00:40:13,458 --> 00:40:14,957
Show some confidence.

317
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:19,017
Great.

318
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,707
Great girls!

319
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,374
Very pretty.

320
00:40:23,583 --> 00:40:25,207
This photo's good.

321
00:40:25,333 --> 00:40:27,142
More confidence Lod Chong. More confidence.

322
00:40:27,166 --> 00:40:30,726
Oh no. Watch your arms! This photo's
almost good. Watch your arms.

323
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:32,082
Beautiful. Good.

324
00:40:32,458 --> 00:40:34,249
A bit more cheerful please.

325
00:40:35,916 --> 00:40:38,351
Your eyes are perfect, just open them more.

326
00:40:38,375 --> 00:40:40,749
Okay, let's swap the positions around.

327
00:40:43,083 --> 00:40:45,124
Amazing!

328
00:40:45,583 --> 00:40:47,332
This is great.

329
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:49,832
Good job. Good job.

330
00:40:50,666 --> 00:40:52,309
Okay. We got it?
Yes.

331
00:40:52,333 --> 00:40:53,059
Okay.

332
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:54,726
Okay everyone, that's a wrap.

333
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:56,665
We can pack up!

334
00:40:58,791 --> 00:41:00,892
Thank you very much. Thanks everyone.

335
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:02,540
See you on the next job.

336
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:09,165
Are you girls not doing home?

337
00:41:09,958 --> 00:41:11,332
You can pack up now.

338
00:41:12,833 --> 00:41:13,749
Go.

339
00:41:24,541 --> 00:41:25,707
Hello.

340
00:41:26,125 --> 00:41:27,707
See you later!

341
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,415
My whole body hurts.

342
00:41:34,041 --> 00:41:35,374
Do you wanna go out?

343
00:41:36,416 --> 00:41:37,415
No thanks.

344
00:41:38,416 --> 00:41:40,499
I'm tired, wanna go home.

345
00:41:40,708 --> 00:41:41,874
Okay.

346
00:41:46,416 --> 00:41:47,749
To be honest,

347
00:41:49,291 --> 00:41:51,726
Munkaw is like Deweii's favourite right?

348
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:54,165
He gives her all the good jobs.

349
00:41:55,833 --> 00:41:59,415
Weren't all three of us
supposed to get the flashlight job?

350
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:01,665
She took it all herself.

351
00:42:01,791 --> 00:42:02,790
Bitch.

352
00:42:04,333 --> 00:42:06,290
Oh, come on.

353
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:10,040
Maybe the client only wanted her.

354
00:42:14,416 --> 00:42:16,040
If Mo hadn't died first,

355
00:42:16,583 --> 00:42:17,707
don't even dream,

356
00:42:17,958 --> 00:42:19,624
that Munkaw would've gotten this job.

357
00:42:41,875 --> 00:42:43,457
Who the hell messaged the group?

358
00:42:46,916 --> 00:42:48,249
Shit.

359
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,749
Hello.

360
00:42:52,958 --> 00:42:54,207
Yes ma'am.

361
00:42:54,541 --> 00:42:55,874
Of course!

362
00:42:56,083 --> 00:42:58,851
Thank you so much, you're so sweet.

363
00:42:58,875 --> 00:43:01,165
Always hiring our girls.

364
00:43:03,583 --> 00:43:04,707
Yes.

365
00:43:04,708 --> 00:43:05,559
Yes.

366
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:08,374
It will be the price we already agreed on.

367
00:43:08,875 --> 00:43:09,767
No problem.

368
00:43:09,791 --> 00:43:13,309
And on the day,
we'll take care of hair and makeup for you.

369
00:43:13,333 --> 00:43:14,642
Yes ma'am.

370
00:43:14,666 --> 00:43:16,915
Yes. So you can confirm the...?

371
00:43:41,291 --> 00:43:42,915
Let's go.

372
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:51,415
Why the...

373
00:43:52,625 --> 00:43:53,624
Excuse me!

374
00:43:54,041 --> 00:43:55,707
Is there anyone there?

375
00:43:57,625 --> 00:43:59,184
Is there anyone there?

376
00:43:59,208 --> 00:44:01,059
We can't open the door.

377
00:44:01,083 --> 00:44:02,332
Please open it.

378
00:44:03,291 --> 00:44:05,165
What the fuck. I can't open it.

379
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,124
Is anyone outside?

380
00:44:13,958 --> 00:44:15,290
Bunsai!

381
00:44:16,166 --> 00:44:17,582
Where are you?

382
00:44:18,791 --> 00:44:19,999
I can't see!

383
00:44:23,708 --> 00:44:24,707
Bunsai!

384
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:31,249
Where are you? Answer me!

385
00:44:33,541 --> 00:44:36,249
Bunsai! Where are you?

386
00:44:44,291 --> 00:44:45,290
Bunsai!

387
00:44:47,625 --> 00:44:48,707
Bunsai!

388
00:44:51,041 --> 00:44:52,374
Where are you?

389
00:44:53,958 --> 00:44:55,165
Bunsai!

390
00:44:55,875 --> 00:44:57,874
Bunsai are you there?

391
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:12,767
Open! Open the door please!

392
00:45:12,791 --> 00:45:14,726
Anyone please open the door!

393
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:16,184
Open the door please!

394
00:45:16,208 --> 00:45:17,267
Open the door!

395
00:45:17,291 --> 00:45:20,332
Open the door! Open it please!

396
00:45:27,666 --> 00:45:30,540
Open the door! Open the door!

397
00:47:03,083 --> 00:47:04,624
People are watching.

398
00:47:05,375 --> 00:47:06,707
What people?

399
00:47:13,208 --> 00:47:15,540
You're crazy. Go be with Kont.

400
00:47:18,291 --> 00:47:19,665
Hey!

401
00:47:33,208 --> 00:47:34,540
She gets shy?

402
00:47:46,291 --> 00:47:47,582
Excuse me.

403
00:47:49,458 --> 00:47:50,749
Yes?

404
00:47:54,625 --> 00:47:56,749
Sun. Someone's here to see you.

405
00:48:04,125 --> 00:48:06,249
Well, I'm gonna go inside first.

406
00:48:08,666 --> 00:48:09,457
Hello.

407
00:48:10,458 --> 00:48:11,957
What's up?

408
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:15,499
I want to speak to you about Monica.

409
00:48:16,833 --> 00:48:18,457
What about Monica?

410
00:48:20,916 --> 00:48:23,665
You know the post that
Monica tagged you in?

411
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,915
My girlfriend was also tagged in that.

412
00:48:28,666 --> 00:48:32,165
Sorry but who is your girlfriend?

413
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:35,457
She once hired Monica
to review her cream, Malisza's cream.

414
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,332
So I want to find out,

415
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:40,790
if these two were ever
conflicted in any way.

416
00:48:42,916 --> 00:48:44,707
Don't even call it conflict.

417
00:48:46,208 --> 00:48:48,124
Because isn't Monica's death,

418
00:48:49,458 --> 00:48:51,082
your girlfriend's fault?

419
00:48:56,166 --> 00:48:58,124
You listen to me.

420
00:48:59,708 --> 00:49:01,582
This is my girlfriend's house.

421
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:03,642
I don't have any reason,

422
00:49:03,666 --> 00:49:05,582
to be discussing the past with you,

423
00:49:06,666 --> 00:49:08,207
and I don't want to.

424
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:13,082
I think you should go home
and ask your girlfriend,

425
00:49:13,875 --> 00:49:16,415
because that bitch knows best.

426
00:49:17,875 --> 00:49:19,082
Excuse me.

427
00:49:30,458 --> 00:49:31,999
I think you should leave now.

428
00:52:15,291 --> 00:52:17,165
Why did Monica kill herself?

429
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,999
Why are you asking me?

430
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:29,749
Sa.

431
00:52:31,375 --> 00:52:33,249
Why are you hiding things from me?

432
00:52:35,833 --> 00:52:37,832
I'm trying to help you.

433
00:53:29,625 --> 00:53:33,415
Chug! Chug! Chug! More! More! More!

434
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:47,392
Hey! Welcome to my house party!

435
00:53:47,416 --> 00:53:49,226
Today I'm bringing you along to see,

436
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:50,601
how wild the party is!

437
00:53:50,625 --> 00:53:52,790
Hey guys, say hello!

438
00:53:55,208 --> 00:53:56,892
Tell everyone who's not here to come quick!

439
00:53:56,916 --> 00:53:58,540
Tell them to hurry up!

440
00:53:59,166 --> 00:54:02,559
Hey! Look, boom, boom,
boom, are not here yet.

441
00:54:02,583 --> 00:54:04,809
Look at how wild everyone is.
I'll drink for you.

442
00:54:04,833 --> 00:54:07,142
I'm telling you now,
we party without limits here.

443
00:54:07,166 --> 00:54:09,934
We got everything, lights, color, music.

444
00:54:09,958 --> 00:54:13,124
Well it's my house so
it's gotta be fun. Right?

445
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:16,749
Keep going, keep going!
Make everyone jealous!

446
00:54:27,458 --> 00:54:30,540
Sun, what's wrong? You look bored.

447
00:54:31,666 --> 00:54:32,809
I'm not bored.

448
00:54:32,833 --> 00:54:34,207
Is my party not fun?

449
00:54:34,458 --> 00:54:35,434
It's fun.

450
00:54:35,458 --> 00:54:37,290
Really?
Really.

451
00:56:41,166 --> 00:56:42,582
What were you doing?

452
00:56:44,916 --> 00:56:47,165
Must be feeling good now!

453
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:09,874
Sun!

454
00:57:10,083 --> 00:57:11,832
Sun, what's wrong with you?

455
00:57:13,583 --> 00:57:15,332
Sun. Sun!

456
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:18,082
It's me!

457
00:57:20,166 --> 00:57:22,540
Sun! It's me, Koi!

458
00:57:23,208 --> 00:57:24,624
Sun what's wrong?

459
00:57:30,666 --> 00:57:31,874
Don't come closer!

460
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,124
Don't come closer! I
said don't come closer!

461
00:57:34,416 --> 00:57:36,165
Don't fucking come closer!

462
00:57:36,291 --> 00:57:38,226
This is koi!

463
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:39,374
I told you...

464
00:57:59,875 --> 00:58:01,999
Sun stop that! What are you doing?

465
00:58:02,416 --> 00:58:03,915
Sun, stop!

466
00:58:04,375 --> 00:58:05,540
Sun!

467
00:58:08,166 --> 00:58:10,040
Stop acting crazy Sun!

468
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:13,832
Sun Stop!

469
00:58:18,458 --> 00:58:19,749
Stop!

470
00:58:20,416 --> 00:58:21,457
Sun!

471
00:58:21,958 --> 00:58:22,999
Sun!

472
00:58:24,625 --> 00:58:25,957
Sun!

473
00:58:58,666 --> 00:59:00,582
You went to Monica's room?

474
00:59:02,208 --> 00:59:04,124
You should return her things.

475
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,892
Monica has been through enough already.

476
00:59:07,916 --> 00:59:09,624
Let's get to the point.

477
00:59:10,375 --> 00:59:11,874
Why are you here?

478
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:17,207
I want to know the same
thing you want to know.

479
00:59:17,916 --> 00:59:19,832
And I think your girlfriend,

480
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:21,999
can give us the answers.

481
00:59:24,583 --> 00:59:25,749
Sa,

482
00:59:26,833 --> 00:59:29,082
the five people tagged in that post,

483
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,790
have died. You know that right?

484
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:36,999
Aren't you scared you could be next?

485
00:59:45,583 --> 00:59:46,915
Last year...

486
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:50,165
when I first started Malisza brand,

487
00:59:50,791 --> 00:59:53,249
I contacted a Net Idol

488
00:59:53,791 --> 00:59:56,582
to review my products

489
01:00:01,583 --> 01:00:04,184
I'm very proud to present
this girl, Ms. Sa.

490
01:00:04,208 --> 01:00:06,457
Gets good jobs, lots of followers.

491
01:00:06,708 --> 01:00:09,749
I guarantee, she will not disappoint.

492
01:00:14,833 --> 01:00:18,226
Hello, today I'm going to
review the face cream by Malisza.

493
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:19,999
It's this one.

494
01:00:20,291 --> 01:00:22,832
This is the box,

495
01:00:23,458 --> 01:00:25,249
and the container it comes,

496
01:00:26,833 --> 01:00:28,101
looks like this.

497
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:30,559
So it comes in a white and silver package,

498
01:00:30,583 --> 01:00:33,165
and the logo is pink.

499
01:00:33,916 --> 01:00:35,582
Let's take a look inside.

500
01:00:41,333 --> 01:00:44,309
The cream itself is white,

501
01:00:44,333 --> 01:00:47,851
umm... there's no smell,
it's probably fragrance free,

502
01:00:47,875 --> 01:00:49,624
but it doesn't smell bad.

503
01:00:50,583 --> 01:00:53,915
And here's a test on the back of my hand.

504
01:00:55,458 --> 01:00:58,332
You can see that it's pretty easy to apply.

505
01:00:58,666 --> 01:01:00,851
It's not too white,

506
01:01:00,875 --> 01:01:04,290
so it doesn't jump out on your skin.

507
01:01:06,041 --> 01:01:08,059
I'll try it on my face, so we can see

508
01:01:08,083 --> 01:01:09,874
how it is when applied,

509
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:14,457
whether it's different from
our natural skin without cream.

510
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,142
Hmm... I think I like it,

511
01:01:20,166 --> 01:01:23,476
because it's quite soft,

512
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:27,165
and light and easy to apply.

513
01:01:28,875 --> 01:01:31,540
So here... let's compare.

514
01:01:31,541 --> 01:01:32,809
This is with,

515
01:01:32,833 --> 01:01:34,457
This is without.

516
01:01:34,958 --> 01:01:36,892
You can see that the color
is barely different.

517
01:01:36,916 --> 01:01:39,082
It really sinks into your skin.

518
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:41,517
This makes it easy for
people who wear makeup.

519
01:01:41,541 --> 01:01:43,059
Anyways, don't forget to stay tuned,

520
01:01:43,083 --> 01:01:45,915
to my 20 day challenge,
using Malisza's cream.

521
01:01:46,166 --> 01:01:47,499
Bye bye!

522
01:02:23,416 --> 01:02:25,642
So, it's been a week,

523
01:02:25,666 --> 01:02:28,207
where I've been using Malisza's cream.

524
01:02:28,541 --> 01:02:30,476
The package looks like this,

525
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:31,892
for anyone who hasn't seen it.

526
01:02:31,916 --> 01:02:33,017
"Let me see your face clearly"

527
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:34,642
First of all I have to say,

528
01:02:34,666 --> 01:02:36,934
I've tried using Malisza's cream,

529
01:02:36,958 --> 01:02:40,934
and I feel it makes my face much softer,

530
01:02:40,958 --> 01:02:43,017
brightens it up,

531
01:02:43,041 --> 01:02:45,790
and makes makeup stays on a lot longer.

532
01:02:46,375 --> 01:02:48,374
Other than this I have to say,

533
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:50,726
like I've said in earlier clips,

534
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:53,415
Malisza's cream is fragrance free,

535
01:02:53,666 --> 01:02:57,249
so it is suitable for sensitive skin,

536
01:02:57,458 --> 01:02:59,642
"Cutie, kinda weird".

537
01:02:59,666 --> 01:03:02,517
"Liar, She has so much
foundation on, I knew it."

538
01:03:02,541 --> 01:03:05,726
Anyway, let's wait to find out,

539
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:08,226
after I complete the challenge,

540
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:12,517
how much whiter, brighter, better,

541
01:03:12,541 --> 01:03:13,582
and more...

542
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:17,059
interesting my skin
will be after this 20 day challenge,

543
01:03:17,083 --> 01:03:19,082
by Malisza cream.

544
01:03:27,625 --> 01:03:29,082
Hello Som,

545
01:03:29,416 --> 01:03:31,540
Something's happened to my face.

546
01:03:32,125 --> 01:03:34,374
Can you please speak to Malisa?

547
01:03:34,541 --> 01:03:39,165
Tell her to pay me please,
so I can get my face fixed.

548
01:03:40,958 --> 01:03:43,101
Hey, so we're back with me, Mo.

549
01:03:43,125 --> 01:03:44,934
So today is the last day,

550
01:03:44,958 --> 01:03:48,499
of the 20 day challenge by Malisza's brand.

551
01:03:48,875 --> 01:03:52,892
So, I've been using this cream for 20 days.

552
01:03:52,916 --> 01:03:54,851
"Not fun today. Go die ghost face."
I have to say, it's really fantastic.

553
01:03:54,875 --> 01:03:58,124
It's so good it's fucked up my face.

554
01:03:58,375 --> 01:04:00,767
Here, I'll review it for you all to see,

555
01:04:00,791 --> 01:04:02,101
one more time.

556
01:04:02,125 --> 01:04:04,749
Let's see how we apply this cream.

557
01:04:06,291 --> 01:04:08,582
You have to put it on like this.

558
01:04:09,083 --> 01:04:11,726
It makes your face so soft,

559
01:04:11,750 --> 01:04:13,601
and extremely hydrated.

560
01:04:13,625 --> 01:04:15,976
No more break outs and poor skin.

561
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,517
No allergic reactions.

562
01:04:17,541 --> 01:04:21,624
Nothing can give you an allergic reaction.

563
01:04:21,958 --> 01:04:24,559
It's suitable for very sensitive skin.

564
01:04:24,583 --> 01:04:28,392
"Hurry up and die
so you don't become a burden to your kids."

565
01:04:28,416 --> 01:04:30,040
It works so well.

566
01:04:30,166 --> 01:04:32,582
Don't forget to go buy it.

567
01:04:32,833 --> 01:04:34,665
Malisza's brand.

568
01:04:35,791 --> 01:04:37,017
Buy lots and lots!

569
01:04:37,041 --> 01:04:38,559
Because using this cream

570
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:41,040
will fuck your face up!

571
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:16,309
"I'm going to cancel the job for now"

572
01:05:16,333 --> 01:05:18,101
"We don't want you anymore"

573
01:05:18,125 --> 01:05:19,915
"We're no longer hiring you"

574
01:05:33,333 --> 01:05:35,749
Thank you for watching!

575
01:05:53,208 --> 01:05:55,332
"Big shock today, Exciting!"

576
01:05:55,916 --> 01:05:58,290
"What the fuck possessed you?"

577
01:05:58,666 --> 01:06:01,582
"ls no one calling the police?"

578
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,207
You might think that I'm cruel,

579
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:22,915
but what evidence do you have,

580
01:06:24,166 --> 01:06:27,332
that shows my cream ruined her face?

581
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,374
What about everyone else
who was tagged in the post?

582
01:06:33,583 --> 01:06:35,415
What do they have to do with it?

583
01:06:36,916 --> 01:06:38,874
There has to be a reason, Sa.

584
01:06:40,041 --> 01:06:42,249
Why Monica hurt them all as well.

585
01:06:45,041 --> 01:06:46,582
What can I do?

586
01:06:48,208 --> 01:06:51,332
What can I do to make
Monica stop harassing us?

587
01:06:52,125 --> 01:06:53,749
Should I die?

588
01:06:55,416 --> 01:06:57,832
I don't know about the
others who were tagged,

589
01:06:58,875 --> 01:07:00,207
but if I were you,

590
01:07:01,833 --> 01:07:04,457
I think Monica's convinced,

591
01:07:05,375 --> 01:07:07,749
that your cream is the cause,

592
01:07:09,250 --> 01:07:10,999
of all the bad things that happened.

593
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:12,457
And I agree.

594
01:07:13,291 --> 01:07:15,332
So what? You want me to apologize?

595
01:07:15,666 --> 01:07:17,457
Sorry! I'm sorry!

596
01:07:17,958 --> 01:07:19,874
If saying sorry will end this,

597
01:07:20,541 --> 01:07:23,207
no matter how I say it,
they're already dead.

598
01:07:23,375 --> 01:07:24,749
Monica died,

599
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:28,540
because she was attacked by people online,

600
01:07:29,791 --> 01:07:31,790
and your cream was the reason.

601
01:07:33,291 --> 01:07:34,832
If I were Monica,

602
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:39,290
I would want justice as well,
for the things that have happened.

603
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,249
So what?

604
01:07:42,708 --> 01:07:45,790
You want me to announce "live",
that my cream is shit?

605
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,040
That it ruined her face,
until she committed suicide?

606
01:07:49,458 --> 01:07:52,249
I'll do it. If it will end this.

607
01:07:53,416 --> 01:07:55,267
But how can you be sure,

608
01:07:55,291 --> 01:07:58,707
that after I do it, Monica will stop?

609
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:26,290
Sa.

610
01:08:34,708 --> 01:08:35,707
Sa.

611
01:08:37,958 --> 01:08:38,874
Sa.

612
01:09:23,166 --> 01:09:24,540
What are you thinking?

613
01:09:27,375 --> 01:09:29,040
I'm not sure about this.

614
01:09:31,875 --> 01:09:34,082
I don't know what will happen,

615
01:09:35,041 --> 01:09:37,082
if we tell everyone about this.

616
01:09:38,291 --> 01:09:41,707
Sa, you should worry about
yourself right now.

617
01:09:42,291 --> 01:09:46,017
Even if you don't sell the cream
I can take care of you

618
01:09:46,041 --> 01:09:47,207
Right?

619
01:09:51,208 --> 01:09:54,040
How about this. Let's go end this,

620
01:09:55,083 --> 01:09:57,351
and we can start over afterwards.

621
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:58,374
Okay?

622
01:10:01,541 --> 01:10:02,707
Very good.

623
01:10:22,625 --> 01:10:23,624
Jak,

624
01:10:27,541 --> 01:10:29,165
I don't wanna go up.

625
01:10:29,333 --> 01:10:30,707
Then you wait down here.

626
01:10:30,875 --> 01:10:33,124
I'll return Monica's phone to her room.

627
01:13:20,916 --> 01:13:26,934
And the money for reviewing
Malisza's cream, when will I get it?

628
01:13:26,958 --> 01:13:30,665
What are you gonna get?
Your face is so ruined,

629
01:13:30,875 --> 01:13:33,124
You didn't complete the campaign
as stated in the contract.

630
01:13:33,125 --> 01:13:34,726
They didn't sue us,

631
01:13:34,750 --> 01:13:37,040
you should be bowing down to them.

632
01:13:38,166 --> 01:13:40,540
But I can't continue the review,

633
01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:42,457
because of her cream.

634
01:13:42,666 --> 01:13:44,457
Using it has ruined my face!

635
01:13:44,916 --> 01:13:46,665
Can't you see?

636
01:13:46,958 --> 01:13:48,124
Dewii

637
01:13:48,875 --> 01:13:49,957
Dewii

638
01:13:51,750 --> 01:13:53,540
Som, you know right?

639
01:13:53,791 --> 01:13:56,249
That I've been reviewing Malisza's cream.

640
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:57,226
Yes.

641
01:13:57,250 --> 01:13:59,101
My face is ruined.

642
01:13:59,125 --> 01:14:00,332
Yes, I understand.

643
01:14:01,125 --> 01:14:02,457
Calm down first.

644
01:14:02,958 --> 01:14:04,415
Could you please,

645
01:14:04,541 --> 01:14:06,749
connect me to Malisa?

646
01:14:07,166 --> 01:14:11,832
Sorry but, Ms. Sa can't talk right now,
she's busy.

647
01:14:12,166 --> 01:14:14,790
How can you be sure, that before this,

648
01:14:15,125 --> 01:14:17,707
you weren't using another brand
at the same time?

649
01:14:18,416 --> 01:14:21,499
Som, since I accepted the job,

650
01:14:22,333 --> 01:14:24,957
I haven't been using any other cream.

651
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:28,142
What evidence do you have to accuse us?

652
01:14:28,166 --> 01:14:30,624
Please help me. I'm begging you, Som.

653
01:14:30,875 --> 01:14:33,707
Please. Please, Som.

654
01:14:35,416 --> 01:14:38,059
Don't forget to go buy it.

655
01:14:38,083 --> 01:14:39,809
Malisza brand.

656
01:14:39,833 --> 01:14:43,040
It's so good it fucks up your face!

657
01:14:47,416 --> 01:14:48,915
"Malisa: Ls $3,000 enough?"

658
01:14:48,916 --> 01:14:50,499
"Sun: Can I have another $1,500?"

659
01:14:52,541 --> 01:14:53,999
"Malisa: Promise me this will end"
"Sun: Don't forget our deal!"

660
01:15:07,083 --> 01:15:10,165
Isn't this great? We gotta "share" it.

661
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,040
Where are you hurrying off to, Sa?

662
01:18:01,375 --> 01:18:02,874
Sa, how are you?

663
01:18:08,125 --> 01:18:09,582
Stay strong, Sa.

664
01:18:30,458 --> 01:18:32,374
I know the whole story now.

665
01:18:34,666 --> 01:18:36,457
I know everything now, Sa.

666
01:18:37,458 --> 01:18:39,832
How could you have done something so cruel?

667
01:18:40,041 --> 01:18:42,707
You ruined a person's life!

668
01:18:43,958 --> 01:18:45,957
And you lied to me about it!

669
01:18:48,083 --> 01:18:49,915
Why did you lie to me?

670
01:19:01,333 --> 01:19:03,665
The reason I hate myself right now,

671
01:19:04,583 --> 01:19:07,582
is because I forgive you
even after all this.

672
01:19:08,625 --> 01:19:10,082
I love you, Sa.

673
01:19:12,041 --> 01:19:13,915
I love you too, Jak.

674
01:19:38,875 --> 01:19:39,707
Jak...

675
01:19:43,458 --> 01:19:44,290
Jak...

676
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:54,874
