1
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,250
After the Wuba monster is released by its human parent,

2
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:26,070
Wuba and other monsters move to the jungle.

3
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,000
Together, they build a new Peace Village.

20
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:58,330
So good without human clothes.

21
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,250
Did you lose weight?

22
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,360
That was fun.

23
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:18,570
What is this? / Giant monsters!

24
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,690
Sent by the evil Monsters King!

25
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,410
Protect Wuba! Where is Wuba?

26
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,740
Save the Wuba!

27
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,340
Wuba!

28
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:34,630
There's one more.

29
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,130
Dear.

30
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,650
I will protect you.

31
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,870
There are more.

32
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,910
Four winged monsters!

33
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,610
Honey, swing me up!

34
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,810
Do not think about it!

35
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,290
Xiao Wu.

36
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,490
Catch!

37
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,290
Gao!

38
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,290
Ying!

39
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,510
I understand.

40
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,230
I will not get caught.

41
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,580
Watch out!

42
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,570
Down below!

43
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,470
Sundul!

44
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,160
Gotcha!

45
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,330
Do not let it fly!

46
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,430
Hang on!

47
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,150
We can not take it anymore!

48
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,170
Ying.

49
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,890
- Our turn! - Come on!

50
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,050
Gao, did Wuba get away?

51
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,200
He escaped.

52
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:51,240
I hope he's okay.

53
00:04:54,790 --> 00:05:00,580
The idiots can not even catch a small monster

54
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:07,380
Barr, now I command my fascination with the creature.

55
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:12,170
You have to take him alive.

56
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,190
I want to see what the privilege of this little monster.

57
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:21,760
It may change the human world and the monster.

58
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:26,280
I'll finish this task, Your Honor.

59
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,920
I get the vision again.

60
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:13,210
My master is blind and mute, but he can hear.

61
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:18,210
He said he never felt this strange pulse.

62
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:22,700
It's like all the gynecological disorders of the world enter into one body.

63
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,990
Master wants to know when your menstrual periods will be.

64
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,820
Is it important? / You're a mother.

65
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:33,790
No need to be embarrassed.

66
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,010
He is his mother.

67
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,780
On the 15th of every month ...

68
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,980
... I eat vegetables.

69
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:46,380
Doctor, I'm really healthy. Let's go.

70
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,700
Wait a minute.

71
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,020
Ever since she gave birth, she suffered from depression and insomnia.

72
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,570
Can you fix it, Doc?

73
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:58,070
She said she never treated men for postpartum depression.

74
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,090
Just treat her like a woman.

75
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,210
The way I treat her.

76
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,710
When do you usually feel depressed?

77
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,930
When he thought of when he sent his son away.

78
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,350
The problem is in your mind.

79
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,820
Take this, and cook ....

80
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,920
... with 3 bowls of water ...

81
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,640
May I add the water?

82
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,660
Will make it easier to swallow it.

83
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,810
My lord said you must be delirious!

84
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,830
Master wants you to pour it after being boiled.

85
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:56,850
Then put the incense on it.

86
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,880
Your mind is sick. You have to pray on the sun for positive energy.

87
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Next!

88
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,990
You think Wuba is growing up now?

89
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,380
Watch Out. /Almost.

90
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:32,370
Show me your true form, monster!

91
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:37,470
Where's the little monster?

92
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,790
I do not understand what you mean.

93
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,010
So stiff!

94
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,240
Catch him!

95
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,400
Are you okay? Please hold this.

96
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,890
Thank you for the help.

97
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,710
Are you hurt?

98
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,380
(Bureau of the Monster Hunter)

99
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,000
Are you from the Bureau of the Monster Hunter?

100
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:54,070
Are you also a hunter?

101
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,470
We are just a little hunter. I'm Tianyin Song.

102
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:59,290
This is my wife Xiaolan. And who are you?

103
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:01,710
Yun Qing, from the Bureau of the Monster Hunter.

104
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,460
Sorry, I have to go back.

105
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:06,710
Keep up the good work. Take care of yourself.

106
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:15,650
Do you know,

107
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,450
Yun from the Monster Hunting Bureau.

108
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,270
Because your dad is a hunter of monsters--

109
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:22,690
Maybe we can find the direction of its existence there.

110
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,710
So we have to go. - Come on.

111
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:35,530
Do you think Wubatakut with lightning?

112
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,630
Wuba is trouble-maker

113
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,420
I think lightning is afraid of Wuba.

114
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,720
When did you make this?

115
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,410
Not that I miss Wuba.

116
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:53,610
I just think that monsters and humans can not live side by side.

117
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:59,300
As I talked to this doll,

118
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,500
it made me feel that Wub was around beside me.

119
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,260
I'm a level ten hunter! Give it up, monster!

120
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,640
Monster!

121
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,740
Catch!

122
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,330
That's a real monster!

123
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,420
Catch!

124
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,320
Keep moving! Stop running.

125
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:31,310
City of Clean Water

126
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:51,290
Stop! Do not move!

127
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:08,280
Stop!

128
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:15,370
Hurry up! Search!

129
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,290
Search everywhere!

130
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:23,260
Look under the cart!

131
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,380
Come on, quickly!

132
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,460
Up there! Look up!

133
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:51,230
Forget it.

134
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,350
Let's look elsewhere.

135
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,430
Come on!

136
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,130
Search on!

137
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,310
Where do you come from?

138
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,690
Looking for your parents?

139
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:56,770
Put your bets on!

140
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:59,960
Big! Big!

141
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,160
It's a miracle!

142
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,880
Win 15 times in a row. Really lucky.

143
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,900
Correct. / For someone who has never lost,

144
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,920
it does not matter if you win once again.

145
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,640
Then let me make it meaningful.

146
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,430
One game.

147
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,730
Bets it all. Do you dare to play?

148
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:41,320
If you want to give up, you can take your money now.

149
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,120
I never missed the opportunity.

150
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,440
What else is someone as beautiful as you.

151
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,390
I think our game is over.

152
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:58,750
What is that?

153
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,040
Sorry. Madam, you know where is the bathroom?

154
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,160
It must be on the right.

155
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,390
Wait!

156
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,430
Looks like we got a pair of con artists here.

157
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:14,330
- I have to give you a lesson. - Do not accuse me.

158
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,930
The creature comes out of your side.

159
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:20,250
Looks like you're the one who cheats. I have to teach you a lesson.

160
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:23,160
Tu, you're a traitor.

161
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,190
I have to teach you a lesson.

162
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,320
She Tu?

163
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,210
Where is he?

164
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,300
Tu!

165
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,890
Tu!

166
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:53,090
Tu is there! Catch her!

167
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,170
BenBen! BenBen!

168
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,650
BenBen, why are you flying?

169
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,350
Where is the land?

170
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,200
Back off!

171
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Catch him!

172
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,500
Come forward!

173
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,100
Stop!

174
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,400
Where is he going?

175
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,900
What is this thing?

176
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,900
In my old days, I was with ten people at once.

177
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,620
People call me Killer.

178
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,340
I adore many people,

179
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,900
not because of my remarkable skill,

180
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,220
but because of my integrity.

181
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,740
We've agreed 5 rounds, you play 10 rounds

182
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,200
You blame me now?

183
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:41,520
10 tael for overtime.10 tael for my nausea.

184
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:45,140
You betray me there, so 10 tael for mental suffering.

185
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:47,870
I worked overtime and spent a date with my girl,

186
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:49,290
2 theater tickets wasted--

187
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,920
So it's a total of 10 taels.

188
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:53,240
You mess up the game and now you're asking for money?

189
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:57,160
I look down on people and greedy monsters.

190
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:59,990
Let me tell you, whenever I meet the greedy,

191
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:01,510
I will not forgive.

192
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,240
BenBen! Machete!

193
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,200
What is wrong with you?

194
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,820
Who wants to use this size to kill such a small creature?

195
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,100
Give small ones.

196
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,720
You said you would not give a fucking gay passion.

197
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,500
You can use this to kill yourself.

198
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,100
At least pay my wages.

199
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,000
If not, I'll have my boyfriend eat you alive.

200
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,820
My girlfriend is a great girl.

201
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,140
Are you trying to scare me?

202
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,400
How big is he? Is it as big as my head?

203
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,720
Nice. You want to be a shameless person?

204
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,340
Remember that I have no fear.

205
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:35,370
Calm down.

206
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:39,100
I am a man of dignity with a reputation that must be taken care of.

207
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,000
I'll pay you.

208
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,800
So stiff!

209
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,100
You can pay for this.

210
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,120
And you also have to pay your share.

211
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,200
Go to hell!

212
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,100
Are you happy as rude as this?

213
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,600
You're happy to see me die.

214
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,200
Delicious.

215
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,500
Where did you get this corn?

216
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,920
At the stall Mama Zhang, on the other side of the shop know in the market.

217
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,940
As you pass by tomorrow, bring more.

218
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:20,070
You still owe me 30 Mama Zhang's money.

219
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
He said if you do not pay him,

220
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,300
you must marry his third daughter.

221
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,820
Cui you mean?

222
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,100
His body is twice the size of your body.

223
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,000
Forget it.

224
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:33,320
Tell Mama Zhang, I better pay the debt only.

225
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,100
Who are you?

226
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,000
Are you a secret child?

227
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,000
We just met.

228
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,300
Stop babbling!

229
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
You eat my corn and you behave to me?

230
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,200
Goodbye, little boy!

231
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,500
Bureau of the Monster Hunter

232
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,300
Payday.

233
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,000
Spiky!

234
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,100
The monster is still a child.

235
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,120
Correct.

236
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,800
thanks.

237
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,220
Next, Hunter Zhang.

238
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,200
The rich Monster Hunter Bureau.

239
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,820
thanks.

240
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:26,000
Actually, now I should be a 3rd rank hunter.

241
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,100
The salary would be pretty good.

242
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,120
I also should be upgraded.

243
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,900
You?

244
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,800
You should have your baby.

245
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,800
Weapon Workshop

246
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,900
Purchases on the left, fixes on the right.

247
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,420
Do not ask questions.

248
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,940
I am busy.

249
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:10,270
Excuse me. /A woman?

250
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:12,190
We're just looking around.

251
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,420
Wait.

252
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,000
I--

253
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,420
Workshop owner?

254
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,040
How do you know?

255
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,470
You fix the weapon?

256
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,600
Your weapons need to be fixed?

257
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,800
How do you know?

258
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Is it broken when hunting monsters?

259
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,620
How do you know?

260
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,400
Guess how I can tell?

261
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,520
I--

262
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,940
I do not think you need to know.

263
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:44,170
Should I talk to the others, or can you fix it?

264
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,900
This damaged whip is a proof of ignorance and superficiality.

265
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,120
Why can not you take care of him?

266
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,500
It really can not be fixed.

267
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,300
Never mind him.

268
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,300
I think you're special.

269
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,620
Really?

270
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,040
You look like you're not in the heat in two months.

271
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:05,170
It shows you do not care about small business.

272
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,190
You only care about big business.

273
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,400
Give it to me!

274
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,120
I am the one who has ruined his whip.

275
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,340
This is mine.

276
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,200
Madam,

277
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,100
I feel we understand each other.

278
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,100
Since it's yours,

279
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,000
it inspires me. I suddenly thought of fixing it.

280
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,020
I know you can do it.

281
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I feel that the connection is shared.

282
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,800
OK.

283
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:34,120
The warriors want a new weapon as well.

284
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,340
Whatever the lady wants, will be fulfilled.

285
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:41,000
After all, the family spirit is hard to come by.

286
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,800
thanks.

287
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,620
Your place is full of valuable goods.

288
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,140
Take whatever you want.

289
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,700
See you later.

290
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,320
Please fix my whips soon.

291
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Hey, you're not happy just now?

292
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,200
How do you know?

293
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,000
Because we share the connection.

294
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,500
Why do not you connect with him?

295
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,020
You are jealous.

296
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,040
Zhu Gold Bank

297
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,300
Bos Zhu.

298
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,200
How are you?

299
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,820
When you owe me money, you call me Zhu Boss.

300
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,040
When you want to borrow money, you call me Little Zhu.

301
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:46,070
Which one is in your heart?

302
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,620
I have another question, and you should answer honestly.

303
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,240
When will I pay it, right?

304
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,370
Wrong.

305
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,000
When are we getting married?

306
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
If the debt is not paid within 3 months,

307
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,620
Little Tutu will marry his beloved Little One.

308
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,140
You signed this marriage agreement,

309
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,100
and you even put your lips.

310
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,300
You made me drunk and forced me to sign it.

311
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,120
I think it's a Debt Agreement.

312
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:20,040
I do not care about the money.

313
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:21,670
I checked my calendar ...

314
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:26,590
... and today is the perfect day for marriage.

315
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,620
Not today.

316
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,140
We must do this with our parents and matchmakers

317
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,160
This is not true.

318
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:34,390
You just do not marry me, do you?

319
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:38,000
You're a real jerk.

320
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,300
Choose your favorite girl.

321
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,100
I can choose whoever I like?

322
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,000
You can choose me too (Marry me).

323
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,100
Hairdresser

324
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,100
Please comb my hair slowly. No need to be too beautiful.

325
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,600
Talk! When will you pay your debt?

326
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,020
I really want to pay for it.

327
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,040
but I do not have the money.

328
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:52,070
Why do not you pick another girl.

329
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:54,090
Tooth extraction

330
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,200
Spanking

331
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,320
Massage

332
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,900
What if ... him.

333
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,900
Stop the massage!

334
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,220
3 days.

335
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,040
I will pay off in 3 days.

336
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,600
If you can not pay yet, I'll let you ...

337
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,400
... cut up my body and paraded me into the street.

338
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:37,900
Boss. Those who say find a small monster have arrived.

339
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,220
Bos Zhu.

340
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,300
(A great gift for anyone who finds this monster)

341
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,100
Next!

342
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,200
Next!

343
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,100
Go away!

344
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Boss. Tu can die for too much laughter.

345
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,300
Stop it!

346
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,900
If he died, who would marry me?

347
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,300
Who will marry me?

348
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,220
This is what I want.

349
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,000
Not this.

350
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,700
You also looking for that little friend?

351
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,600
That's what babbling, "wuba wuba"?

352
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,120
You know where that is?

353
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:37,040
We are close friends. We often play together.

354
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,500
Bring me.

355
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:43,150
Then we can re-negotiate our agreement.
