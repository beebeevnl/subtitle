surpassed only by that
of the king,

212

330

Well, that was quite easy.

331
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,947
Yes, it was.

(clears throat)

333
00:18:23,051 --> 00:18:27,052
I believe we are
to meet regularly.

How is...

How are you for Mondays?

337
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:37,061
Um, I shall endeavor
to be available

338

- on Mondays.
- 4:00?

I nap at 4:00.

Is that permissible?

341
00:18:44,972 --> 00:18:46,938
No. But necessary.

342
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,072
I work late.

343
00:18:48,074 --> 00:18:50,475
Oh. Then perhaps lunchtime.

344
00:18:50,477 --> 00:18:52,477
Lunch?

Mondays?

Thank you, sir.

what's your agenda?

Uh, a glass of Pol Roger.

for supporting

his brother's marriage
to Wallis Simpson.

You only have to meet him
once a week.

366

Oh, but that's like saying
you only have to have

Oh, more than that.

Yes, I-I'll be there
in a jiffy, my love.

380
00:20:35,076 --> 00:20:37,076
I heard that before
you were asked,

381
00:20:37,078 --> 00:20:39,078
they offered it
to Lord Halifax.

382
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,514
Oh, I doubt that.

383
00:20:40,516 --> 00:20:43,350
Halifax would never
turn it down.

He's the fourth son of an earl.

385

Fourth sons turn nothing down.

I wish the position had come
your way in better times, sir.

What a... a frightful sight.

- Yes, a speech.

Um... some of you may not know
that on the eve

401
00:21:23,957 --> 00:21:26,157
of our marriage
I got cold feet.

402
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,392
But as I'd already called off
two engagements

403
00:21:28,394 --> 00:21:30,594
by the age of 21
and was in danger of gaining

404
00:21:30,596 --> 00:21:32,229
a reputation
for being a bolter...

405
00:21:32,231 --> 00:21:33,631
- (laughter)
- ...it would have been poor form

406
00:21:33,633 --> 00:21:35,667
- to call off a third.
- Hear, hear.

407
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,134
MARY:
Lucky for Daddy.

408
00:21:37,136 --> 00:21:39,137
But the real reason
for my wintery feet

409
00:21:39,139 --> 00:21:42,207
was that I knew, even then,

410
00:21:42,209 --> 00:21:45,643
that his priority
would be public life.

411
00:21:45,645 --> 00:21:47,645
But it worried
a young girl greatly,

412
00:21:47,647 --> 00:21:51,014
this wretched thought
of eternally coming second.

413
00:21:51,016 --> 00:21:52,983
But so it has proven to be.

414
00:21:52,985 --> 00:21:56,286
And in due course, our children
would have to make their peace

415
00:21:56,288 --> 00:21:58,257
with this same fact.

416
00:21:59,659 --> 00:22:01,494
We all did, you see.

417
00:22:02,561 --> 00:22:04,364
In our own way.

418
00:22:06,532 --> 00:22:12,201
And now, today,
we are to receive our reward.

419
00:22:12,203 --> 00:22:15,237
Proof that our small sacrifice

420
00:22:15,239 --> 00:22:17,575
was for a far,
far greater good.

421

429

(murmuring)

445
00:24:06,247 --> 00:24:09,248
It was the evident wish
and will

446
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:12,115
of Parliament and the nation

447
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:17,488
that this should be conceived
on the broadest possible basis.

448
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:20,391
And that it should include
all parties.

00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:50,786
LAYTON: "The three

Uh, uh, miss?

00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:20,783
Uh, I'm coming out
in a state of nature.

(gasps)

472
00:25:27,591 --> 00:25:29,556
It must be remembered

473
00:25:29,558 --> 00:25:32,560
that we are in
the preliminary stage

474
00:25:32,562 --> 00:25:36,697
of one of the greatest battles
in history.

475
00:25:36,699 --> 00:25:38,565
And that many preparations

476
00:25:38,567 --> 00:25:41,136

with a buoyancy and hope,

480
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:51,879
and say to the House,
as I have said

481
00:25:51,881 --> 00:25:53,880
to those who have joined
the government,

482
00:25:53,882 --> 00:25:57,583
I have nothing to offer

483
00:25:57,585 --> 00:26:01,723
but blood, toil, tears
and sweat.

484
00:26:04,627 --> 00:26:09,530
We have before us an ordeal
of the most grievous kind.

485
00:26:09,532 --> 00:26:13,166
We have before us
many, many long months

486

of struggle and of suffering.

487
00:26:16,403 --> 00:26:20,438
You ask, "What is our policy?"

488
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,509
I say it is to wage war

489
00:26:23,511 --> 00:26:26,811
by sea, land and air

490
00:26:26,813 --> 00:26:28,880
with all our might

491
00:26:28,882 --> 00:26:34,220

493
00:26:40,194 --> 00:26:43,828
never surpassed in the dark
and lamentable catalogue

494
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,429

495

"What is our aim?"

497

I can answer in one word.

498

Victory.

499
00:26:58,578 --> 00:27:01,545
Victory at all costs.

500
00:27:01,547 --> 00:27:05,215
Victory,
in spite of all terror.

501
00:27:05,217 --> 00:27:10,453
Victory, however long
and-and hard the road may be.

502
00:27:10,455 --> 00:27:13,523
For without victory,

503
00:27:13,525 --> 00:27:16,762
there can be no survival.

let alone entering

516
00:28:11,513 --> 00:28:14,382
Awful, the thought
that I shall never see

from office.

521
00:28:35,636 --> 00:28:37,871
If we can get him to declare
that he refuses

522
00:28:37,873 --> 00:28:40,439
to even consider peace
negotiations with Germany,

523
00:28:40,441 --> 00:28:43,610
you and I would perhaps
have clear grounds to resign.

524
00:28:43,612 --> 00:28:46,912
That would force a vote
of no confidence.

525
00:28:46,914 --> 00:28:48,847
The party
couldn't countenance that.

526
00:28:48,849 --> 00:28:51,484
You're the chairman,
for heaven's sake.

527
00:28:51,486 --> 00:28:52,785
He'd be finished.

528
00:28:52,787 --> 00:28:56,389
And you would agree
to be prime minister.

529
00:28:56,391 --> 00:28:58,791

But the important thing,

is that your policies
would be back on the table.

533

Peace and the protection
of our nation.

534

On record.

535

I beg your pardon.

536
00:29:12,672 --> 00:29:13,839
He must declare, on record,

537
00:29:13,841 --> 00:29:17,775
his refusal to engage
in peace talks.

538

(chuckles)

656
00:36:34,229 --> 00:36:37,496
Brandy and port
until the wee hours.

657
00:36:37,498 --> 00:36:40,433
- I wouldn't let him borrow my bicycle.
- (chuckles)

658
00:36:40,435 --> 00:36:43,236
He's a Conservative
who defects to the Liberals,

659
00:36:43,238 --> 00:36:45,837
lobs grenades at us
for ten years,

660
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:49,975
then flops Conservative again
as it bloody suits him.

661
00:36:49,977 --> 00:36:52,844
Sorry, but he stands
for one thing.

662
00:36:52,846 --> 00:36:54,013
Himself.

663
00:36:54,015 --> 00:36:58,349
We may have to replace him,
Bertie.

664
00:36:58,351 --> 00:37:00,452
Replace him?

665
00:37:00,454 --> 00:37:02,854
We must strive for peace

666
00:37:02,856 --> 00:37:05,122
so that every son and daughter
of this land

667
00:37:05,124 --> 00:37:06,925
can emerge from this crisis

668
00:37:06,927 --> 00:37:09,430
with something recognizable
as home.

669
00:37:10,898 --> 00:37:14,102
Spoken like a true
prime minister.

670
00:37:22,875 --> 00:37:24,277
(grunts)

671
00:37:28,181 --> 00:37:31,083
"V for Victory."

672
00:37:32,284 --> 00:37:35,020
You need to reply
to the Lord Privy Seal.

673
00:37:36,188 --> 00:37:40,056
Uh... uh, uh,
tell the Lord Privy Seal

674
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:42,058
I am sealed in the privy.

675
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:45,562
And I can only deal
with one shit at a time.

676
00:37:45,564 --> 00:37:48,033
- (laughter)
- (toilet flushing)

677
00:37:50,168 --> 00:37:53,435
- (grunts, sighs)
- (typing)

678
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:58,041
The broadcast is tonight,
so don't spare me, Anthony.

679
00:37:58,043 --> 00:38:00,178
- Be frank.
- Mm.

680
00:38:02,012 --> 00:38:04,115
(typing continues)

681
00:38:07,586 --> 00:38:09,218
I don't think so.

682
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,520
(chuckling): You, uh...
you don't think so what?

683
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:14,456
You're suggesting
we're somehow winning.

684
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:15,590
We're not.

685
00:38:15,592 --> 00:38:20,462
No, but, uh,
it will inspire them.

686
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,530
- Winston, I know...
- Anthony, Anthony.

687
00:38:22,532 --> 00:38:26,034
I am going to imbue them
with a...

688
00:38:26,036 --> 00:38:30,338
a-a spirit of feeling
they don't yet know they have.

689
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,608
You asked my opinion.

690
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:35,078
I caution against it.

691
00:38:36,946 --> 00:38:39,249
Cicero.

692
00:38:40,984 --> 00:38:43,153
Cicero!

693
00:38:44,653 --> 00:38:49,323
"If fortune is adverse..."
Uh... uh, something,

694
00:38:49,325 --> 00:38:51,959
uh, something, something.

695
00:38:51,961 --> 00:38:54,595
(grunting, panting)

696
00:38:54,597 --> 00:38:57,496
(muttering)

697
00:38:57,498 --> 00:38:59,231
Well...

698
00:38:59,233 --> 00:39:02,501
Well, it's not there.
I left it there.

699
00:39:02,503 --> 00:39:04,637
Clemmie!

700
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:06,072
Cat!

701
00:39:06,074 --> 00:39:07,239
Clemmie!

702
00:39:07,241 --> 00:39:08,407
We cannot pay our bills.

703
00:39:08,409 --> 00:39:10,677
My-my-my copy of, uh, Cicero.

704
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:13,079
- Did-did you shelve it?
- Did you hear what I said?

705
00:39:13,081 --> 00:39:14,514
- What was that?
- We're broke.

706
00:39:14,516 --> 00:39:16,516
Oh. Um...

707
00:39:16,518 --> 00:39:18,217
Out! Uh, out.

708
00:39:18,219 --> 00:39:20,155
Come on. Everybody out.

709
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:22,687
I dare not write another check.

710
00:39:22,689 --> 00:39:25,491
(sighs, grunts)
Well, I'll economize.

711
00:39:25,493 --> 00:39:27,993
Only, uh, four cigars a day.

712
00:39:27,995 --> 00:39:30,565
You are insufferable!

713
00:39:34,401 --> 00:39:36,134
Is there anything else?

714
00:39:36,136 --> 00:39:37,535
Yes.

715
00:39:37,537 --> 00:39:38,671
My love for you.

716
00:39:38,673 --> 00:39:41,609
(sighs) How much have you had
to drink this morning?

717
00:39:43,678 --> 00:39:46,077
I see you now

718
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:49,046
as I first saw you

719
00:39:49,048 --> 00:39:51,349
in-in 1904.

720
00:39:51,351 --> 00:39:53,684
And-and I simply stood,
speechless.

721
00:39:53,686 --> 00:39:55,385
Well, I must have been
very beautiful

722
00:39:55,387 --> 00:39:56,688
to achieve
that miraculous effect.

723
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:59,523
Four years until we saw
each other again.

724
00:39:59,525 --> 00:40:01,059
Went by in an absolute flash.

725
00:40:01,061 --> 00:40:02,693
You didn't lack for admirers.

726
00:40:02,695 --> 00:40:07,197
Your <i>fidele serviteur</i>
in Sidney Peel.

727
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:09,133
- Brilliant man.
- Lionel Earle.

728
00:40:09,135 --> 00:40:11,000
(chuckles)
Wonderful dancer.

729
00:40:11,002 --> 00:40:15,038
And then at Lady St. Helier's
dinner party.

730
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,574
Who should show up?

731
00:40:17,576 --> 00:40:19,343
Pig.

732
00:40:19,345 --> 00:40:21,578
- (imitates a pig's snort)
- (both chuckle)

733
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,679
Just the same.

734
00:40:23,681 --> 00:40:25,984
(sighs)

735
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:35,626
Are we terribly old?

736
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,126
Yes, I'm afraid you are.

737
00:40:38,128 --> 00:40:40,262
- Oh, you beast.
- (laughing)

738
00:40:40,264 --> 00:40:42,434
Oh, you... (laughs)

739
00:40:45,003 --> 00:40:48,003
Would you... would you
hear me read my speech

740
00:40:48,005 --> 00:40:49,472
for tonight's broadcast?

741
00:40:49,474 --> 00:40:51,374
- (door opens)
- Prime Minister.

742
00:40:51,376 --> 00:40:53,342
Prime Minister,
the situation in France.

743
00:40:53,344 --> 00:40:55,711
Uh, is it true
we're in full retreat?

744
00:40:55,713 --> 00:40:57,715
Is France lost?

745
00:41:04,453 --> 00:41:07,121
"The Spanish ships
I cannot see,

746
00:41:07,123 --> 00:41:09,123
for they are out of sight."

747
00:41:09,125 --> 00:41:12,127
If you will sit here...

748
00:41:12,129 --> 00:41:14,397
at your desk.

749
00:41:16,065 --> 00:41:18,468
And speak slowly and clearly.

750
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:20,768
Into the microphone.

751
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:22,769
- (sighs)
- So...

752
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:26,372
if you're ready,
on the stroke of 9:00,

753
00:41:26,374 --> 00:41:27,774
the red light will come on,

754
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:30,447
and we shall go live
to the nation.

755
00:41:32,148 --> 00:41:35,749
9:00, red light...

756
00:41:35,751 --> 00:41:37,785
you begin.

757
00:41:37,787 --> 00:41:39,318
Yes?

758
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,990
Uh, one moment.

759
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:45,124
(pen continues scratching
on paper)

760
00:41:45,126 --> 00:41:47,261
(Winston muttering quietly)

761
00:41:48,429 --> 00:41:51,496
Prime Minister, are we ready?

762
00:41:51,498 --> 00:41:55,270
Uh... uh, one moment,
one moment.

763
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:58,039
(clock ticking)

764
00:42:00,408 --> 00:42:02,141
We are going live...

765
00:42:02,143 --> 00:42:04,076
One moment, damn you!

766
00:42:04,078 --> 00:42:06,347
(clock ticking)

767
00:42:10,416 --> 00:42:14,852
- (pen continues writing)
- And four, three,

768
00:42:14,854 --> 00:42:16,854
two, one.

769
00:42:16,856 --> 00:42:18,692
(writing stops)

770
00:42:37,275 --> 00:42:40,510
I speak to you
for the first time

771
00:42:40,512 --> 00:42:42,713
- as prime minister
- (Layton whispering along)

772
00:42:42,715 --> 00:42:47,884
in a solemn hour
for the life of our country,

773
00:42:47,886 --> 00:42:52,255
of our empire, of our allies

774
00:42:52,257 --> 00:42:56,793
and, above all,
of the cause of freedom.

775
00:42:56,795 --> 00:42:59,361
- A tremendous battle
- (continues whispering along)

776
00:42:59,363 --> 00:43:02,464
- is raging in France and Flanders.
- MAN: Shh.

777
00:43:02,466 --> 00:43:04,667
(Layton stops whispering along)

778
00:43:04,669 --> 00:43:08,738
The Germans,
by a remarkable combination

779
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:12,875
of air bombing
and heavily armored tanks,

780
00:43:12,877 --> 00:43:16,145
have broken through
the French defenses

781
00:43:16,147 --> 00:43:19,649
- north of the Maginot Line...
- (radio warbling)

782
00:43:19,651 --> 00:43:21,216
(over speaker):
...and strong columns

783
00:43:21,218 --> 00:43:22,650
of their armored vehicles

784
00:43:22,652 --> 00:43:24,586
are ravaging
the open country...

785
00:43:24,588 --> 00:43:26,220
(indistinct whispering)

786
00:43:26,222 --> 00:43:29,157
(over radio): ...which,
for the first day or two,

787
00:43:29,159 --> 00:43:31,460
was without defenders.

788
00:43:31,462 --> 00:43:37,499
However,
I have invincible confidence

789
00:43:37,501 --> 00:43:40,635
in the French Army
and its leaders.

790
00:43:40,637 --> 00:43:44,572
(echoing): Only a very small
part of that splendid army

791
00:43:44,574 --> 00:43:47,207
has yet been heavily engaged,

792
00:43:47,209 --> 00:43:52,879
and only a very small part
of France has yet been invaded.

793
00:43:52,881 --> 00:43:54,681
Side by side,

794
00:43:54,683 --> 00:43:58,919
the British and French peoples
have advanced.

795
00:43:58,921 --> 00:44:01,922
- "Advanced"?
- To rescue not only Europe.

796
00:44:01,924 --> 00:44:05,526
- How bloody dare he.
- But mankind

797
00:44:05,528 --> 00:44:10,229
from the foulest and most
soul-destroying tyranny

798
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:12,264
<i>which has ever darkened</i>

799
00:44:12,266 --> 00:44:15,735
<i>and stained the pages
of history.</i>

800
00:44:15,737 --> 00:44:19,905
<i>But now one bond
unites us all.</i>

801
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:24,878
<i>To wage war until victory
is won,</i>

802
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,314
<i>and never to surrender
ourselves</i>

803
00:44:28,316 --> 00:44:31,550
<i>to servitude and shame.</i>

804
00:44:31,552 --> 00:44:34,553
<i>Whatever the cost</i>

805
00:44:34,555 --> 00:44:37,522
<i>and the agony may be,</i>

806
00:44:37,524 --> 00:44:40,426
conquer we must,

807
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:43,698
as conquer we shall.

808
00:44:49,703 --> 00:44:51,705
LAYTON:
Well done, sir.

809
00:45:00,579 --> 00:45:03,183
(echoing clinking)

810
00:45:04,985 --> 00:45:06,954
(door clunks open)

811
00:45:15,362 --> 00:45:17,829
(radio warbling)

812
00:45:17,831 --> 00:45:19,466
(warbling stops)

813
00:45:27,438 --> 00:45:31,243
(clanking and creaking)

814
00:45:38,783 --> 00:45:40,486
(clunk)

815
00:45:57,934 --> 00:46:01,403
Oh, I thought you did
marvelously.

816
00:46:01,405 --> 00:46:02,805
The last ten years,

817
00:46:02,807 --> 00:46:05,441
I was the only one
who told them the truth.

818
00:46:05,443 --> 00:46:07,475
- (glass clinking)
- Until tonight.

819
00:46:07,477 --> 00:46:09,076
(drink pouring)

820
00:46:09,078 --> 00:46:11,281
There is no advance.

821
00:46:12,982 --> 00:46:15,583
It's a shambles.

822
00:46:15,585 --> 00:46:18,585
We're in full retreat.

823
00:46:18,587 --> 00:46:19,920
(grunts)

824
00:46:19,922 --> 00:46:21,588
But would you be
serving them tonight

825
00:46:21,590 --> 00:46:23,692
by denying them
their sleep and...

826
00:46:23,694 --> 00:46:25,025
and terrifying their children?

827
00:46:25,027 --> 00:46:27,628
(stammers) What, even if
the terror is coming?

828
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:29,899
Because the terror is coming.

829
00:46:31,601 --> 00:46:34,067
There's time enough
for the truth.

830
00:46:34,069 --> 00:46:35,939
WINSTON:
Mm.

831
00:46:42,944 --> 00:46:45,479
(laughing):
Have you seen this?

832
00:46:45,481 --> 00:46:47,617
(laughing, snorting)

833
00:46:49,352 --> 00:46:51,651
- What's so funny?
- Oh.

834
00:46:51,653 --> 00:46:54,087
Prime Minister. Sir.

835
00:46:54,089 --> 00:46:55,923
Yes, what is it?

836
00:46:55,925 --> 00:46:58,326
Um... perhaps...

837
00:47:00,561 --> 00:47:03,095
Um... look, I'm...

838
00:47:03,097 --> 00:47:06,099
I'm not sure
if you know this, but, um...

839
00:47:06,101 --> 00:47:09,135
uh, but the way you're doing
your "V for Victory" sign...

840
00:47:09,137 --> 00:47:10,702
Hmm?

841
00:47:10,704 --> 00:47:12,771
Well, in the poorer quarters,

842
00:47:12,773 --> 00:47:14,706
that gesture means
something else.

843
00:47:14,708 --> 00:47:15,941
What does it mean?

844
00:47:15,943 --> 00:47:17,710
Well, I wouldn't like
to say, sir.

845
00:47:17,712 --> 00:47:19,845
I was captured by the Boer.

846
00:47:19,847 --> 00:47:23,080
I spent time
in a South African prison.

847
00:47:23,082 --> 00:47:24,718
Up your bum.

848
00:47:25,651 --> 00:47:27,118
Sir.

849
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,953
Up your bum?

850
00:47:28,955 --> 00:47:31,390
(laughing):
Bum. Up your...

851
00:47:31,392 --> 00:47:33,924
(both laughing)

852
00:47:33,926 --> 00:47:36,127
The way you're doing it, sir,
yes, sir.

853
00:47:36,129 --> 00:47:39,997
(laughing): But if you
turn it around, that's fine.

854
00:47:39,999 --> 00:47:41,565
(both laughing)

855
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:43,468
I wouldn't like
millions of people

856
00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:44,835
to take it the wrong way.

857
00:47:44,837 --> 00:47:46,737
(laughing):
Indeed.

858
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:48,407
- Sir.
- Sir.

859
00:47:49,508 --> 00:47:52,575
(laughing):
And up your bum!

860
00:47:52,577 --> 00:47:54,043
Your Majesty.

861
00:47:54,045 --> 00:47:56,746
GEORGE VI: Don't want to take
too much of your time.

862
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:59,483
I heard you on the wireless.

863
00:47:59,485 --> 00:48:01,885
Huh. Was I comprehensible?

864
00:48:01,887 --> 00:48:06,756
The public need to be led,
not misled.

865
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:10,363
Not left to work it out
for themselves.

866
00:48:12,631 --> 00:48:14,797
Right.

867
00:48:14,799 --> 00:48:17,433
Will that be all, Your Majesty?

868
00:48:17,435 --> 00:48:18,500
Yes.

869
00:48:18,502 --> 00:48:19,969
Good day, Prime Minister.

870
00:48:19,971 --> 00:48:21,407
Good day.

871
00:48:24,509 --> 00:48:29,048
I believe I have just received
a royal rap on the knuckles.

872
00:48:29,848 --> 00:48:31,384
Hmm. (sniffs)

873
00:48:35,218 --> 00:48:36,985
As of 2000 hours last night,

874
00:48:36,987 --> 00:48:40,655
the Germans have encircled
60 British,

875
00:48:40,657 --> 00:48:42,590
Belgian and French divisions.

876
00:48:42,592 --> 00:48:47,195
On our part, all our forces
under Lord Gort have withdrawn

877
00:48:47,197 --> 00:48:50,932
or are trying to withdraw to
the French coast, to Dunkirk,

878
00:48:50,934 --> 00:48:52,668
where we cannot reach them.

879
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:54,669
How many of our men
are trapped?

880
00:48:54,671 --> 00:48:56,003
All of them.

881
00:48:56,005 --> 00:48:58,940
Our country's entire
professional soldiery.

882
00:48:58,942 --> 00:49:01,844
And we can see no clear way
to rescue them.

883
00:49:04,746 --> 00:49:07,514
General, are-are you telling me

884
00:49:07,516 --> 00:49:11,819
that we shall have lost
the entire British Army

885
00:49:11,821 --> 00:49:13,788
by the next few days?

886
00:49:13,790 --> 00:49:15,822
That's correct.

887
00:49:15,824 --> 00:49:19,594
POUND: The German force
is superior in every regard

888
00:49:19,596 --> 00:49:21,260
and only 50 miles
from the coast.

889
00:49:21,262 --> 00:49:23,229
They are pushing us
into the sea.

890
00:49:23,231 --> 00:49:27,533
No, the Germans
must not reach the sea.

891
00:49:27,535 --> 00:49:31,705
Not... not before
we evacuate our-our men.

892
00:49:31,707 --> 00:49:33,073
Ismay, what have you got
for us?

893
00:49:33,075 --> 00:49:34,807
ISMAY:
As it stands, I cannot see

894
00:49:34,809 --> 00:49:40,213
we have much hope of getting
any of our forces out in time.

895
00:49:40,215 --> 00:49:42,084
Not a man?

896
00:49:43,251 --> 00:49:46,117
Well, we...
well, we cannot be so,

897
00:49:46,119 --> 00:49:47,619
uh, totally at their mercy.

898
00:49:47,621 --> 00:49:49,223
Wh-What's our next step?

899
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:52,224
Anyone?

900
00:49:52,226 --> 00:49:53,994
Come on, speak!

901
00:49:56,029 --> 00:49:58,530
We still have a garrison
at Calais.

902
00:49:58,532 --> 00:49:59,732
25 miles to the west.

903
00:49:59,734 --> 00:50:01,534
Well, how many men
do we have there?

904
00:50:01,536 --> 00:50:03,735
4,000, more or less.

905
00:50:03,737 --> 00:50:05,003
(grunts)

906
00:50:05,005 --> 00:50:08,574
Then why...
why didn't you say so?

907
00:50:08,576 --> 00:50:11,943
Yes. Then we, uh...
we have them go east,

908
00:50:11,945 --> 00:50:14,778
engage with the German columns
moving on Dunkirk,

909
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:15,946
buy us some time.

910
00:50:15,948 --> 00:50:18,249
Dr-Draw the... the Nazi focus

911
00:50:18,251 --> 00:50:21,319
away from Dunkirk
whilst we execute a...

912
00:50:21,321 --> 00:50:23,821
a-a maritime evacuation
of our forces.

913
00:50:23,823 --> 00:50:25,323
Is that, uh, possible?

914
00:50:25,325 --> 00:50:27,158
It would mean a huge sacrifice.

915
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,760
4,000 young men.

916
00:50:28,762 --> 00:50:32,029
To save 300,000.

917
00:50:32,031 --> 00:50:34,565
Under whose command
is the, uh, Calais garrison?

918
00:50:34,567 --> 00:50:35,766
Uh, Brigadier Nicholson.

919
00:50:35,768 --> 00:50:37,733
Very well.

920
00:50:37,735 --> 00:50:39,068
Huh.

921
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:41,038
Tell Nicholson it is
of the greatest importance

922
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,905
to this island that...

923
00:50:42,907 --> 00:50:45,641
that his garrison
draw the enemy's tanks

924
00:50:45,643 --> 00:50:47,844
and artillery and bombers
away from Dunkirk.

925
00:50:47,846 --> 00:50:50,183
Invite their wrath, and...

926
00:50:51,784 --> 00:50:54,717
...well, and to fight on

927
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:56,821
if needs be...

928
00:51:00,191 --> 00:51:05,129
...i-if needs be, until the
destruction of his command.

929
00:51:06,598 --> 00:51:09,067
It's suicide.

930
00:51:20,144 --> 00:51:24,012
Prime Minister,
I have reservations.

931
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:27,615
Well, who is free
of reservations?

932
00:51:27,617 --> 00:51:29,316
About unnecessary sacrifice,

933
00:51:29,318 --> 00:51:32,088
when there is
an available alternative.

934
00:51:33,056 --> 00:51:34,322
What alternative?

935
00:51:34,324 --> 00:51:37,224
Italy has offered
to mediate peace talks

936
00:51:37,226 --> 00:51:39,360
between ourselves and Germany.

937
00:51:39,362 --> 00:51:40,795
I already indicated that,

938
00:51:40,797 --> 00:51:42,030
provided the liberty
and independence

939
00:51:42,032 --> 00:51:43,831
of the British Empire
was assured,

940
00:51:43,833 --> 00:51:46,132
we would consider any proposal.

941
00:51:46,134 --> 00:51:50,803
With, uh... with Hitler
holding the... the whip hand.

942
00:51:50,805 --> 00:51:52,239
Do you really think
he would honor

943
00:51:52,241 --> 00:51:54,074
our liberty and independence?

944
00:51:54,076 --> 00:51:56,176
It would be in his interest
to do so, sir.

945
00:51:56,178 --> 00:51:59,013
- Because the British Empire...
- The only thing to do

946
00:51:59,015 --> 00:52:01,015
is to show that maniac

947
00:52:01,017 --> 00:52:03,650
that he cannot conquer
this island,

948
00:52:03,652 --> 00:52:05,752
and for that we need an army.

949
00:52:05,754 --> 00:52:07,120
General,
tell Brigadier Nicholson

950
00:52:07,122 --> 00:52:08,854
the Germans must not
reach the sea.

951
00:52:08,856 --> 00:52:10,889
Not before
we-we-we get our boys

952
00:52:10,891 --> 00:52:13,660
off of that bloody beach!

953
00:52:13,662 --> 00:52:15,128
I take full responsibility.

954
00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:16,796
Really?

955
00:52:16,798 --> 00:52:18,264
Really! Yes, sir.

956
00:52:18,266 --> 00:52:20,867
- It is the reason...
- (chair bangs on floor)

957
00:52:20,869 --> 00:52:23,671
I sit in this chair!

958
00:52:25,874 --> 00:52:27,340
Well, surely, before you take

959
00:52:27,342 --> 00:52:30,209
full responsibility
for the deaths of 4,000 men,

960
00:52:30,211 --> 00:52:33,281
you'd wish to consider
every available avenue.

961
00:52:35,915 --> 00:52:38,884
What... what is this?

962
00:52:38,886 --> 00:52:40,918
What is your mind
on the principle

963
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,924
of peace talks, sir?

964
00:52:46,359 --> 00:52:49,694
Do we take it, for example,
that you preclude yourself

965
00:52:49,696 --> 00:52:53,400
from even considering taking
part in such negotiations?

966
00:53:13,186 --> 00:53:17,053
I should like to speak
to Viscount Halifax

967
00:53:17,055 --> 00:53:19,457
and, uh, Mr. Chamberlain.

968
00:53:19,459 --> 00:53:20,889
Alone.

969
00:53:20,891 --> 00:53:25,061
Issue the order
to the Calais garrison.

970
00:53:25,063 --> 00:53:27,764
Confirm it has been done.

971
00:53:27,766 --> 00:53:29,068
Dismissed.

972
00:53:30,868 --> 00:53:32,435
Now, you two... come on.

973
00:53:32,437 --> 00:53:34,105
Out.

You... come on, hop it!

976
00:53:38,509 --> 00:53:40,076
Out. Out!

00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:26,723
(match strikes)

983
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:51,143
Winston...

984
00:54:51,145 --> 00:54:54,314
we are facing
certain defeat on land,

985
00:54:54,316 --> 00:54:59,552
the annihilation of our army,
and imminent invasion.

986
00:54:59,554 --> 00:55:01,287
We must be rational.

987
00:55:01,289 --> 00:55:04,222
We are a seagoing nation.

988
00:55:04,224 --> 00:55:07,960
Have been since the Bronze Age.

989
00:55:07,962 --> 00:55:10,162
The Channel is ours.

990
00:55:10,164 --> 00:55:12,398
It's our moat, our battlement,

991
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:15,934
and the German doesn't
recognize an expanse of water

992
00:55:15,936 --> 00:55:17,603
greater than a bloody lake.

993
00:55:17,605 --> 00:55:21,205
They have first to reach
this island, Edward.

994
00:55:21,207 --> 00:55:23,040
Where men, women and children,

995
00:55:23,042 --> 00:55:24,908
whom we will have failed
despicably

996
00:55:24,910 --> 00:55:27,312
in our duty of protection,
will be entirely defenseless...

997
00:55:27,314 --> 00:55:29,346
And whose fault is that?

998
00:55:29,348 --> 00:55:32,382
...against the largest army
the world has ever seen.

999
00:55:32,384 --> 00:55:34,185
Furthermore, once France falls,

1000
00:55:34,187 --> 00:55:36,955
Germany can concentrate
on aircraft production.

1001
00:55:36,957 --> 00:55:39,424
They will then have
the French fleet as well.

1002
00:55:39,426 --> 00:55:42,125
What is to stop Herr Hitler
then, Winston?

1003
00:55:42,127 --> 00:55:45,798
Words, words, words alone.

1004
00:55:47,333 --> 00:55:49,265
If you will not permit
any talk of peace,

1005
00:55:49,267 --> 00:55:50,499
then I shall be forced...

1006
00:55:50,501 --> 00:55:52,602
CHAMBERLAIN:
Might we not allow Edward

1007
00:55:52,604 --> 00:55:56,874
simply to meet the
Italian Ambassador Bastianini,

1008
00:55:56,876 --> 00:55:58,608
discuss a possible role

1009
00:55:58,610 --> 00:56:03,146
as mediators
between us and Germany,

1010
00:56:03,148 --> 00:56:05,218
and find out their price?

1011
00:56:18,962 --> 00:56:21,098
(sighs)

1012
00:56:22,033 --> 00:56:23,498
Sir.

1013
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:25,067
(radio warbling)

1014
00:56:25,069 --> 00:56:27,206
(indistinct chatter over radio)

1015
00:56:39,983 --> 00:56:43,251
(static droning and warbling)

1016
00:56:43,253 --> 00:56:45,986
- Mr. President.
- ROOSEVELT: Winston.

1017
00:56:45,988 --> 00:56:48,356
(laughing):
Franklin.

1018
00:56:48,358 --> 00:56:50,992
- How are you?
- Fine. Fine.

1019
00:56:50,994 --> 00:56:52,494
How are you, Prime Minister?

1020
00:56:52,496 --> 00:56:55,062
Oh, I-I'm in fine fettle.

1021
00:56:55,064 --> 00:56:56,196
Fine fettle.

1022
00:56:56,198 --> 00:56:58,299
Uh... uh, listen.

1023
00:56:58,301 --> 00:57:03,304
I'm, uh, uh, telephoning
about your, uh, navy ships.

1024
00:57:03,306 --> 00:57:06,172
If you could loan us
just, uh...

1025
00:57:06,174 --> 00:57:09,275
uh, 50 older destroyers.

1026
00:57:09,277 --> 00:57:12,947
- Ah, yes.
- Or even 40 would do.

1027
00:57:12,949 --> 00:57:15,014
Well, I, uh...

1028
00:57:15,016 --> 00:57:17,250
I did ask around,

1029
00:57:17,252 --> 00:57:20,486
but just not possible,
I'm afraid.

1030
00:57:20,488 --> 00:57:25,325
The Neutrality Act we signed
last year has tied my hands.

1031
00:57:25,327 --> 00:57:27,459
Just can't swing it.

1032
00:57:27,461 --> 00:57:28,428
I tried.

1033
00:57:28,430 --> 00:57:30,899
Uh, well, can I, uh, um...

1034
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:36,169
Do I have your, uh, permission,

1035
00:57:36,171 --> 00:57:38,537
uh, to send, uh,
an aircraft carrier

1036
00:57:38,539 --> 00:57:41,039
to pick up the P-40
fighter planes

1037
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:43,177
we purchased from you?

1038
00:57:46,279 --> 00:57:48,179
Mr. President?

1039
00:57:48,181 --> 00:57:50,681
Well, you-you've
got me there again.

1040
00:57:50,683 --> 00:57:53,451
New law preventing
transshipment

1041
00:57:53,453 --> 00:57:55,387
of military equipment.

1042
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:57,688
Uh, but we paid for them.

1043
00:57:57,690 --> 00:58:00,458
We-we paid for them
with the money that we...

1044
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:02,427
that we borrowed from you.

1045
00:58:02,429 --> 00:58:06,334
I'm so, so sorry, Winston.

1046
00:58:10,135 --> 00:58:13,770
I need not impress
upon you the...

1047
00:58:13,772 --> 00:58:19,410
the trouble faced
by the Western Hemisphere,

1048
00:58:19,412 --> 00:58:23,714
uh, without your support
in some fashion.

1049
00:58:23,716 --> 00:58:25,482
I know. I know.

1050
00:58:25,484 --> 00:58:28,488
You are on my mind
day and night.

1051
00:58:30,589 --> 00:58:34,356
Look, we could possibly...

1052
00:58:34,358 --> 00:58:36,393
Uh, Mr. President...

1053
00:58:36,395 --> 00:58:38,228
Uh, I-I mean to say...

1054
00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:43,333
We are facing, uh,
the gravest odds.

1055
00:58:43,335 --> 00:58:45,235
We could take your planes

1056
00:58:45,237 --> 00:58:47,637
to about a mile
from the Canadian border.

1057
00:58:47,639 --> 00:58:50,472
- Hmm?
- And then, if you send across

1058
00:58:50,474 --> 00:58:54,778
a team of horses from Canada...
nothing motorized...

1059
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:58,516
then you could pull them
over the border yourself.

1060
00:59:00,084 --> 00:59:02,020
How does that sound?

1061
00:59:05,221 --> 00:59:06,821
Horses?

1062
00:59:06,823 --> 00:59:10,491
Um, you-you did say, uh,

1063
00:59:10,493 --> 00:59:13,495
a-a team of horses?

1064
00:59:13,497 --> 00:59:16,799
Well, I guess you could
push them yourself.

1065
00:59:16,801 --> 00:59:19,437
Damn things have wheels.

1066

1068
00:59:26,708 --> 00:59:29,712
We could do that,
Prime Minister.

1069
00:59:32,715 --> 00:59:34,350
Prime Minister?

1070
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:40,655
Uh, uh, anything you could do
at this time,

1071
00:59:40,657 --> 00:59:44,224
uh, Franklin,
would be most welcome.

Prime Minister, would you
like to... Prime Minister?

(clears throat)
I...

1125
01:03:17,864 --> 01:03:20,864
should like to discuss...
(clears throat)

1126
01:03:20,866 --> 01:03:23,768
I have been asked
if plans should be drawn

1127
01:03:23,770 --> 01:03:29,373
to evacuate myself
and my family to Canada.

1128
01:03:29,375 --> 01:03:32,246
I would like to know the
opinion of our prime minister.

1129
01:03:33,546 --> 01:03:35,913
Well, my opinion would be
that you must do

1130
01:03:35,915 --> 01:03:38,783
what you feel
is right for yourself,

1131
01:03:38,785 --> 01:03:42,920
your family and the nation.

1132
01:03:42,922 --> 01:03:47,057
I mean, your survival
is paramount.

1133
01:03:47,059 --> 01:03:48,992
Prime ministers... huh,

1134
01:03:48,994 --> 01:03:52,928
well, we seem to come and go
at an astonishing rate.

1135
01:03:52,930 --> 01:03:56,499
Your position
in Parliament, I...

1136
01:03:56,501 --> 01:03:58,804
I'm told, is not strong.

1137
01:04:00,338 --> 01:04:02,805
Uh, my party...

1138
01:04:02,807 --> 01:04:08,676
resents the way Chamberlain
was pushed aside.

1139
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:10,712
And many others doubt me.

1140
01:04:10,714 --> 01:04:12,080
They want Halifax still,

1141
01:04:12,082 --> 01:04:14,583
but why get rid
of the organ grinder

1142
01:04:14,585 --> 01:04:15,951
and replace him
with the monkey?

1143
01:04:15,953 --> 01:04:20,324
Lord Halifax is a close
personal friend of mine.

1144
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:25,094
(Winston clears throat softly)

1145
01:04:25,096 --> 01:04:27,299
I am unwanted.

1146
01:04:29,433 --> 01:04:33,637
I-I've never been trusted
since the Gallipoli campaign.

1147
01:04:34,637 --> 01:04:36,671
Unwanted.

1148
01:04:36,673 --> 01:04:39,439
Perhaps it's because
you scare people.

1149
01:04:39,441 --> 01:04:40,575
Who?

1150
01:04:40,577 --> 01:04:41,845
You scare me.

1151
01:04:42,745 --> 01:04:46,079
What nonsense. (chuckles)

1152
01:04:46,081 --> 01:04:49,517
What could possibly
be scary about me?

1153
01:04:49,519 --> 01:04:52,720
One never knows what's going
to come out of your mouth next.

1154
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:54,588
Something that will flatter,

1155
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:56,725
something that will wound.

1156
01:04:59,494 --> 01:05:01,594
(dog whining)

1157
01:05:01,596 --> 01:05:05,667
My emotions are unbridled.

1158
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:09,603
A wildness in the blood,

1159
01:05:09,605 --> 01:05:13,672
I share with my father.

1160
01:05:13,674 --> 01:05:16,877
- And my mother also.
- (dog whining)

1161
01:05:16,879 --> 01:05:20,948
We lacked, uh,
the gift of temperance.

1162
01:05:22,483 --> 01:05:23,982
Were you close to your parents?

1163
01:05:23,984 --> 01:05:28,653
M-My mother was glamorous,

1164
01:05:28,655 --> 01:05:31,689
but perhaps too widely loved.

1165
01:05:31,691 --> 01:05:36,629
My father was like God...

1166
01:05:36,631 --> 01:05:38,800
busy elsewhere.

1167
01:05:39,901 --> 01:05:41,200
Hmm.

1168
01:05:41,202 --> 01:05:44,371
(man speaking German
over radio broadcast)

1169
01:05:59,719 --> 01:06:01,755
(German broadcast stops)

1170
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:11,798
(phone ringing)

1171
01:06:20,506 --> 01:06:22,805
- (quiet chatter)
- WINSTON: Good day, gentlemen.

1172
01:06:22,807 --> 01:06:25,609
- Prime Minister.
- I have, uh, asked the...

1173
01:06:25,611 --> 01:06:28,745
uh, minister for war
to join us.

1174
01:06:28,747 --> 01:06:32,514
Um, uh, Neville,
would you, um...

1175
01:06:32,516 --> 01:06:34,217
Anthony.

1176
01:06:34,219 --> 01:06:35,818
(grunts)

1177
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:40,690
Obviously, uh, we are in
a dangerous situation.

1178
01:06:40,692 --> 01:06:42,992
But I am assured
by the French premier

1179
01:06:42,994 --> 01:06:45,994
that while some, uh,
German tank units

1180
01:06:45,996 --> 01:06:48,563
have reached the sea,

1181
01:06:48,565 --> 01:06:50,999
the situation generally seems
to be well in hand.

1182
01:06:51,001 --> 01:06:54,070
What news from Calais?

1183
01:06:54,072 --> 01:06:55,937
The garrison attacked
but was forced back

1184
01:06:55,939 --> 01:06:58,873
and is now surrounded
on all sides.

1185
01:06:58,875 --> 01:07:01,810
They're being shelled
and bombed mercilessly.

1186
01:07:01,812 --> 01:07:03,915
Casualties are at 60%.

1187
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:08,919
Hmm.

1188
01:07:14,691 --> 01:07:16,725
Prime Minister.

1189
01:07:16,727 --> 01:07:18,830
The question of peace talks.

1190
01:07:19,829 --> 01:07:21,595
Oh, we must hold our nerve.

1191
01:07:21,597 --> 01:07:26,867
Signal only that we intend
to fight it out until the end.

1192
01:07:26,869 --> 01:07:29,068
A peace offer, uh,

1193
01:07:29,070 --> 01:07:31,005
- telegraphs our weakness.
- Agreed.

1194
01:07:31,007 --> 01:07:33,541
And even if we were beaten,
we should be no worse off

1195
01:07:33,543 --> 01:07:36,043
than we should be if we were
now to abandon the struggle.

1196
01:07:36,045 --> 01:07:37,945
Let us therefore avoid

1197
01:07:37,947 --> 01:07:41,282
being dragged
down the slippery slope

1198
01:07:41,284 --> 01:07:43,982
with talk
of a negotiated peace.

1199
01:07:43,984 --> 01:07:46,085
Slippery slope? The only...

1200
01:07:46,087 --> 01:07:49,221
- I suspect Italy and Germany...
- The only slippery slope...

1201
01:07:49,223 --> 01:07:51,658
...wish to get us so deeply
involved in negotiations

1202
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:54,326
- that we should be unable to turn back.
- Nonsense.

1203
01:07:54,328 --> 01:07:56,629
- Bastianini informed me...
- I propose...

1204
01:07:56,631 --> 01:07:59,132
- The only slippery slope...
- Would you stop interrupting me

1205
01:07:59,134 --> 01:08:01,871
while I am interrupting you?

1206
01:08:04,705 --> 01:08:07,905
When I chose my War Cabinet,
I took great care

1207
01:08:07,907 --> 01:08:11,309
to surround myself
with old rivals.

1208
01:08:11,311 --> 01:08:13,312
I may have overdone it.
(chuckles)

1209
01:08:13,314 --> 01:08:15,180
Viscount Halifax,

1210
01:08:15,182 --> 01:08:19,817
the approach you propose is...
it's-it's not only...

1211
01:08:19,819 --> 01:08:21,920
it's futile,

1212
01:08:21,922 --> 01:08:24,055
but it involves us
in a deadly danger.

1213
01:08:24,057 --> 01:08:25,890
The deadly danger here

1214
01:08:25,892 --> 01:08:30,931
is this romantic fantasy
of fighting to the end.

1215
01:08:32,165 --> 01:08:33,931
What is the end,

1216
01:08:33,933 --> 01:08:36,537
if not the destruction
of all things?

1217
01:08:37,636 --> 01:08:38,936
There's nothing heroic

1218
01:08:38,938 --> 01:08:41,138
in going down fighting
if it can be avoided.

1219
01:08:41,140 --> 01:08:44,842
Nothing even remotely patriotic
in death or glory

1220
01:08:44,844 --> 01:08:46,977
if the odds are firmly
on the former.

1221
01:08:46,979 --> 01:08:50,047
Nothing inglorious in trying
to shorten a war

1222
01:08:50,049 --> 01:08:51,949
that we are clearly losing.

1223
01:08:51,951 --> 01:08:54,752
Losing?!
Europe is still...

1224
01:08:54,754 --> 01:08:56,322
Europe is lost.

1225
01:09:03,094 --> 01:09:07,096
And before our forces
are wiped out completely,

1226
01:09:07,098 --> 01:09:09,164
now is the time to negotiate,

1227
01:09:09,166 --> 01:09:12,571
in order to obtain
the best conditions possible.

1228
01:09:14,106 --> 01:09:16,172
Hitler will not insist
on outrageous terms.

1229
01:09:16,174 --> 01:09:17,774
He will know
his own weaknesses.

1230
01:09:17,776 --> 01:09:19,141
He will be reasonable.

1231
01:09:19,143 --> 01:09:21,310
When will the lesson
be learned?

1232
01:09:21,312 --> 01:09:24,249
When will
the lesson be learned?!

1233
01:09:25,749 --> 01:09:27,983
How many more dictators

1234
01:09:27,985 --> 01:09:31,353
must be, uh, wooed, appeased...

1235
01:09:31,355 --> 01:09:33,756
good God,
given immense privileges...

1236
01:09:33,758 --> 01:09:35,924
before we learn?

1237
01:09:35,926 --> 01:09:38,993
You cannot reason with a tiger

1238
01:09:38,995 --> 01:09:41,999
when your head is in its mouth!

1239
01:09:43,267 --> 01:09:44,732
Prime Minister.

1240
01:09:44,734 --> 01:09:47,870
Winston. Winston.

1241
01:09:48,937 --> 01:09:50,270
Yesterday,
you gave permission...

1242
01:09:50,272 --> 01:09:51,773
What permission?

1243
01:09:51,775 --> 01:09:53,340
For me to meet Bastianini.

1244
01:09:53,342 --> 01:09:56,044
- I sanctioned the theoretical exploration...
- Theoretical?

1245
01:09:56,046 --> 01:09:58,446
...of what price Italy
would ask. Nothing more.

1246
01:09:58,448 --> 01:10:00,682
- I did not sanction any...
- If you will not permit

1247
01:10:00,684 --> 01:10:02,849
further exploration
of a peace agreement,

1248
01:10:02,851 --> 01:10:04,184
then you will have
my resignation.

1249
01:10:04,186 --> 01:10:05,853
Oh, don't be absurd, Edward.

1250
01:10:05,855 --> 01:10:09,289
- I need you. You know I do.
- I will not stand by

1251
01:10:09,291 --> 01:10:12,858
to watch another generation
of young men die

1252
01:10:12,860 --> 01:10:14,326
at the bloody altar
of your hubris.

1253
01:10:14,328 --> 01:10:17,164
Oh, and you would have us
die as lambs!

1254
01:10:17,166 --> 01:10:18,898
Was Gallipoli
not enough for you?

1255
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:20,701
How dare you!

1256
01:10:20,703 --> 01:10:24,370
Our troops were chewing
barbed wire in Flanders,

1257
01:10:24,372 --> 01:10:26,306
and I saw it!

1258
01:10:26,308 --> 01:10:30,076
Opening a second front,
outflanking the Turks

1259
01:10:30,078 --> 01:10:32,744
was a... a serious
military idea,

1260
01:10:32,746 --> 01:10:34,914
and it could have
damn well worked if the...

1261
01:10:34,916 --> 01:10:36,949
if the admirals
and the First Sea Lord

1262
01:10:36,951 --> 01:10:40,656
hadn't dithered away
our element of surprise.

1263
01:10:44,459 --> 01:10:46,258
Choice is yours, Winston.

1264
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:48,793
You have 24 hours
to enter into peace talks,

1265
01:10:48,795 --> 01:10:50,665
or I shall resign.

1266
01:11:04,811 --> 01:11:06,477
HALIFAX:
I told him.

1267
01:11:06,479 --> 01:11:08,046
It shook him.

1268
01:11:08,048 --> 01:11:10,148
I imagine it did.

1269
01:11:10,150 --> 01:11:12,117
Gave him 24 hours.

1270
01:11:12,119 --> 01:11:15,220
I don't expect he'll agree,
so I shall resign first.

1271
01:11:15,222 --> 01:11:17,154
You then follow...
that's critical if we're

1272
01:11:17,156 --> 01:11:19,989
to trigger a vote
of no confidence in the House.

1273
01:11:19,991 --> 01:11:21,994
I shall announce it.

1274
01:11:22,994 --> 01:11:25,230
The king will back us.

1275
01:11:27,365 --> 01:11:29,334

Prime Minister.

1277
01:11:42,414 --> 01:11:44,080
I wonder
if we might schedule you

1278
01:11:44,082 --> 01:11:45,247
to address the Outer Cabinet.

ANNOUNCER (over radio):
Today, the Admiralty

1281
01:11:48,453 --> 01:11:51,019
have made an order
requesting all owners

1282
01:11:51,021 --> 01:11:52,522
of self-propelled
pleasure craft

1283

between 30 and 100 feet
in length

1284
01:11:55,292 --> 01:11:58,861
to send all particulars
to the Admiralty immediately...

1285
01:11:58,863 --> 01:12:01,030
To Brigadier Nicholson.

1286

you continue to exist

01:12:19,916 --> 01:12:23,019
to our forces at Dunkirk.

1292
01:12:25,488 --> 01:12:30,926
Have the greatest possible
admiration

1293
01:12:30,928 --> 01:12:33,396
for your splendid stand.

1294
01:12:38,166 --> 01:12:41,135
Your evacuation, however,

1295
01:12:41,137 --> 01:12:44,206
will not take place.

I repeat...

1297
01:12:53,049 --> 01:12:56,051
will not take place.

Sign.

WINSTON (stammering):
At ease, gentlemen.

1314
01:14:26,071 --> 01:14:28,174
Now...

1315
01:14:30,541 --> 01:14:33,309
The German army controls
every French port

1316
01:14:33,311 --> 01:14:35,677
except Dunkirk here
and Calais here to the west,

1317
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:38,480
where the garrison
under Brigadier Nicholson

1318
01:14:38,482 --> 01:14:42,618
is drawing fire and delaying
the German advance on Dunkirk.

1319
01:14:42,620 --> 01:14:46,422
At both points,
our troops are encircled.

1320
01:14:46,424 --> 01:14:48,457
Now, we are still trying

1321
01:14:48,459 --> 01:14:51,025
to clear Dunkirk Harbor
of wrecked ships

1322
01:14:51,027 --> 01:14:54,128
so that we can then land
the boats we need to get our...

1323
01:14:54,130 --> 01:14:55,462
our boys off those beaches.

1324
01:14:55,464 --> 01:14:58,433
But enemy aircraft
is attacking us constantly.

1325
01:14:58,435 --> 01:15:03,337
Our-our only hope in Dunkirk
is thick cloud cover

1326
01:15:03,339 --> 01:15:06,974
to thwart these attacks,
but the skies remain clear.

1327
01:15:06,976 --> 01:15:11,345
And even then,
I am told we will need a...

1328
01:15:11,347 --> 01:15:15,485
a miracle to get even
ten percent of our men out.

1329

01:24:30,516 --> 01:24:32,184

01:24:36,255 --> 01:24:38,989

01:24:43,662 --> 01:24:45,865
...uh, uh, t-to consider...

1465
01:24:46,797 --> 01:24:47,998

1467
01:24:55,973 --> 01:24:58,210
...to consider...

1468
01:25:00,310 --> 01:25:03,212
...whether it-it was...

1469
01:25:03,214 --> 01:25:05,951
Will that be all
for tonight, sir?

1470
01:25:07,884 --> 01:25:09,250
(Winston stammering)

1471
01:25:09,252 --> 01:25:13,254
...whether it was, uh,
part of my duty

1472
01:25:13,256 --> 01:25:17,027
e-e-entering into...

...that corporal...

1477
01:25:31,307 --> 01:25:34,777
(Hitler speech plays faintly
as voice-over)

1478
01:25:36,312 --> 01:25:39,782
...uh, that child.

1479
01:25:42,952 --> 01:25:44,718
(grumbling)

1480
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:46,953
Monster of wickedness.

1481
01:25:46,955 --> 01:25:48,755
(Hitler speech grows louder
in volume)

1482
01:25:48,757 --> 01:25:49,922
That butcher.

1483
01:25:49,924 --> 01:25:52,059
That savage.

1484
01:25:52,061 --> 01:25:56,031
Monstrous savage.

1485
01:25:58,232 --> 01:26:01,137
(muttering)

1486
01:26:02,338 --> 01:26:04,107
That wicked...

1487
01:26:05,373 --> 01:26:07,772
Housepainter.

1488
01:26:07,774 --> 01:26:09,877
(Hitler speech continues)

1489
01:26:10,912 --> 01:26:12,911
Housepainter!

1490
01:26:12,913 --> 01:26:14,550
(Hitler speech stops)

1491
01:26:17,085 --> 01:26:18,554
Oh.

1492
01:26:19,721 --> 01:26:22,958
Uh, uh, where... where were we?

1493
01:26:26,226 --> 01:26:27,930
Well?

1494
01:26:30,064 --> 01:26:32,567
I didn't understand you, sir.

1495
01:26:33,700 --> 01:26:35,366
You were...

1496
01:26:35,368 --> 01:26:36,836
Were?

1497
01:26:37,804 --> 01:26:39,204
You were mumbling.

1498
01:26:39,206 --> 01:26:41,175
"Mumbling."

1499
01:26:45,978 --> 01:26:49,149
Th-Th-The right words...

1500
01:26:50,716 --> 01:26:52,750
...won't come.

1501
01:26:52,752 --> 01:26:54,084
They will come, sir.

1502
01:26:54,086 --> 01:26:57,056
No one can put words together
like you.

1503
01:27:07,833 --> 01:27:09,134
Oh.

1504
01:27:13,738 --> 01:27:15,174
(sighs)

1505
01:27:18,942 --> 01:27:22,080
Uh, your beau?

1506
01:27:23,013 --> 01:27:24,917
My brother.

1507
01:27:26,685 --> 01:27:29,117
Where is he now?

1508
01:27:29,119 --> 01:27:32,854
He was falling back on Dunkirk.

1509
01:27:32,856 --> 01:27:35,026
But he never made it.

1510
01:27:59,248 --> 01:28:01,184
What?

1511
01:28:05,922 --> 01:28:08,692
Just looking at you.

1512

You know something?

I'm aware in this moment
of feeling angry.

1533
01:30:25,121 --> 01:30:27,325
Bloody angry.

1534

Winston, darling.

1536
01:30:39,870 --> 01:30:42,035
There's someone to see you.

1537
01:30:42,037 --> 01:30:43,540
You have a visitor.

1538
01:30:50,513 --> 01:30:52,316
(grunts quietly)

1539
01:30:54,482 --> 01:30:56,884
My darling,
you have the full weight

1540
01:30:56,886 --> 01:30:58,518
of the world on your shoulders.

1541
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:01,220
- I... I...
- No, I know, I know.

1542
01:31:01,222 --> 01:31:04,957
But these inner battles

1543
01:31:04,959 --> 01:31:08,228
have actually trained you

1544
01:31:08,230 --> 01:31:10,430
for this very moment.

1545
01:31:10,432 --> 01:31:13,266
You are strong
because you are imperfect.

1546
01:31:13,268 --> 01:31:18,106
You are wise
because you have doubts.

1547
01:31:19,641 --> 01:31:22,244
Now, shall I let him in?

1548
01:31:23,977 --> 01:31:25,213
Uh, who?

1549
01:31:26,114 --> 01:31:27,280
The king.

1550
01:31:27,282 --> 01:31:29,982
Which king?

1551
01:31:29,984 --> 01:31:31,549
Our king?

1552
01:31:31,551 --> 01:31:35,156
Well, if it isn't him,
it's a marvelous impersonation.

(door closes)

1554
01:31:44,230 --> 01:31:46,231
Mr. Churchill.

1555
01:31:46,233 --> 01:31:49,601
I hope you can forgive
the late hour, but...

1556
01:31:49,603 --> 01:31:54,972
your wife thought tonight
would be a good time.

1557

Shall we sit?

1558
01:31:56,475 --> 01:31:57,976
Oh, yes.

1559
01:31:57,978 --> 01:32:00,413
Uh, uh, please. Um...

1560
01:32:03,516 --> 01:32:06,017
Some-Something to drink,
perhaps?

1561
01:32:06,019 --> 01:32:07,420
No.

1562
01:32:12,124 --> 01:32:14,091
(coughs, clears throat)

1563
01:32:14,093 --> 01:32:16,392
I... (grunts)

1564
01:32:16,394 --> 01:32:20,530
received a visit.

1565
01:32:20,532 --> 01:32:21,731
From?

1566
01:32:21,733 --> 01:32:23,299
Viscount Halifax.

1567
01:32:23,301 --> 01:32:27,471
It appears that the prospect
of a peace deal

1568
01:32:27,473 --> 01:32:31,573
has increased dramatically.

1569
01:32:31,575 --> 01:32:37,646
The-the War Cabinet is drafting
a letter to Mussolini,

1570
01:32:37,648 --> 01:32:43,222
asking him to broker talks
with Herr Hitler.

1571
01:32:46,290 --> 01:32:49,695
Then Halifax was correct.

1572
01:32:51,529 --> 01:32:53,762
I-I should like
to know your mind.

1573
01:32:53,764 --> 01:32:57,198
It would be helpful
to know yours first.

1574
01:32:57,200 --> 01:33:01,204
I should like
to know it myself.

1575
01:33:02,739 --> 01:33:05,072
Nations... (clears throat)

1576
01:33:05,074 --> 01:33:09,344
which go down fighting
rise again, and those...

1577
01:33:09,346 --> 01:33:11,746
that surrender tamely
are finished.

1578
01:33:11,748 --> 01:33:13,216
Belgium?

1579
01:33:14,118 --> 01:33:15,617
- Collapsed.
- Norway?

1580
01:33:15,619 --> 01:33:17,352
Holland.

1581
01:33:17,354 --> 01:33:19,152
France any hour.

1582
01:33:19,154 --> 01:33:20,620
And the mood of Parliament?

1583
01:33:20,622 --> 01:33:22,056
Fear. Panic.

1584
01:33:22,058 --> 01:33:23,493
And you?

1585
01:33:24,426 --> 01:33:26,697
Are you not afraid?

1586
01:33:28,230 --> 01:33:31,635
I am, most terribly.

1587
01:33:33,036 --> 01:33:38,638
Support in the War Cabinet

1588
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:42,374
for the campaign of resistance

1589
01:33:42,376 --> 01:33:44,045
has collapsed.

1590
01:33:49,751 --> 01:33:51,618
(sighs)

1591
01:33:51,620 --> 01:33:57,526
Uh, later today, I-I will
address the House accordingly.

1592
01:34:08,169 --> 01:34:10,739
You have my support.

1593
01:34:17,111 --> 01:34:19,410
Your Majesty?

1594
01:34:19,412 --> 01:34:22,483
You have my support.

1595
01:34:24,418 --> 01:34:26,685
I confess, I...

1596
01:34:26,687 --> 01:34:30,688
had some reservations
about you at first, but...

1597
01:34:30,690 --> 01:34:34,425
while some in this country
dreaded your appointment,

1598
01:34:34,427 --> 01:34:38,763
none... none dreaded it
like Adolf Hitler.

1599
01:34:38,765 --> 01:34:43,434
Whomever can strike fear
into that brute heart

1600
01:34:43,436 --> 01:34:46,170
is worthy of all of our trust.

1601
01:34:46,172 --> 01:34:47,438
We shall work together.

1602
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:51,141
You shall have my support
at any hour.

1603
01:34:51,143 --> 01:34:53,543
Beat the buggers.

1604
01:34:53,545 --> 01:34:56,379
I will go to Parliament.

1605
01:34:56,381 --> 01:34:59,883
But without support
in my own party,

1606
01:34:59,885 --> 01:35:02,454
I must sue for peace.

1607
01:35:06,358 --> 01:35:07,723
You once gave me some advice.

1608
01:35:07,725 --> 01:35:11,495
Perhaps I can...
I can give you some.

1609
01:35:11,497 --> 01:35:13,362
Go to the people.

1610
01:35:13,364 --> 01:35:15,665
Let them instruct you.

1611
01:35:15,667 --> 01:35:18,901
Quite silently,
they usually do.

1612
01:35:18,903 --> 01:35:21,603
But tell them...

1613
01:35:21,605 --> 01:35:24,440
the truth unvarnished.

1614
01:35:24,442 --> 01:35:26,741
If invasion is imminent,

1615
01:35:26,743 --> 01:35:29,477
if our troops in France
are lost,

1616
01:35:29,479 --> 01:35:32,616
they must be prepared.

1617
01:35:34,519 --> 01:35:38,353
On certain matters,

1618
01:35:38,355 --> 01:35:43,223
I-I have very few people
with whom I can...

1619
01:35:43,225 --> 01:35:45,760
talk frankly.

1620
01:35:45,762 --> 01:35:47,697
Perhaps now we have each other.

1621
01:35:49,665 --> 01:35:52,367
And I no longer scare you?

1622
01:35:52,369 --> 01:35:54,401
- A little.
- (chuckles)

1623
01:35:54,403 --> 01:35:56,406
But I can cope.

1624
01:36:06,382 --> 01:36:07,914
RAMSAY:
We are ready. More or less.

1625
01:36:07,916 --> 01:36:10,617
WINSTON (over phone):
More or less what, Bertie?

1626
01:36:10,619 --> 01:36:12,386
Give me a number.

01:46:44,259 --> 01:46:48,395
I shall address the House

1790
01:46:48,397 --> 01:46:53,132
on the matter
of our nation's security.

1791
01:46:53,134 --> 01:46:56,469
At this very moment,
the War Cabinet

1792
01:46:56,471 --> 01:47:00,540
is drafting papers
that lay out a willingness

1793
01:47:00,542 --> 01:47:04,976
to enter into peace talks
with Herr Hitler,

1794
01:47:04,978 --> 01:47:07,279
via his, uh...

1795
01:47:07,281 --> 01:47:10,015
his lackey, Mussolini.

1796
01:47:10,017 --> 01:47:11,818
(quiet murmuring)

1797
01:47:11,820 --> 01:47:16,988
I have thought very carefully
in these last days

1798
01:47:16,990 --> 01:47:20,224
whether it was part
of my duty

1799
01:47:20,226 --> 01:47:25,132
to consider entering
into negotiations with...

1800
01:47:28,836 --> 01:47:31,038
...with that man.

1801
01:47:32,840 --> 01:47:35,307
Uh, but-but then I, uh...

1802
01:47:35,309 --> 01:47:37,041
(grunts)

1803
01:47:37,043 --> 01:47:41,045
I spoke with, um... mm...

1804
01:47:41,047 --> 01:47:43,082
um...

1805
01:47:44,183 --> 01:47:46,316
Oliver Wilson,

1806
01:47:46,318 --> 01:47:49,119
Mrs. Jessie Sutton,

1807
01:47:49,121 --> 01:47:53,456
Mrs. Abigail Walker,

1808
01:47:53,458 --> 01:47:55,325
Marcus Peters,

1809
01:47:55,327 --> 01:47:58,161
Maurice, uh, Baker,

1810
01:47:58,163 --> 01:47:59,897
Alice Simpson

1811
01:47:59,899 --> 01:48:02,633
and Miss Margaret Jerome.

1812
01:48:02,635 --> 01:48:05,201
Brave, good, true citizens
of this kingdom.

1813
01:48:05,203 --> 01:48:09,338
And they argued strongly
that it was, uh, idle to think,

1814
01:48:09,340 --> 01:48:12,307
if we tried to make peace now,

1815
01:48:12,309 --> 01:48:17,146
we should get better terms
than if we fought it out.

1816
01:48:17,148 --> 01:48:22,017
The Germans, Mr. Baker felt,

1817
01:48:22,019 --> 01:48:25,888
uh, would demand,
in-in the name of disarmament,

1818
01:48:25,890 --> 01:48:27,489
our naval bases and much else,

1819
01:48:27,491 --> 01:48:29,557
- and I think he's right.
- (quiet murmuring)

1820
01:48:29,559 --> 01:48:33,628
Jessie Sutton,
speaking for many,

1821
01:48:33,630 --> 01:48:37,365
uh, believes
we would then become a...

1822
01:48:37,367 --> 01:48:39,368
- a slave state.
- (murmuring)

1823
01:48:39,370 --> 01:48:43,639
A... a British government
which would be Hitler's puppet.

1824
01:48:43,641 --> 01:48:47,975
A... a government set up
under... under Mosley

1825
01:48:47,977 --> 01:48:50,378
- or some such person.
- No, no.

1826
01:48:50,380 --> 01:48:54,047
And I join with them in asking
a... a further question.

1827
01:48:54,049 --> 01:48:57,385
A question I-I now put to you.

1828
01:48:57,387 --> 01:49:01,892
Where should we be
at the end of all that?

1829
01:49:06,963 --> 01:49:08,629
Some might benefit.

1830
01:49:08,631 --> 01:49:13,000
I mean, the powerful might
be able to parlay good terms,

1831
01:49:13,002 --> 01:49:15,603
uh, preserved
in their country redoubts,

1832
01:49:15,605 --> 01:49:20,439
out of sight of the swastika
flying over...

1833
01:49:20,441 --> 01:49:23,209
- over Buckingham Palace!
- (murmuring)

1834
01:49:23,211 --> 01:49:25,445
Over Windsor!

1835
01:49:25,447 --> 01:49:28,013
And, uh, draped
on these very buildings!

1836
01:49:28,015 --> 01:49:30,150
- Never! Never!
- No! No!

1837
01:49:30,152 --> 01:49:33,186
So I come to you...

1838
01:49:33,188 --> 01:49:37,223
I come to you

1839
01:49:37,225 --> 01:49:41,496
to learn your minds
in this grave hour.

1840
01:49:42,429 --> 01:49:44,996
You see,
it was pointed out to me

1841
01:49:44,998 --> 01:49:49,133
by my new friends
th-that you might even rise up

1842
01:49:49,135 --> 01:49:52,471
and-and... and tear me down
were I for one moment

1843
01:49:52,473 --> 01:49:55,039
to contemplate parlay
or surrender.

1844
01:49:55,041 --> 01:49:57,343
- (applause)
- Huh?

1845
01:49:57,345 --> 01:50:00,012
(murmuring)

1846
01:50:00,014 --> 01:50:01,213
Were they wrong?

1847
01:50:01,215 --> 01:50:02,448
GROUP:
No!

1848
01:50:02,450 --> 01:50:04,083
- Were they wrong?
- No!

1849
01:50:04,085 --> 01:50:05,583
W-Were they wrong?

1850
01:50:05,585 --> 01:50:07,718
- No!
- Thank you. Thank you.

1851
01:50:07,720 --> 01:50:09,686
Then I have heard you.

1852
01:50:09,688 --> 01:50:11,659
I have heard you.

1853
01:50:13,526 --> 01:50:17,995
It appears to be your will also

1854
01:50:17,997 --> 01:50:23,001
that if this long island story
of ours is to end at last,

1855
01:50:23,003 --> 01:50:27,070
then let it end only
when each one of us

1856
01:50:27,072 --> 01:50:31,341
lies choking in his own blood
upon the ground!

1857
01:50:31,343 --> 01:50:34,778
- Yes! - Bravo!
- (cheering and applause)

1858
01:50:34,780 --> 01:50:36,449
Yes.

1859
01:50:38,484 --> 01:50:41,018
WINSTON: <i>And when I asked
to know their minds,</i>

1860
01:50:41,020 --> 01:50:42,618
there occurred
a demonstration which,

1861
01:50:42,620 --> 01:50:45,354
considering the character
of the gathering,

1862
01:50:45,356 --> 01:50:47,357
quite surprised me.

1863
01:50:47,359 --> 01:50:52,095
There is no doubt
that if we falter at all

1864
01:50:52,097 --> 01:50:54,330
in the leading of the nation,

1865
01:50:54,332 --> 01:50:57,232
we should all be hurled
out of office.

1866
01:50:57,234 --> 01:50:59,134
I am sure now
that every minister

1867
01:50:59,136 --> 01:51:00,669
on both sides of the House

1868
01:51:00,671 --> 01:51:02,804
is... is ready
to be killed quite soon,

1869
01:51:02,806 --> 01:51:06,375
and have all his family
and possessions destroyed,

1870
01:51:06,377 --> 01:51:08,643
rather than give in.

1871
01:51:08,645 --> 01:51:13,182
In this, they represent
almost all the people.

1872
01:51:13,184 --> 01:51:18,620
And it falls to me
in these coming days and months

1873
01:51:18,622 --> 01:51:22,560
to express their sentiments.

1874
01:51:24,594 --> 01:51:29,600
There shall be
no negotiated peace.

1875
01:51:33,235 --> 01:51:36,670
And you must each do now

1876
01:51:36,672 --> 01:51:38,576
as you see fit.

1877

gentlemen... (clears throat)

01:51:46,615 --> 01:51:50,516
I believe I am due
to address Parliament.

1879
01:51:50,518 --> 01:51:54,288
And I have yet to write a...
a-a word of my speech.

1880
01:51:54,290 --> 01:51:56,559
Ah, there's the buggers.

I am in need of you.

1885
01:52:13,575 --> 01:52:16,478
We must both now resign,
force a vote of no confidence.

1886
01:52:17,678 --> 01:52:20,313
Well, let us go
to the Commons first, uh...

join our colleagues.

1948
01:56:11,869 --> 01:56:15,504
We shall defend our island,

1949
01:56:15,506 --> 01:56:18,107
whatever the cost may be.

1950
01:56:18,109 --> 01:56:20,576
Hear, hear.

1951
01:56:20,578 --> 01:56:23,612
We shall fight on the beaches.

1952
01:56:23,614 --> 01:56:27,716
We shall fight
on the landing grounds.

1953
01:56:27,718 --> 01:56:30,818
We shall fight in the fields

1954
01:56:30,820 --> 01:56:33,487
and in the streets.

1955
01:56:33,489 --> 01:56:36,590
We shall fight in the hills.

1956
01:56:36,592 --> 01:56:39,093
We shall never surrender!

(cheering, stomping)

1958
01:56:41,597 --> 01:56:44,734
- Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear.

1959
01:56:48,704 --> 01:56:50,308
And if...

1960
01:56:51,440 --> 01:56:52,908
(whispering):
And if...

1961
01:56:54,042 --> 01:56:56,843
And if...

1962
01:56:56,845 --> 01:57:00,814
which I-I-I do not
for a moment believe,

1963
01:57:00,816 --> 01:57:05,585
this island
or large part of it were...

1964
01:57:05,587 --> 01:57:09,455
were-were subjugated
and starving,

1965
01:57:09,457 --> 01:57:13,761
then our empire
beyond the seas,

1966
01:57:13,763 --> 01:57:18,131
armed and guarded
by the British fleet,

1967
01:57:18,133 --> 01:57:22,435
- would carry on the struggle.
- Hear, hear!

1968
01:57:22,437 --> 01:57:25,438
Until, in God's good time,

1969
01:57:25,440 --> 01:57:30,842
the New World,
with all its power and might,

1970
01:57:30,844 --> 01:57:33,712
steps forth to the rescue

1971
01:57:33,714 --> 01:57:36,815
and the liberation of the old!

Bravo!

Victory!

- (cheering)
- Victory! Victory!

1977
01:58:26,798 --> 01:58:28,198
Changed your mind?

1978
01:58:28,200 --> 01:58:30,967
Those who never change
their mind

1979
01:58:30,969 --> 01:58:34,105
- never change anything.

He mobilized
the English language
