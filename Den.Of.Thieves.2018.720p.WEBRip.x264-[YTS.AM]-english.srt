2
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:10,794
No, no, no, bro! We're not here for you!
Don't even think about it!

3
00:02:10,796 --> 00:02:12,531
Don't you move,
motherfucker!

4
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:14,902
Hands away from the weapon, bro!
Fucking relax!

5
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:19,371
3170. We're being held up.

6
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:22,407
Armor piercing rounds
are chambered in this firearm!

7
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:25,377
Please don't be the asshole
who forces me to use them.

8
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,513
Take your foot off the gas,

9
00:02:27,515 --> 00:02:30,747
press the unlock button,
and step out of the vehicle,

10
00:02:30,749 --> 00:02:32,716
or we will forcibly
remove you!

11
00:02:32,718 --> 00:02:36,022
Fucking do it! Now!

12
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,392
Your choice! Go!

13
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,077
What the fuck!

14
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:01,111
He fucking went for his gun.

15
00:03:01,113 --> 00:03:03,283
He spilled his fucking coffee.

16
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,091
Shit.

17
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:14,094
Gardena, 30 seconds out.

18
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:16,193
Copy.

19
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:17,764
Thirty out. Hustle!

20
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:22,869
- Pop it.
- Ready.

21
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:35,580
Man on!

22
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,786
Out of fucking time.

23
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:43,455
Prepare to engage.

24
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:44,989
Contact right!

25
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:47,558
Range 100. Suppressive fire.

26
00:04:00,105 --> 00:04:01,239
Contact left!

27
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:05,813
Dispatch, 10-97.
LAPD is on scene.

28
00:04:19,427 --> 00:04:20,628
We are under heavy fire!

29
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:43,784
Fuck!

30
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,058
Motherfucker!

31
00:05:00,866 --> 00:05:02,902
Whoa, whoa.
I got you. I got you.

32
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,089
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

33
00:05:43,275 --> 00:05:44,741
What the fuck was that?

34
00:05:44,743 --> 00:05:46,210
Did you see him
go for his gun?

35
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:49,417
I don't know.
I just saw Bosco lit him up.

36
00:05:55,921 --> 00:05:58,188
Take the second left
into the tunnel.

37
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,094
Hug the airport.
Take the tunnel.

38
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,777
Go right on Doty.

39
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:21,981
<i>Right on Doty.</i>

40
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:32,116
Make sure you take care
of those weapons.

41
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,188
I don't want any
accidental discharges.

42
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:37,955
- What are you looking at him for?
- Ray.

43
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,222
I'm not talking to him.
I'm talking to you.

44
00:07:39,224 --> 00:07:40,528
What the fuck was that?

45
00:07:49,034 --> 00:07:50,401
What else
did you fuck up, huh?

46
00:07:52,337 --> 00:07:54,241
You sure you were clean
all the way home?

47
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,243
Catch any tails?

48
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,386
Where did Marcus
take those rounds?

49
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:10,723
Femoral artery. He's done.

50
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,562
Well, we knew the risks.

51
00:08:16,564 --> 00:08:18,566
Shit popped off.
We handled it. That's it.

52
00:08:25,837 --> 00:08:26,907
Hey, B.

53
00:08:28,073 --> 00:08:30,073
Get back over there.

54
00:08:30,075 --> 00:08:32,209
See who responded.
It was probably LASD.

55
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:34,744
They'll supersede Gardena,

56
00:08:34,746 --> 00:08:37,251
but if it's Major Crimes,
we've got a problem.

57
00:08:44,592 --> 00:08:46,856
All clear? No GPS?

58
00:08:46,858 --> 00:08:48,928
It's one of the old models, man.
We good.

59
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:52,765
We've got to
get this patched up.

60
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:54,602
We need this clean.

61
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:02,544
You good?

62
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:06,947
We're cop killers now.

63
00:09:32,804 --> 00:09:34,408
Well, that looks
like it hurt.

64
00:09:36,074 --> 00:09:37,076
No?

65
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,644
Good morning,
fellow officers.

66
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:41,979
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

67
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:43,080
Yeah?

68
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,016
I take it he's a bad guy.

69
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:46,816
You mean the guy
with the black body armor,

70
00:09:46,818 --> 00:09:48,819
shotgun, and gas mask?

71
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:51,423
That's very funny.
We know who he is yet?

72
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:52,426
Rough night?

73
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:55,091
Yes. Next subject?

74
00:09:55,093 --> 00:09:56,926
You're not looking
so hot there, bubba.

75
00:09:56,928 --> 00:09:58,863
I think he
looks amazing.

76
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:02,298
You better start downing the POM juice,
big man. We've got a piss test Friday.

77
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,167
Thursday.

78
00:10:04,169 --> 00:10:06,370
What, like you Mormons have been
drinking wheatgrass all fucking month?

79
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:07,838
Please.

80
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,508
You got another one of those?
I'm fucking starving.

81
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,042
Yeah, there's a
couple that don't have blood.

82
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:14,778
I think it's one of the
pinkies with the sprinkles.

83
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,946
- That's some real donut.
- Okay, what's the tally?

84
00:10:16,948 --> 00:10:18,482
Those are horrendous, dude.

85
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:20,884
We've got four dead, six on
the way to the hospital.

86
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:22,887
- But they'll be all right.
- Fuck.

87
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:25,690
Ambushed them as they
were coming to get breakfast.

88
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:27,359
Surrounded the truck.

89
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:30,027
This poor fool right here was trying
to do what he gets paid to do.

90
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:33,398
AP rounds blasted through
the windshield took him out.

91
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,200
They took the truck, Gardena police
lost them under Hawthorne Municipal.

92
00:10:37,202 --> 00:10:38,570
They knew the route.

93
00:10:38,572 --> 00:10:41,539
Picked it because it was
next to Municipal Airport,

94
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:45,044
knew the restricted air space
meant no ghetto bird air support.

95
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:49,979
We're dealing with a different
animal here, boys.

96
00:10:49,981 --> 00:10:52,316
Talk to the armored car company?
What was the haul?

97
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,884
They were en route to a bank
pickup for a Fed drop.

98
00:10:54,886 --> 00:10:55,888
But there was nothing
in the truck.

99
00:10:56,755 --> 00:10:57,924
Nothing in the truck?

100
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,928
They stole a fucking
empty armored truck?

101
00:11:02,227 --> 00:11:03,528
Yup.

102
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,399
Why the fireworks?

103
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:10,270
One of the vics said the messenger went
for his gun. That's when it popped off.

104
00:11:11,405 --> 00:11:12,737
Genius.

105
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:14,739
Okay, the SUV,
what have we got?

106
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:16,508
That's a cold car.

107
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:19,710
VIN's been pried off. Plates are stolen.
No prints on it.

108
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:21,379
They bleach-bombed it.

109
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:26,618
Right. Take it to SID. Tent that fucker.
Swab it. Detail it.

110
00:11:35,093 --> 00:11:38,395
Ah, fuck. I can't deal with
this retard factory this early.

111
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:40,096
One of you guys handle it?

112
00:11:40,098 --> 00:11:41,233
It's all you, bro.

113
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,268
Thank you.

114
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,870
All right, witnesses,
donut shop guy?

115
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,539
He saw them, and they
looked right at him,

116
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,276
but, for some reason,
they left him alone.

117
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:56,980
Okay, pull all video surveillance and
plate readers. Do a Palantir run.

118
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:58,282
Talk to DOT, okay?

119
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:01,552
Pull it all together,
and meet me at the office.

120
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,458
And find me
that fucking truck.

121
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:11,295
Big Nick, original gangsta
cop in the flesh.

122
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:13,565
Lobbin' Bob. Huh?

123
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:15,302
How's that
mean tennis game?

124
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,306
Look at you, man.

125
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:24,141
Where'd you pick that up?
Nice suit.

126
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:27,511
Well, not where you're shopping.
I can't afford it.

127
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:29,946
I mean, how does
a county sheriff

128
00:12:29,948 --> 00:12:32,649
pay for such a beautiful
piece of men's fashion?

129
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:35,018
You kidding me? This piece of shit?
Nah, this is garbage.

130
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,253
Look at you.

131
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,288
This thing's tits!

132
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,658
You must pull all kinds
of ass sporting that, no?

133
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,760
Nick, you know what?
I can't. I can't.

134
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:47,532
It's too early in the morning
for your fucking circus.

135
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:49,834
You just threw
a donut in the hot zone.

136
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:51,602
- No. I did not.
- Yeah, you did.

137
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,671
I did?
That was fucking wrong.

138
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:56,005
It was. I don't like you, Nick, or
how you handle police business...

139
00:12:56,007 --> 00:12:57,810
Hey, hey, hey.
What's up with that?

140
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:00,176
I like you.

141
00:13:00,178 --> 00:13:02,345
Aside from the fact
that you're a vegetarian.

142
00:13:02,347 --> 00:13:04,849
Vegan! I'm a vegan.

143
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:06,950
- Vegetarians, they eat milk...
- Yeah, sorry to hear that.

144
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,018
What are you
doing here anyway, huh?

145
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:12,726
No legal tender was stolen.
It isn't Federal.

146
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,061
Yet.

147
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,799
You're pausing
for dramatic effect?

148
00:13:22,702 --> 00:13:24,372
You're such a big,
bad lieutenant.

149
00:13:25,203 --> 00:13:27,303
- I know. I know.
- Yeah.

150
00:13:27,305 --> 00:13:30,042
Can I go now, Dad?
I'm kind of hungry.

151
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:39,583
So Gardena showed up,
and they secured the scene,

152
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:42,720
and then these clowns
took over.

153
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:44,354
Who are they, LASD?

154
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:47,224
Yeah, Sheriff's. They must be.
Look at this clown right here.

155
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:48,496
He seemed to be in charge.

156
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:05,442
You recognize him?

157
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:07,611
He played football at South.

158
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:10,584
Remember Endo?
Filipino dude the cops killed?

159
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:12,349
Yeah.

160
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,350
That's the cop
who blasted him.

161
00:14:14,352 --> 00:14:16,253
Runs Major Crimes.

162
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:18,091
Get to know your enemy, boys.

163
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:29,899
Who's running this crew?

164
00:14:29,901 --> 00:14:32,470
Probably two, three guys
that can pull this off, max.

165
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:37,442
Why steal an armored truck
with nothing in it?

166
00:14:37,444 --> 00:14:39,610
Bad tip,
they probably botched it.

167
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:41,077
Why didn't they dump it, then?

168
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:43,247
- I'll check the salvage yards.
- All of them.

169
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:47,485
And how'd they know about a transfer
from the casino to the Fed,

170
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:51,821
especially one that wasn't scheduled
through the regular carrier? How?

171
00:14:51,823 --> 00:14:54,325
It was an inside job, bro.
It had to be.

172
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:57,293
Oh, fuck.
Give me the Pepto.

173
00:14:57,295 --> 00:14:59,964
Okay, inside job, but where?

174
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:03,803
Right? Was it the casino, the bank, the
Fed, the fucking donut shop? Where?

175
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:06,406
What about Merrimen?

176
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:11,475
When did he parole again?

177
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:14,280
- Eight months ago.
- Eight months ago?

178
00:15:15,914 --> 00:15:18,816
We need to find
that fucking truck.

179
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:20,850
Have we still got a tail
on that Wilson kid?

180
00:15:20,852 --> 00:15:22,186
Yeah.

181
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:23,186
The one who was
hanging out with Merrimen?

182
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:24,821
What bar did he work in?

183
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:27,825
- Hofbrau.
- Ziggy's Hofbrau.

184
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:29,162
Let's pay him a visit.

185
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:42,676
...some Wi-Fi? No?
We better check his videos.

186
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:46,846
- Thanks.
- All right.

187
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,514
Wolfgang, talk to me.

188
00:15:49,516 --> 00:15:51,548
- Donnie, I'm tapped out.
- No problem.

189
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,182
Put it on my tab, all right?

190
00:15:53,184 --> 00:15:54,784
- Of course, man, I got you.
- Thank you.

191
00:15:54,786 --> 00:15:56,021
Have a good night.

192
00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:09,298
Are we doing this?

193
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,903
Yeah, man. All right, man.

194
00:16:11,703 --> 00:16:13,704
To money and women.

195
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:14,908
That we don't have.

196
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:20,744
How do you remember
everybody's order like that?

197
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:23,346
I can't remember
the last four of my social.

198
00:16:23,348 --> 00:16:25,215
Lots of reps man.

199
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:27,718
I'm in complete control of my environment.
People don't even know.

200
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,389
- Hey, man, time to go.
- Okay.

201
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:32,559
Wrap it up.

202
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:36,093
- Just a little bit.
- Yeah, yeah.

203
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,499
- Ziggy's going to kill me.
- Shit, not going to finish.

204
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,569
A gift.

205
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:43,500
How about a tip?

206
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,234
We got you last time.

207
00:16:45,236 --> 00:16:46,737
Oh, yeah, you got me last...

208
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,174
That's not how it works.

209
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:54,781
Okay, really? Zoo animals.

210
00:17:00,251 --> 00:17:01,521
Need change?

211
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,257
That's for you, <i>Fräulein.</i>

212
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:07,560
Thanks.

213
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:11,761
Are there always
so many cops in here?

214
00:17:11,763 --> 00:17:14,131
Last place
I'd think they'd be.

215
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:17,200
Yeah, this their spot.
You know, cheap liquor.

216
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,135
Right.

217
00:17:19,137 --> 00:17:22,141
Yeah, there also is a lot of
shady cats in here, huh?

218
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:27,444
Yeah, it's kind of neutral
grounds, you know?

219
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:29,782
Rick's in <i>Casablanca</i>
type shit.

220
00:17:31,783 --> 00:17:34,486
You must've heard
some stories in this place.

221
00:17:34,488 --> 00:17:37,954
You know, give him a couple of
drinks, steak on his plate,

222
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:39,722
some nice women around him,

223
00:17:39,724 --> 00:17:41,428
he'll tell you
his darkest secrets.

224
00:17:42,627 --> 00:17:44,129
Loose lips sink ships.

225
00:17:44,829 --> 00:17:46,299
Ain't that the truth.

226
00:17:47,165 --> 00:17:49,403
Mmm, what about you?

227
00:17:51,636 --> 00:17:54,605
Pull a lot of pussy
in here? Yeah?

228
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:55,672
Come on.

229
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:57,478
- I do well for myself.
- Yeah.

230
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,779
I'd fuck you.

231
00:18:02,647 --> 00:18:03,916
Kidding.

232
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,255
All right.

233
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:13,760
I'm out.

234
00:18:17,195 --> 00:18:18,996
See you later, man.

235
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:20,366
Yeah.

236
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,169
Look forward to it.

237
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:52,866
- <i>Fräulein.</i>
- Dude, what the fuck are you...

238
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:13,182
What the fuck?

239
00:19:32,904 --> 00:19:34,238
What's up, gangster?

240
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,338
Oh, Peaches.

241
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,710
Oh, <i>Fräulein,</i> you're up.

242
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:42,080
Sit down.
You sit right there.

243
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:47,084
What you walking
so slow for, nigga?

244
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:49,589
I want you to sit right there.
That's you right there.

245
00:19:52,459 --> 00:19:54,294
- Look here. There's cigarettes.
- Yeah.

246
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:58,596
Borracho!

247
00:19:58,598 --> 00:20:00,767
I think y'all got me
confused with somebody.

248
00:20:07,205 --> 00:20:08,441
Why my pants wet?

249
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:13,809
Come on, man, if you and
your Uncle Tom over here

250
00:20:13,811 --> 00:20:15,912
are into some
homo shit, I'm good.

251
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:17,250
Y'all just kill me now.

252
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:19,587
You pissed yourself, bubba.

253
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:22,619
It happens.

254
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:25,956
I had one of the girls here
clean you up, so you're good.

255
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,291
But y'all got the wrong dude.

256
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:30,626
You got me confused
with someone.

257
00:20:30,628 --> 00:20:33,130
But I'm going to let you know
now, I ain't the one.

258
00:20:33,132 --> 00:20:34,797
What'd you say?

259
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,633
Dude something?

260
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:39,638
No, we're not mistaking you for anybody.
Don't be a fucking smartass.

261
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:43,806
Arrested at 17 for GTA.

262
00:20:43,808 --> 00:20:46,276
Tried and convicted
as an adult.

263
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:47,643
We know exactly who you are.

264
00:20:47,645 --> 00:20:49,779
Did a stint at county
for attempted manslaughter.

265
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:52,749
Fastest speeding ticket
in California history.

266
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:53,916
That's nice.

267
00:20:53,918 --> 00:20:55,988
Fucking genius, man.
How fast were you going?

268
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:00,757
178.

269
00:21:02,126 --> 00:21:03,863
Speed demon!

270
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:08,164
What did you say to the cop
who pulled you over?

271
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,167
What reason did you give him?

272
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:13,202
Told him they'd
just paved the road.

273
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:15,939
- I like him.
- Ballsy.

274
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,341
<i>Me gusta.</i>

275
00:21:17,343 --> 00:21:19,544
You may have a little pecker
for a black dude.

276
00:21:19,546 --> 00:21:23,513
You may be a bed-wetter, but you've
got some fucking style, buddy.

277
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:27,551
All right, girls, time to go.

278
00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:29,885
Grab your shoes. Grab your shit.
Let's go.

279
00:21:29,887 --> 00:21:31,220
Time to go home
to your babies.

280
00:21:31,222 --> 00:21:32,692
- All right, thanks for stopping by.
- Excuse me.

281
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:44,300
You check this out, hot rod.
You're a two-striker.

282
00:21:44,302 --> 00:21:46,902
You need to fucking look at me
when I'm talking to you.

283
00:21:46,904 --> 00:21:51,541
You're one mistake away from getting
sex in the ass every time you shower.

284
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:55,045
Some of them niggas
got gas pumps.

285
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:59,915
Now, personally, that shit don't
sound like a lot of fun to me.

286
00:21:59,917 --> 00:22:01,887
What you think?
How you feel about that?

287
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:07,324
Look, the dude in that picture
is not even a regular at my bar.

288
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:11,995
Like, I've seen him a few times, but,
you know, I don't associate myself...

289
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:20,073
Do you know what this means?

290
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:24,442
It means I am
a member of a clique.

291
00:22:24,444 --> 00:22:26,443
It's kind of like
being in a gang.

292
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:30,079
Sort of like a gang,
only we have badges,

293
00:22:30,081 --> 00:22:32,951
which means you are done.

294
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:35,455
He ain't lying.

295
00:22:40,925 --> 00:22:42,426
Let me ask you this.

296
00:22:42,428 --> 00:22:45,629
Okay, do we look like the
types who will arrest you?

297
00:22:45,631 --> 00:22:48,735
Put you in handcuffs,
drag you down to the station?

298
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:51,233
Hmm?

299
00:22:51,235 --> 00:22:52,935
I'm asking you
a fucking question.

300
00:22:52,937 --> 00:22:54,970
No. Not at all.

301
00:22:54,972 --> 00:22:57,575
Right, exactly.

302
00:22:57,577 --> 00:23:00,947
We just shoot you.
It's less paperwork.

303
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:04,585
So tell me,

304
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:10,089
what the fuck are you doing
hanging out in that crew?

305
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,590
You're a pussy.

306
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:15,791
Those dudes are bad dudes.

307
00:23:15,793 --> 00:23:19,895
Great thieves
but straight convicts.

308
00:23:19,897 --> 00:23:22,798
What's Merrimen doing drinking
beers with the likes of you for?

309
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,967
Talk shop?

310
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:25,935
You gonna hit
the fucking Hofbrau?

311
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:29,005
Take the place down, score, like,
what, two grand in ones and fives?

312
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:30,441
Is that what's afoot?
I'll answer that for you.

313
00:23:30,443 --> 00:23:32,111
No, it fucking isn't.

314
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:36,513
I don't know what crew
you're speaking about, man.

315
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:38,482
This dude just comes to
my bar where I work...

316
00:23:38,484 --> 00:23:41,788
Stop. Shut up.

317
00:23:48,793 --> 00:23:50,528
Come on, man. This is
some weird shit. Just...

318
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:53,431
You listen to me, fuckface.

319
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:55,164
We don't give
a shit about you.

320
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,503
You in Merrimen's crew?

321
00:23:59,505 --> 00:24:00,607
Hmm?

322
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:03,806
Huh? You hit the stadium?

323
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:07,309
You talky-talky now?

324
00:24:07,311 --> 00:24:08,680
Yes, please.

325
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:15,888
Fuck!

326
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:25,327
I'm just the driver!

327
00:24:25,329 --> 00:24:27,897
I'm just the driver!

328
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:30,700
They don't give me no gun.
I don't do no gangster shit.

329
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:33,068
They asked me to drive,
so that's what I do.

330
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:35,672
That's it. Fuck!

331
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:38,576
Why did Merrimen hijack
an empty armored car?

332
00:24:38,578 --> 00:24:40,210
I don't know, all right?

333
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:42,077
They keep me in the dark
for shit like this.

334
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:43,345
If the cops come down on me,

335
00:24:43,347 --> 00:24:45,382
I can't tell them shit
if I don't know shit.

336
00:24:45,385 --> 00:24:47,683
Now y'all can hook me up
to a lie detector,

337
00:24:47,685 --> 00:24:49,920
a fucking polygraph,
whatever y'all got.

338
00:24:49,922 --> 00:24:52,989
I'm telling you what I know,
and that's all you'll get.

339
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,894
Please, just let me
the fuck go.

340
00:24:57,061 --> 00:25:00,232
Fuck y'all, man.
Let me go.

341
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:05,235
Well, I thought that was
relatively convincing, hmm?

342
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:06,440
Good stuff.

343
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:09,575
All right,
when did you meet him?

344
00:25:10,577 --> 00:25:12,208
What do I get out of this?

345
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:16,249
What do you get out of this?
Well, your freedom for one.

346
00:25:17,584 --> 00:25:18,951
Two,

347
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:22,922
you're not the bad guys.

348
00:25:23,754 --> 00:25:24,924
We are.

349
00:25:30,463 --> 00:25:33,729
Couple months ago,
they came through the bar,

350
00:25:33,731 --> 00:25:36,098
<i>and I served them
a few drinks.</i>

351
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,767
<i>We started talking.</i>

352
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:39,604
This is my boy, Bosco.

353
00:25:39,606 --> 00:25:42,074
My brother for life.
We deployed together.

354
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:45,243
Hey, the kid can drive.

355
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:48,613
Okay.

356
00:25:48,615 --> 00:25:51,615
Donnie, tell him about
the Trans Am Series.

357
00:25:51,617 --> 00:25:54,787
Drove Trans Am Series, like
he said, for about a season.

358
00:25:55,488 --> 00:25:56,956
What were their names?

359
00:25:58,089 --> 00:25:59,791
Hawaiian dude,

360
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:02,995
he had a homie,
Bosco, white boy.

361
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:08,230
He was in the military,
and he worked for DWP.

362
00:26:08,232 --> 00:26:10,269
I told him I needed
some extra money,

363
00:26:11,168 --> 00:26:13,135
so he gave me a job.

364
00:26:13,137 --> 00:26:15,474
Who's that? Merrimen?

365
00:26:16,642 --> 00:26:18,110
Merrimen.

366
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,977
<i>Ray Merrimen.</i>

367
00:26:28,819 --> 00:26:30,621
So what's up with this dude?

368
00:26:30,623 --> 00:26:31,856
It's Marcus' boy.

369
00:26:34,291 --> 00:26:36,825
Worked with him
over at the Hofbrau.

370
00:26:36,827 --> 00:26:39,462
Say he did some time
with him at Wayside.

371
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:40,665
He was a Marine for a minute.

372
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:45,804
Say the nigga can drive.
He be cool.

373
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:50,876
All right,
let's check him out.

374
00:26:52,109 --> 00:26:54,511
<i>Real smart dude.</i>

375
00:26:54,513 --> 00:26:56,848
<i>He had just got out of prison
from what I could tell.</i>

376
00:27:03,187 --> 00:27:04,523
You ready to roll, Ray?

377
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,192
514!

378
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:14,900
Come on, let's cuff them up.

379
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:34,386
See you soon, Ray.

380
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:41,891
No, you won't.

381
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:43,527
<i>Where'd you meet him?</i>

382
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:46,261
<i>It was in Carson,
at the Hawaiian dude's house.</i>

383
00:27:49,402 --> 00:27:51,568
- Donnie, what's good, man?
- What's up?

384
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,338
- Come on, man. Follow me.
- Yeah, yeah.

385
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,242
Hey.

386
00:27:58,411 --> 00:28:00,577
Oh, shit. What's up?

387
00:28:00,579 --> 00:28:02,581
- Donnie, beer?
- Yeah, yeah.

388
00:28:03,714 --> 00:28:04,750
Thank you. Thank you.

389
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:15,627
So you spent
some time at Wayside?

390
00:28:16,293 --> 00:28:17,729
Yeah, a little bit.

391
00:28:19,432 --> 00:28:21,601
What do they serve
for breakfast on Fridays?

392
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:29,104
Silver dollar pancakes.

393
00:28:29,106 --> 00:28:30,276
Three of them.

394
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:33,446
Where you from?

395
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:34,980
Hawthorne.

396
00:28:36,947 --> 00:28:38,484
So you can drive, huh?

397
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:41,618
Oh, I can drive.

398
00:28:47,925 --> 00:28:49,659
Drive.

399
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:51,630
You might want to
put that seat belt on.

400
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,256
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

401
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:39,008
He liked how I drove, so, a
week later, I did my first gig.

402
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:41,012
<i>We hit this rave at a stadium.</i>

403
00:30:11,076 --> 00:30:12,344
Got one.

404
00:30:33,432 --> 00:30:35,934
Minus the dye pack,
is the count all good?

405
00:30:38,537 --> 00:30:40,072
The count is on.

406
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:48,076
That's a lot of money
right there, bro.

407
00:30:48,078 --> 00:30:50,078
Why don't we
just call it a day?

408
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,948
Really?

409
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:54,383
You want three in hot bills,

410
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:57,421
you looking over your shoulder
for the rest of your life,

411
00:30:57,423 --> 00:30:59,459
or would you rather
have 30 clean?

412
00:31:00,626 --> 00:31:02,060
I'm just saying.

413
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:05,798
Let's just call it quits
while we're ahead.

414
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:09,603
Put it away.

415
00:31:10,603 --> 00:31:11,904
We're trading up.

416
00:31:15,307 --> 00:31:18,277
All right. Fuck it.
Let's do it.

417
00:31:19,578 --> 00:31:21,310
What happened to the cash?

418
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:22,647
I don't know.

419
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,750
They don't tell me.

420
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:27,285
They don't talk much.

421
00:31:29,788 --> 00:31:32,790
Yeah, people with things to
hide never have much to say.

422
00:31:35,594 --> 00:31:38,998
So am I under arrest,
or can I leave?

423
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:44,401
Nah, you just keep
doing your thing.

424
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:45,671
We'll be in touch.

425
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:05,121
Yeah?

426
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:08,294
<i>Horsepower, be at 1st and
Central at 0800. Don't be late.</i>

427
00:33:42,421 --> 00:33:43,423
Jesus Christ!

428
00:33:44,955 --> 00:33:47,792
You scared the shit out of me,
babe. Can't do that.

429
00:33:48,627 --> 00:33:50,295
What are you doing right now?

430
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:57,269
You erasing your recent calls?

431
00:34:00,473 --> 00:34:03,271
My phone? What do you mean?

432
00:34:03,273 --> 00:34:06,108
I don't know how to work this
fucking thing. You know that.

433
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,445
"I don't know how to work this
fucking thing. You know that."

434
00:34:08,447 --> 00:34:09,615
Come on.

435
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:14,617
Babe, we really have
to go through this right now?

436
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:15,653
Where you been?

437
00:34:18,957 --> 00:34:21,292
It's 6:00 a.m.
Where have you been?

438
00:34:22,494 --> 00:34:24,259
Been at work?

439
00:34:24,261 --> 00:34:28,131
Surveillance? Robbing drug dealers?
Because you smell like a stripper.

440
00:34:28,133 --> 00:34:29,635
Of course, I was at work.

441
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:35,941
It's funny
'cause I got this text.

442
00:34:38,444 --> 00:34:39,812
What was so hot, then?

443
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:41,847
Is that a work text?

444
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:43,749
Huh?

445
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:50,819
You fucked up.
You text me instead.

446
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:54,993
Who does that?

447
00:35:00,999 --> 00:35:04,167
It's street theater, babe.
It's not what it looks like.

448
00:35:04,169 --> 00:35:05,203
I'm sorry.

449
00:35:06,136 --> 00:35:07,339
Me, too.

450
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:21,153
Fuck.

451
00:35:23,053 --> 00:35:24,554
We're going
to go to Auntie's house

452
00:35:24,556 --> 00:35:26,955
because Daddy's got to do
a little work on the house.

453
00:35:26,957 --> 00:35:28,390
And we have
something else to do.

454
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:29,694
- Come on.
- What the fuck?

455
00:35:30,662 --> 00:35:32,328
Hey, yo.

456
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,196
It's gonna be too loud
for you guys, okay?

457
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:36,532
- Deb? Deb?
- Will you put this on?

458
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:37,899
- Is Daddy coming with us?
- What are you doing, Deb?

459
00:35:37,901 --> 00:35:40,169
What the fuck are you doing?

460
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:41,671
- It will be too loud for you guys.
- Wifey, wifey.

461
00:35:41,673 --> 00:35:43,207
Seriously,
what are you doing?

462
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:45,674
Is Daddy coming with us?

463
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:47,476
No, Daddy does not have
enough time for us right now.

464
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,879
- Seriously... That's nice. That's nice.
- Can you put this on here?

465
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:51,913
Hey, honey.
Mommy didn't mean that, okay?

466
00:35:51,915 --> 00:35:54,884
Hey, sweetie, come here.
Mommy didn't mean that, okay?

467
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:58,190
She didn't mean that, okay?
Sweetie, you okay?

468
00:35:59,592 --> 00:36:00,922
Yeah, great. Great.

469
00:36:00,924 --> 00:36:03,225
Hey. Come here, honey.

470
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:04,727
I'm not going to be able
to make it right now,

471
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:06,895
but I'm gonna come
a little later, okay?

472
00:36:06,897 --> 00:36:08,397
All right. Come here.
Give me a hug.

473
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:10,332
- Time to go right now.
- Christ sake.

474
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:11,901
Will you slow it down
a second?

475
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:13,268
Give Daddy some rest.
He's real tired.

476
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:14,904
- Right, hon?
- What...

477
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:18,110
Deb. Deb. Deb, will you
slow it down a second?

478
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:20,743
- We're going to walk this way...
- Deb.

479
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:23,011
Okay, watch your step.
Here we go.

480
00:36:23,013 --> 00:36:24,414
Deb, can you slow it...

481
00:36:24,416 --> 00:36:26,781
Okay. Come on.

482
00:36:26,783 --> 00:36:28,552
Let's go. We're going to
put your sister in first.

483
00:36:28,554 --> 00:36:30,886
Here we go. Okay, baby, ready?

484
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:32,888
Sweetie, it's going to be
okay, sweetie. Okay?

485
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,756
Let's go.

486
00:36:34,758 --> 00:36:37,892
Okay, put your bags in there. You
wanna put your sister in the seat?

487
00:36:37,894 --> 00:36:38,963
Where's the pink bag?

488
00:36:40,098 --> 00:36:42,230
Have you lost
your fucking mind?

489
00:36:42,232 --> 00:36:44,299
Oh, great language right
in front of my daughter.

490
00:36:44,301 --> 00:36:45,734
Great fathering!

491
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:47,603
Nice. Nice. Dropping F-bombs
in front of my daughters.

492
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:50,574
- "My kids," huh? "My kids?"
- Great fathering!

493
00:36:50,576 --> 00:36:53,612
Gonna find a guy whose cock
actually gets hard for me.

494
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:56,748
Deb, Deb, Deb. Stop!

495
00:36:57,649 --> 00:36:58,951
Please don't do this.

496
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:02,321
Please.

497
00:37:14,932 --> 00:37:18,267
This is a little hard. You're just
scared right now, okay? You're confused.

498
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:19,270
Okay...

499
00:37:22,339 --> 00:37:24,175
Out of the way, Nick.
Get out of the way, Nick.

500
00:37:26,343 --> 00:37:28,643
Get the fuck
out of here, you fucker!

501
00:37:28,645 --> 00:37:30,245
You motherfucker!

502
00:37:30,247 --> 00:37:34,350
You get back! You understand
me, you motherfucker?

503
00:37:35,487 --> 00:37:36,821
- Stay away from us!
- Nice. Nice.

504
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:38,790
Good. Good.

505
00:37:46,029 --> 00:37:47,999
Okay. Mommy's okay.

506
00:37:57,374 --> 00:37:58,676
See you later.

507
00:38:04,848 --> 00:38:06,318
Perfect.

508
00:38:09,821 --> 00:38:11,189
Morning.

509
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:33,676
Ran the prints on CAL-ID.

510
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:36,078
Got a hit on our
dead guy from Angel City.

511
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:39,681
- Check your e-mail.
- All right.

512
00:38:39,683 --> 00:38:42,752
Name's Marcus Rhodes,
from Oakland.

513
00:38:42,754 --> 00:38:45,687
ATF was looking for him
for gun charges.

514
00:38:45,689 --> 00:38:47,890
And more to the point
that you were making before,

515
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:51,660
he was stationed at Twentynine Palms
the same time Merrimen was there.

516
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,365
This is good.
Give me the book on Merrimen.

517
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,537
Look to your right.

518
00:38:59,505 --> 00:39:01,069
You know what that is?

519
00:39:01,071 --> 00:39:03,606
It's the bank for banks.

520
00:39:03,608 --> 00:39:07,076
Los Angeles branch
of the Federal Reserve.

521
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:09,214
It's the only bank
that's never been robbed.

522
00:39:16,953 --> 00:39:19,556
All the surrounding streets
are wired for sound and image.

523
00:39:19,558 --> 00:39:22,559
Stand across the street and stare
at the building for two minutes,

524
00:39:22,561 --> 00:39:25,361
you'll have security on your ass
asking you politely to leave.

525
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,263
If they see your face again,

526
00:39:27,265 --> 00:39:30,434
every Secret Service agent in the
country is going to be looking for you.

527
00:39:30,436 --> 00:39:31,437
The place is case-proof.

528
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:38,073
There have been
53 break-in attempts.

529
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:39,877
Not one has
got past the lobby.

530
00:39:43,281 --> 00:39:44,916
That's why
we're going to rob it.

531
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:48,216
Okay, here we go.

532
00:39:48,218 --> 00:39:50,487
Laguna Niguel was in '06.

533
00:39:50,489 --> 00:39:54,089
Got caught for that, get sent
up to USP Victorville SHU

534
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:56,959
until June of '16.
Now give me the unsolved book.

535
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:58,993
<i>As soon as
you enter the lobby,</i>

536
00:39:58,995 --> 00:40:01,597
<i>computers run you through every law
enforcement database in the country.</i>

537
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,765
If you've got outstanding
parking tickets,

538
00:40:03,767 --> 00:40:06,634
they're going to know about it before you
get through the first level of security.

539
00:40:06,636 --> 00:40:09,071
All the employees wear
security swipe cards

540
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,306
that grant them access through
the first set of man-traps.

541
00:40:11,308 --> 00:40:14,310
<i>Access is severely restricted.</i>

542
00:40:14,312 --> 00:40:16,579
<i>Two stories below street level
is the vault floor.</i>

543
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:17,783
By the way,

544
00:40:18,483 --> 00:40:20,483
uh, his crimey...

545
00:40:20,485 --> 00:40:21,587
- Levoux?
- Levoux.

546
00:40:22,252 --> 00:40:24,185
He serve with Merrimen?

547
00:40:24,187 --> 00:40:27,456
Not only that, but they played football
in high school at Long Beach Poly.

548
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:29,859
- You've got to be shitting me.
- No.

549
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:33,429
<i>Central Security, it's
the nerve center for the Fed.</i>

550
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:37,332
<i>This is where the armored cars
come in, drop off the money tubs.</i>

551
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:39,536
<i>Money tubs are handed off
to the Fed employees.</i>

552
00:40:39,538 --> 00:40:45,140
<i>At any one time, there's anywhere between
500 and 800 billion dollars in there,</i>

553
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:48,776
<i>every millimeter of it covered by
cameras, sensors, and motion detectors.</i>

554
00:40:48,778 --> 00:40:50,480
Yeah. What did they
specialize in?

555
00:40:50,482 --> 00:40:54,116
I got this from the HR desk
at Twentynine Palms.

556
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:57,720
Close Quarter Battle Unit. Both
saw combat in the Middle East.

557
00:40:57,722 --> 00:41:02,156
Levoux specializes in explosives, where
Merrimen specializes in soldiering,

558
00:41:02,158 --> 00:41:05,026
both MARSOC fast Marines.

559
00:41:05,028 --> 00:41:06,861
But there's a hitch.

560
00:41:06,863 --> 00:41:10,165
The serial number of every bill is
recorded in the Fed's database.

561
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:11,568
<i>So, if a note goes missing,</i>

562
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:13,067
<i>they're going to know
exactly which one it is.</i>

563
00:41:13,069 --> 00:41:15,803
They're going to flag it.
If that bill comes up again,

564
00:41:15,805 --> 00:41:18,806
whoever recirculates that cash, no
matter where they are in the world,

565
00:41:18,808 --> 00:41:20,042
that person can be tracked.

566
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:22,343
Okay. Bosco,
the peckerwood?

567
00:41:22,345 --> 00:41:25,514
He's a Huntington Beach kid,
also MARSOC Marines.

568
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:28,216
He did comms with them.
He had a solid career.

569
00:41:28,218 --> 00:41:30,352
But he didn't serve together
with the other guys.

570
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:32,988
He was the Wood Rep at Victorville
when Merrimen was there.

571
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,989
That's where they linked up.

572
00:41:34,991 --> 00:41:38,727
Donnie was a Marine for a
year and a half, then discharged.

573
00:41:38,729 --> 00:41:40,429
So, the way I see it,

574
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:42,196
that's the way all these niggas
ended up working together.

575
00:41:42,198 --> 00:41:45,434
There's only two passports on the
streets, sports and military.

576
00:41:45,436 --> 00:41:48,203
Every time the Fed receives
a deposit from a bank,

577
00:41:48,205 --> 00:41:51,105
<i>first thing they do is send that
money up to the count rooms.</i>

578
00:41:51,107 --> 00:41:53,443
<i>They run the notes
through the counting machines.</i>

579
00:41:53,445 --> 00:41:55,209
<i>They're accomplishing
two things here.</i>

580
00:41:55,211 --> 00:41:57,779
<i>First, they're double-checking the
accuracy of the bank's deposit.</i>

581
00:41:57,781 --> 00:41:59,348
<i>If the bank is off at all,</i>

582
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,183
they're going to credit or
debit the account accordingly.

583
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:06,921
Two, they're separating newer, fit
currency from old unfit bills.

584
00:42:06,923 --> 00:42:09,559
But most importantly, they're
erasing the serial numbers

585
00:42:09,561 --> 00:42:11,859
of the old bills
from the Fed system.

586
00:42:11,861 --> 00:42:15,763
Once those numbers are erased, to
the Fed, to the rest of the world,

587
00:42:15,765 --> 00:42:18,067
that money
has ceased to exist.

588
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:19,634
Wait, let's look at
the unsolved cases.

589
00:42:19,636 --> 00:42:24,038
In '04, you have the Boller
National Bank Hollywood job, okay?

590
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,741
They tunneled through
the sewer system.

591
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:29,812
Sophisticated, skill set,
someone with access, unsolved.

592
00:42:29,814 --> 00:42:33,483
Okay, in '05, you have the
Fuerte armored car depot job.

593
00:42:33,485 --> 00:42:35,585
Blew the depot vault
with shaped charges.

594
00:42:35,587 --> 00:42:37,554
In the $100 count room alone,

595
00:42:37,556 --> 00:42:42,223
an average of $30 million is
designated as unfit every day.

596
00:42:42,225 --> 00:42:43,725
Between 4:00 p.m.
and 5:00 p.m.,

597
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:46,063
<i>all the cash gets shot out
to the shredder.</i>

598
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:47,933
It's all destroyed.

599
00:42:49,299 --> 00:42:55,169
$30 million
turned to dust in seconds.

600
00:42:55,171 --> 00:42:57,474
It's then picked up by the
Fed's waste management company

601
00:42:57,476 --> 00:42:58,843
and brought out to the dump.

602
00:43:00,512 --> 00:43:02,512
If we can get to
those unfit bills

603
00:43:02,514 --> 00:43:05,814
before they go to the shredders
and get out clean...

604
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:08,585
You got $30 million
nobody is looking for.

605
00:43:08,587 --> 00:43:09,785
Bingo.

606
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:12,154
In '06,
you have Laguna Niguel.

607
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:15,823
Same thing, only this time Merrimen
gets unlucky with the tail-light.

608
00:43:15,825 --> 00:43:20,828
Goes to prison till 2016. Now in
that time, while he was in prison,

609
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:23,931
how many highly sophisticated,
well-executed heists do we have?

610
00:43:23,933 --> 00:43:25,667
None, but you're
on a roll. Keep going.

611
00:43:25,669 --> 00:43:29,606
The counter guy at the donut shop?
Witness to the whole thing.

612
00:43:29,608 --> 00:43:30,675
They left him. Why?

613
00:43:33,545 --> 00:43:37,145
Because they shoot uniforms,
not unarmed civilians.

614
00:43:37,147 --> 00:43:38,883
Exactly what
they were trained to do.

615
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:41,453
Gangbangers, these are not.

616
00:43:42,386 --> 00:43:46,888
Okay, these are our guys.

617
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:50,861
We nail these guys,
we solve all these cases.

618
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,832
This is the crew.

619
00:43:55,865 --> 00:43:58,570
You still haven't told us how
you can get past that security.

620
00:44:00,071 --> 00:44:01,873
We're not going in this way.

621
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:06,077
We're going in that way.

622
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:17,852
What's going on
with <i>Fräulein?</i>

623
00:44:17,854 --> 00:44:19,757
We can move on him
anytime we want.

624
00:44:21,758 --> 00:44:23,692
- I pay minimum wage.
- Okay.

625
00:44:23,694 --> 00:44:27,062
Plus $3 for delivery.
And you split the tip with me.

626
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:29,198
You start Wednesday, 11:00.

627
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,933
Thank you.

628
00:44:30,935 --> 00:44:32,901
I don't really like the
food there, but I'm down to go,

629
00:44:32,903 --> 00:44:35,002
- but you've got to pay this time.
- I'm not paying it.

630
00:44:35,004 --> 00:44:36,438
What?

631
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,107
- I pay every fucking time.
- What?

632
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:40,443
Get off your wallet, buddy.

633
00:44:40,445 --> 00:44:42,111
No, I forgot my wallet today,
boys. I'm sorry.

634
00:44:42,113 --> 00:44:43,879
- Again?
- Yeah, again.

635
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:45,180
Got an alligator arm.

636
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:48,550
I sat down at blackjack
with $5, and I made $160.

637
00:44:48,552 --> 00:44:50,187
Nicholas O'Brien?

638
00:44:51,756 --> 00:44:53,221
Yeah?

639
00:44:53,223 --> 00:44:55,225
I suggest you take these.

640
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:57,795
You're being served.

641
00:44:58,928 --> 00:45:00,261
You kidding me?

642
00:45:00,263 --> 00:45:01,599
I'm afraid not.

643
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:04,903
What's going on?

644
00:45:06,035 --> 00:45:08,102
You all right, bro?

645
00:45:08,104 --> 00:45:09,574
Yeah, I guess
I'm getting divorced.

646
00:45:10,774 --> 00:45:12,209
He say "divorced"?

647
00:45:13,977 --> 00:45:15,245
Yo.

648
00:45:16,946 --> 00:45:18,946
Welcome to the fucking club.

649
00:45:18,948 --> 00:45:20,784
Now, go handle your business,
big man.

650
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:41,837
There's a closer view.

651
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:44,507
There was a rolling blackout in
this quadrant four days ago.

652
00:45:44,509 --> 00:45:46,442
Yeah, they've been happening a
lot over the last few months.

653
00:45:46,444 --> 00:45:48,142
Okay.

654
00:45:48,144 --> 00:45:50,579
They say they have full backup
power, but actually they don't.

655
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:53,781
- They go into brown-out.
- Yeah, prioritize the grid.

656
00:45:53,783 --> 00:45:56,819
Priority, of course, is the vault.
So everything in there stays intact.

657
00:45:56,821 --> 00:45:59,489
But anything that is peripheral,
like cameras in the hallway,

658
00:45:59,491 --> 00:46:02,658
shredders in the count rooms,
everything else cuts out.

659
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:06,194
To time it during another rolling blackout
is going to be fucking impossible.

660
00:46:06,196 --> 00:46:08,997
- So you want to simulate it?
- Can we?

661
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:11,033
Break in, have them go brown
for about two minutes.

662
00:46:11,035 --> 00:46:14,203
I'd say yes, but I'd like
to have data to be sure.

663
00:46:14,205 --> 00:46:15,770
Great.

664
00:46:15,772 --> 00:46:18,172
Once we breach the count room,
only thing left is the cameras.

665
00:46:18,174 --> 00:46:20,008
They run on their
own power supply,

666
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:22,612
so they're unaffected
by the brown-out.

667
00:46:22,614 --> 00:46:26,214
The solve here is
we run an EMP burst.

668
00:46:26,216 --> 00:46:29,651
Should take out the cameras
and motion for about 30 feet.

669
00:46:29,653 --> 00:46:31,689
Where you get all this
information from?

670
00:46:33,525 --> 00:46:35,691
You don't have to
worry about that.

671
00:46:35,693 --> 00:46:37,395
Just trust me
when I say it's solid.

672
00:46:39,062 --> 00:46:40,863
How we doing
with the Telecal hook?

673
00:46:40,865 --> 00:46:43,234
Couple days.
Shouldn't be a problem.

674
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:46,904
<i>How many handlers do you need?</i>

675
00:46:53,176 --> 00:46:54,547
<i>Uh, gate B right now.</i>

676
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:59,384
Strolling right into
the Federal Reserve.

677
00:47:05,421 --> 00:47:07,357
<i>Force leaving loading dock B.</i>

678
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:21,272
ID?

679
00:47:29,514 --> 00:47:30,715
Sign in, please.

680
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:42,790
Keep this on you
at all times.

681
00:47:42,792 --> 00:47:45,563
Second bay of elevators.
Cafeteria's level 2.

682
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:50,569
Buzz him in. He's good.

683
00:47:52,102 --> 00:47:53,606
Smells good.

684
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:56,274
He's good. Let him in.

685
00:48:15,926 --> 00:48:18,627
- Sharon?
- Mmm-hmm. That's me.

686
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:21,129
- How you all doing?
- Good. How you are doing today?

687
00:48:21,131 --> 00:48:23,569
- He's fine.
- Thank you.

688
00:48:24,301 --> 00:48:25,767
She ain't getting none.

689
00:48:25,769 --> 00:48:28,169
Shut up. Really?

690
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:30,505
Y'all have a good day.
I'm gonna stay out of it.

691
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:32,774
- We will now.
- You have a wonderful day.

692
00:48:32,776 --> 00:48:36,143
Lunch. Dessert.
Lunch. Dessert.

693
00:48:36,145 --> 00:48:37,147
Bye, sunshine.

694
00:49:09,447 --> 00:49:10,549
There he goes.

695
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:23,995
My gosh.

696
00:49:24,861 --> 00:49:26,196
Aw!

697
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:36,841
- Oh, he's here.
- Okay.

698
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:47,915
Damn, girl looking fine.

699
00:49:47,917 --> 00:49:50,419
Thank you.
You look amazing.

700
00:49:50,421 --> 00:49:52,554
How are you?

701
00:49:52,556 --> 00:49:54,388
- Looking good.
- Thank you.

702
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:56,424
- This is my mom. This is Rolando.
- Hi.

703
00:49:56,426 --> 00:49:58,993
- Nice to meet you. Rolando.
- Hi, I'm Malia. Nice to meet you.

704
00:49:58,995 --> 00:50:01,395
- I see where you get your looks from.
- Thank you.

705
00:50:03,901 --> 00:50:05,100
Thank you.

706
00:50:05,102 --> 00:50:06,937
- Can I take that?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

707
00:50:08,572 --> 00:50:11,272
Um, Rolando,
this is my dad.

708
00:50:11,274 --> 00:50:14,579
What's up, Mr. Levoux?
Nice to meet you.

709
00:50:17,414 --> 00:50:19,783
Let me holler at him
for a second.

710
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:23,454
Let me talk to you, bruh.

711
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:34,599
Honey, don't worry about it.
Okay? They're just gonna talk.

712
00:50:42,738 --> 00:50:44,406
So here's what's up.

713
00:50:44,408 --> 00:50:46,374
For the past 16 years,

714
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:49,044
my daughter's safety and protection
has been my responsibility

715
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:51,245
and my responsibility only.

716
00:50:51,247 --> 00:50:55,453
Now, for the first time in her life, I see
I've got to hand you that responsibility.

717
00:50:56,587 --> 00:50:57,919
Don't fuck up,

718
00:50:57,921 --> 00:50:59,621
or your mama
will weep as she has

719
00:50:59,623 --> 00:51:02,560
to wheel your ass around every
day the rest of your life.

720
00:51:05,328 --> 00:51:09,296
Now I worked on this, because I want to
say this to you as nice as possible.

721
00:51:09,298 --> 00:51:10,799
Do you understand?

722
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:13,134
Yeah. Yes, sir.

723
00:51:18,476 --> 00:51:20,442
It's all right.
It's all right.

724
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:22,310
Listen. Listen.

725
00:51:22,312 --> 00:51:24,913
All he's trying to say is,
it's wonderful to meet you,

726
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,984
and he wants you
to have a beautiful evening.

727
00:51:28,685 --> 00:51:30,254
I'll see you at 11:30.

728
00:51:30,988 --> 00:51:32,487
Yeah. Yeah.

729
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:35,258
- 11:30. Yeah. 11:30.
- Good choice.

730
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:44,668
I think he got
the picture, bro.

731
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:50,841
Psst.

732
00:52:23,372 --> 00:52:25,140
Beers and sake,
let's go.

733
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:27,579
- Have wine.
- What the fuck?

734
00:53:01,711 --> 00:53:02,712
Hey.

735
00:53:03,714 --> 00:53:04,749
Buddy.

736
00:53:06,682 --> 00:53:08,015
Donnie, right?

737
00:53:08,017 --> 00:53:09,917
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

738
00:53:09,919 --> 00:53:11,785
Yeah, spotted you at the gym
the other day, yeah?

739
00:53:11,787 --> 00:53:13,388
Yeah, man. How you doing?

740
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:14,959
What's up, fellows?

741
00:53:18,227 --> 00:53:19,696
You play football
at Long Beach Poly?

742
00:53:20,397 --> 00:53:21,533
You look familiar.

743
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:24,202
No, I'm not from around here.

744
00:53:27,203 --> 00:53:29,439
What are you doing here?
You work around here?

745
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:33,541
Enjoying my dinner, man.

746
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:34,908
- Really?
- Yeah.

747
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:35,912
Food here sucks.

748
00:53:37,482 --> 00:53:41,752
Yeah. Yeah,
we come here for the ass.

749
00:53:47,124 --> 00:53:48,627
So I'll see ya
at the gym, man.

750
00:53:53,229 --> 00:53:56,230
Yeah. Definitely.

751
00:53:56,232 --> 00:53:57,603
Have a good night.

752
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:08,276
Number 55, right?
That's how I remember you.

753
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:10,414
We wore the same
number, 55, right?

754
00:54:11,147 --> 00:54:12,680
I went to South Torrance.

755
00:54:12,682 --> 00:54:15,583
Yeah, we played you guys
a couple of times.

756
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:18,252
You and all those
fat-ass Samoans.

757
00:54:18,254 --> 00:54:21,656
Yeah, they were big,
but, man, lazy motherfuckers.

758
00:54:21,658 --> 00:54:23,094
Probably all that Spam.

759
00:54:24,995 --> 00:54:27,027
Yeah, we fucking
crushed you guys.

760
00:54:27,029 --> 00:54:30,033
Crushed you guys when I was there.
Crushed you guys when you were there.

761
00:54:30,834 --> 00:54:32,303
Still crushing you guys.

762
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:36,937
We've got family here, bro.

763
00:54:36,939 --> 00:54:38,606
Don't really appreciate
you popping off.

764
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:41,843
All right. All right, man.
No need to get all agro.

765
00:54:41,845 --> 00:54:44,649
Was I being rude?
Was I being rude?

766
00:54:46,048 --> 00:54:48,149
- What?
- Let's go order, bro.

767
00:54:48,151 --> 00:54:49,984
Hey, look, man, listen.

768
00:54:49,986 --> 00:54:53,492
You've got a beautiful family.
Everything's all good. Excuse us.

769
00:54:56,859 --> 00:54:58,028
<i>Kampai.</i>

770
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:00,865
See you at the gym, Donnie.

771
00:55:02,232 --> 00:55:03,634
Have a good night, ladies.

772
00:55:31,861 --> 00:55:32,930
You a cop?

773
00:55:34,698 --> 00:55:36,901
No. Are you?

774
00:55:45,709 --> 00:55:46,777
Get out of the car.

775
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:56,754
Go!

776
00:56:16,772 --> 00:56:18,038
- Where's the wire?
- Come on, man.

777
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,776
I'm not wearing
a fucking wire, man.

778
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:23,877
Man, I'm not wearing
no fucking wire.

779
00:56:28,819 --> 00:56:29,954
Get up.

780
00:56:39,463 --> 00:56:41,563
How does he know you?

781
00:56:41,565 --> 00:56:43,400
Don't tell me
it's from the fucking gym.

782
00:56:45,001 --> 00:56:46,968
Look, I don't know him.

783
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:47,972
Smoke this punk.

784
00:56:52,008 --> 00:56:54,776
Talk, motherfucker.

785
00:56:54,778 --> 00:56:56,944
I'm not no cop, all right?

786
00:56:56,946 --> 00:56:58,846
Now he came to me.
He know you.

787
00:56:58,848 --> 00:57:01,816
He know all of you.
But I ain't tell him shit.

788
00:57:01,818 --> 00:57:03,417
He was sweating me.
I ain't seen him since.

789
00:57:03,419 --> 00:57:04,988
I thought he'd leave us alone.

790
00:57:13,162 --> 00:57:14,631
So how much do they know?

791
00:57:16,467 --> 00:57:17,469
Nothing.

792
00:57:18,702 --> 00:57:20,469
I ain't tell them shit.

793
00:57:20,471 --> 00:57:23,004
I don't know nothing anyway.

794
00:57:23,006 --> 00:57:25,843
And you know I'm the last
person that would fuck this up.

795
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:30,014
Now, if we've got to
call it off, I get it.

796
00:57:31,147 --> 00:57:32,850
But I know
I ain't tell them shit.

797
00:57:56,474 --> 00:57:59,544
Friday. Make sure
he knows it's on.

798
00:58:27,037 --> 00:58:29,069
So good.

799
00:58:29,071 --> 00:58:31,908
It's true, though. It's true.

800
00:58:32,543 --> 00:58:33,944
Okay.

801
00:58:34,512 --> 00:58:35,679
Okay.

802
00:58:45,523 --> 00:58:46,955
How you doing, Nick?

803
00:58:46,957 --> 00:58:48,192
Hmm.

804
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:52,093
- I'm Nick.
- Hello.

805
00:58:52,095 --> 00:58:54,265
- How are you?
- Good.

806
00:58:58,801 --> 00:59:00,401
What's for...

807
00:59:00,403 --> 00:59:02,904
- What's for dinner?
- You smell like alcohol, Nick.

808
00:59:02,906 --> 00:59:04,108
Hmm?

809
00:59:07,776 --> 00:59:08,878
Relax.

810
00:59:09,778 --> 00:59:11,748
I already ate.

811
00:59:18,455 --> 00:59:20,455
Give me a pen, stud.

812
00:59:20,457 --> 00:59:22,625
Nick, I was gonna call you.

813
00:59:22,627 --> 00:59:24,158
I was gonna take you
to dinner next week.

814
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,163
Just give me a fucking pen.

815
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:45,516
Thanks, Rudd.

816
00:59:47,783 --> 00:59:50,521
- I'm gonna hit the...
- No, you're not.

817
00:59:57,426 --> 00:59:58,928
How's the wine?

818
01:00:01,464 --> 01:00:02,799
Good?

819
01:00:06,536 --> 01:00:08,671
That's pretty fucking good.

820
01:00:10,372 --> 01:00:12,172
So I imagine
I just, uh...

821
01:00:12,174 --> 01:00:16,013
What, just sign
anywhere, yeah?

822
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,312
Okay.

823
01:00:18,314 --> 01:00:21,883
And I imagine it's assumed
that if you were ever

824
01:00:21,885 --> 01:00:25,819
to touch one of my girls
or, say, talk to them

825
01:00:25,821 --> 01:00:27,691
or, you know,
even look at them,

826
01:00:29,158 --> 01:00:32,359
I go boom-boom. You
know what I'm saying?

827
01:00:32,361 --> 01:00:33,861
But, I mean, that's
self-evident, right?

828
01:00:33,863 --> 01:00:36,698
There's no need to put that
in the contract, is there?

829
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:38,002
- No, I didn't think so.
- Nick...

830
01:00:43,205 --> 01:00:45,509
Can you please go, Nick?

831
01:00:46,543 --> 01:00:48,678
- That's enough, Nick.
- Sure.

832
01:00:53,682 --> 01:00:54,717
Come on.

833
01:00:56,252 --> 01:00:58,720
Come here. Give me a hug.

834
01:00:58,722 --> 01:01:01,225
Come on. We'll save
a fortune in therapy.

835
01:01:04,394 --> 01:01:05,395
Hmm?

836
01:01:06,895 --> 01:01:08,031
Come on. Give me a hug.

837
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,866
There you go, huh, hoss?

838
01:01:12,868 --> 01:01:15,770
You've just always got to make
a spectacle out of everything.

839
01:01:15,772 --> 01:01:17,572
There you go.

840
01:01:17,574 --> 01:01:19,042
Yeah, pretty much.

841
01:01:20,243 --> 01:01:22,779
All right, Nick.
I think it's time to go.

842
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:25,281
Come on, Nick, let's go.

843
01:01:28,718 --> 01:01:30,917
Call the fucking cops.
That's what I'm saying.

844
01:01:30,919 --> 01:01:33,421
- Call the fucking cops.
- I'm sorry, but it's time for you to go.

845
01:01:33,423 --> 01:01:34,756
Call the cops.

846
01:01:34,758 --> 01:01:37,390
- I'm sorry...
- Don't fucking touch me.

847
01:01:37,392 --> 01:01:40,026
- I'm sorry.
- Do not fucking touch me.

848
01:01:40,028 --> 01:01:42,065
- Come on, Nick.
- Just, please go.

849
01:01:56,278 --> 01:01:57,981
Take your time.

850
01:02:05,053 --> 01:02:07,825
What happened to you?

851
01:02:15,964 --> 01:02:17,934
Borracho, what do you think?

852
01:02:19,002 --> 01:02:20,968
What the fuck was that?

853
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:22,270
You spotted me at the gym?

854
01:02:22,272 --> 01:02:23,907
<i>Tranquillo.</i> All right?

855
01:02:26,308 --> 01:02:27,977
Sit down.

856
01:02:31,314 --> 01:02:33,314
I'll take it, Freddy.

857
01:02:33,316 --> 01:02:35,587
Just give us a minute, okay?

858
01:02:38,821 --> 01:02:41,657
Look, they're not going to off
you with this much heat, okay?

859
01:02:43,325 --> 01:02:44,794
When's this happening?

860
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:46,498
Friday.

861
01:02:47,462 --> 01:02:49,263
Where?

862
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:51,468
I don't know yet.
All I can tell you is Friday.

863
01:02:52,167 --> 01:02:53,834
TGIF, huh?

864
01:02:53,836 --> 01:02:55,606
You're protecting me on this.

865
01:02:56,205 --> 01:02:57,441
<i>Fräulein,</i>

866
01:02:59,174 --> 01:03:00,310
we got your back, bro.

867
01:03:01,478 --> 01:03:03,147
Don't worry about a thing.

868
01:03:05,682 --> 01:03:06,884
Fuck.

869
01:03:09,319 --> 01:03:11,154
Better wear your vest.

870
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:13,323
We're in.

871
01:08:33,042 --> 01:08:35,843
Z?

872
01:08:35,845 --> 01:08:38,546
Pico Rivera Savings,
Montebello Town Center.

873
01:08:38,548 --> 01:08:40,313
<i>Copy that, boss.
See you at 0800.</i>

874
01:08:40,315 --> 01:08:41,650
Tell the crew.

875
01:08:46,721 --> 01:08:48,824
I did what you told me to.

876
01:10:46,409 --> 01:10:47,911
There you go.
Good job there.

877
01:10:55,450 --> 01:10:56,685
McKenna!

878
01:11:04,327 --> 01:11:08,028
Hey, sweetie. Hey, sweetie.

879
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:11,098
How are you? Good?

880
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:12,269
What are you doing?

881
01:11:13,468 --> 01:11:16,135
Well, you know,
I was on my way to work

882
01:11:16,137 --> 01:11:19,840
and thought I'd come by and say
hello to my little monkey.

883
01:11:19,842 --> 01:11:21,709
Is that okay?

884
01:11:21,711 --> 01:11:23,876
How's everything
at school? Okay?

885
01:11:23,878 --> 01:11:25,714
- Yes, it's good.
- Yeah?

886
01:11:27,115 --> 01:11:29,551
And what about Auntie's house?

887
01:11:29,553 --> 01:11:31,354
Mommy and Cassady,
are they good?

888
01:11:37,959 --> 01:11:39,859
What about the honey-bear?
Honey-bear good?

889
01:11:39,861 --> 01:11:42,031
Yeah? You miss me?

890
01:11:47,069 --> 01:11:50,136
All right, Pookie,
better get back to class.

891
01:11:50,138 --> 01:11:52,139
When am I going
to see you again?

892
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:55,812
Soon, sweetheart.
I'm gonna see you soon.

893
01:11:57,646 --> 01:11:59,482
I want to come home.

894
01:12:02,351 --> 01:12:03,687
Me, too.

895
01:12:05,221 --> 01:12:07,924
All right, you better
get back to class, okay?

896
01:12:08,990 --> 01:12:10,327
But I'm gonna see you later.

897
01:12:11,226 --> 01:12:12,361
Promise?

898
01:12:15,064 --> 01:12:16,700
I promise.

899
01:12:18,767 --> 01:12:20,603
Come on.

900
01:12:23,739 --> 01:12:27,243
Recess is over.
Come on, kids. Come line up.

901
01:12:28,444 --> 01:12:30,046
Go on, Pookie.

902
01:12:30,713 --> 01:12:32,112
Bye, Daddy.

903
01:12:32,114 --> 01:12:33,450
Come on, McKenna.

904
01:12:35,717 --> 01:12:37,252
Come on, honey.

905
01:13:52,328 --> 01:13:53,930
Jock up.

906
01:14:01,803 --> 01:14:03,306
Tac up, brother.

907
01:14:06,509 --> 01:14:08,542
No Fed?

908
01:14:08,544 --> 01:14:10,212
Change of plans.

909
01:14:11,881 --> 01:14:13,947
Pay attention.

910
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:15,718
Always keep your finger off the trigger
until you're going to shoot somebody.

911
01:14:17,386 --> 01:14:20,687
If and when that happens,
safety selector switch.

912
01:14:20,689 --> 01:14:22,526
One for semi,
two for full auto.

913
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:43,242
Mag release.

914
01:14:43,244 --> 01:14:45,344
Out with the old,
in with the new.

915
01:14:45,346 --> 01:14:47,582
Tug it. Make sure
it's in there good.

916
01:14:47,584 --> 01:14:50,183
Slap the bolt home,
you're ready for round two.

917
01:14:50,185 --> 01:14:53,252
Other than that, keep this thing
pointed at the fucking floor.

918
01:14:53,254 --> 01:14:54,592
- You understand?
- Got it.

919
01:14:56,324 --> 01:14:57,327
Go put your shit on.

920
01:15:19,013 --> 01:15:21,417
- Magazine, Borracho?
- Yeah.

921
01:15:52,647 --> 01:15:54,784
- We good?
- We good.

922
01:16:30,985 --> 01:16:33,019
Suspects arriving on location.

923
01:16:33,021 --> 01:16:35,287
We've got nothing for the DA. They
haven't committed a crime yet.

924
01:16:35,289 --> 01:16:37,424
<i>They clear the bank,
we take them down.</i>

925
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:39,028
- <i>Stand by.</i>
- Roger that.

926
01:16:49,606 --> 01:16:51,470
Broad fucking daylight.

927
01:16:51,472 --> 01:16:52,674
They're packing big.

928
01:16:55,010 --> 01:16:58,647
Ooh, shit. Look at these
motherfuckers.

929
01:17:03,851 --> 01:17:06,019
Get down on the ground!
Get down on the ground!

930
01:17:06,021 --> 01:17:08,487
Down on the ground! Get
down on the fucking ground!

931
01:17:08,489 --> 01:17:09,556
Freeze!

932
01:17:09,558 --> 01:17:11,157
Freeze! Don't move!
Stay right there!

933
01:17:11,159 --> 01:17:12,194
Freeze!

934
01:17:13,061 --> 01:17:14,394
Freeze!

935
01:17:14,396 --> 01:17:16,328
- You two! Move! Get over there!
- Get over here!

936
01:17:16,330 --> 01:17:18,200
Hurry up!

937
01:17:20,069 --> 01:17:21,902
Get out here, now!

938
01:17:21,904 --> 01:17:25,208
Move there now! Go! Go! Go!

939
01:17:26,374 --> 01:17:29,177
Move back!
Stay right there! Now!

940
01:17:30,412 --> 01:17:32,181
Eyes to the floor!

941
01:17:35,217 --> 01:17:36,849
Listen up!

942
01:17:36,851 --> 01:17:38,984
Everybody pay the fuck
attention!

943
01:17:38,986 --> 01:17:40,420
Eyes to the ground!

944
01:17:40,422 --> 01:17:42,656
'Cause I'm only
going to say this once!

945
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:45,826
If you cooperate,
if you follow directions,

946
01:17:45,828 --> 01:17:49,895
you will not be hurt. We are
here for money, not for you.

947
01:17:49,897 --> 01:17:51,997
I want everybody lined up
on the counter. Let's go!

948
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:53,269
Move down!

949
01:17:54,002 --> 01:17:55,536
Move down! Let's go!

950
01:17:55,538 --> 01:17:58,404
Everybody behind the counter,
come out front! Let's go!

951
01:17:58,406 --> 01:18:01,209
Keep your eyes down
and your mouths shut.

952
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:04,111
On my command,

953
01:18:04,113 --> 01:18:08,215
reach inside your pockets,
remove your cell phones,

954
01:18:08,217 --> 01:18:10,951
and put your hands in the air.

955
01:18:10,953 --> 01:18:13,455
Everybody take
two steps forward.

956
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:17,126
Now go down on your knees.

957
01:18:20,028 --> 01:18:21,963
All right! Cell phones
right in here.

958
01:18:22,364 --> 01:18:23,530
On me.

959
01:18:23,532 --> 01:18:24,764
Let's go.
Put them in the box.

960
01:18:24,766 --> 01:18:25,967
Tie them up.

961
01:18:28,538 --> 01:18:30,604
Go! Go! Go!

962
01:18:30,606 --> 01:18:32,773
There will be
no heroics today.

963
01:18:32,775 --> 01:18:35,308
You guys go ahead
and get comfortable.

964
01:18:35,310 --> 01:18:37,243
We're going to
be here for a while.

965
01:18:37,245 --> 01:18:39,414
Anybody need to
use the bathroom?

966
01:18:40,583 --> 01:18:42,118
Take a piss on yourself.

967
01:18:50,593 --> 01:18:51,627
Hey.

968
01:18:58,132 --> 01:19:00,635
You. Get up.

969
01:19:01,970 --> 01:19:02,972
Stop.

970
01:19:07,241 --> 01:19:08,579
Sit down.

971
01:19:14,348 --> 01:19:15,648
All right, I need you
to calm down right now.

972
01:19:15,650 --> 01:19:18,120
Hey! Look at me.

973
01:19:19,488 --> 01:19:20,490
Take a deep breath.

974
01:19:23,659 --> 01:19:25,192
Good.

975
01:19:25,194 --> 01:19:27,827
I know you already triggered
the silent alarms.

976
01:19:27,829 --> 01:19:29,696
So I need you
to pick up the phone,

977
01:19:29,698 --> 01:19:33,666
dial 911 dispatch,
and explain the following.

978
01:19:33,668 --> 01:19:35,337
Go ahead and write this down.

979
01:19:37,105 --> 01:19:41,609
There's a 211 in progress,
and we have hostages.

980
01:19:41,611 --> 01:19:44,376
Within one hour, they need
to deliver $10 million

981
01:19:44,378 --> 01:19:47,680
in unmarked small denomination
bills to this bank

982
01:19:47,682 --> 01:19:50,716
inside a department helicopter
loaded with fuel.

983
01:19:50,718 --> 01:19:55,287
Tell them we plan on killing one hostage
every hour until our demands are met.

984
01:19:55,289 --> 01:19:57,489
No cops are to
approach the bank.

985
01:19:57,491 --> 01:20:00,693
And if a negotiator
even tries to contact us,

986
01:20:00,695 --> 01:20:02,864
we will automatically kill
another hostage.

987
01:20:04,232 --> 01:20:06,702
Is that clear?
You got it all?

988
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:11,307
Go ahead
and pick up the phone.

989
01:20:16,912 --> 01:20:19,312
<i>Any available units,
we have a bank 211 in progress...</i>

990
01:20:19,314 --> 01:20:20,647
Shit.

991
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:21,814
<i>...at the Pico Rivera Savings
in Montebello</i>

992
01:20:21,816 --> 01:20:25,218
<i>at 2891 Wilcox and Atlantic.</i>

993
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:26,819
- <i>Suspects are armed...</i>
- What the fuck?

994
01:20:26,821 --> 01:20:28,889
<i>...and have taken hostages
and are refusing a negotiator.</i>

995
01:20:28,891 --> 01:20:31,358
What the fuck is going on?
That's not their MO.

996
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:34,760
Call in, tell them we're on scene,
have suspects under surveillance,

997
01:20:34,762 --> 01:20:36,328
and to back the fuck off.

998
01:20:36,330 --> 01:20:39,600
This is LASD, we have surveillance
on the bank. Stand down.

999
01:20:39,602 --> 01:20:43,036
I repeat,
have all units stand down.

1000
01:20:43,038 --> 01:20:44,938
It's bullshit. I can
hear them already.

1001
01:20:46,208 --> 01:20:47,276
What the fuck are they doing?

1002
01:20:53,181 --> 01:20:54,380
Stop!

1003
01:20:54,382 --> 01:20:55,684
Get out!

1004
01:21:07,562 --> 01:21:09,599
What the fuck
are you guys doing, huh?

1005
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:12,533
Asshole!

1006
01:21:12,535 --> 01:21:14,401
What the fuck are you doing?
What's going on?

1007
01:21:14,403 --> 01:21:16,368
You were running surveillance,
and you let this shit go down?

1008
01:21:16,370 --> 01:21:19,438
It's our fucking case. We've been
surveilling these guys for weeks.

1009
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:20,773
That's what surveillance is!

1010
01:21:20,775 --> 01:21:23,443
They commit a crime,
and then we stop them.

1011
01:21:23,445 --> 01:21:24,780
Go. Go to the vault.

1012
01:21:25,646 --> 01:21:26,748
Open it.

1013
01:21:41,629 --> 01:21:43,098
Let's go. Come.

1014
01:21:46,435 --> 01:21:47,770
Sit. Sit down.

1015
01:21:55,243 --> 01:21:57,810
I'm going to put this
on speaker phone.

1016
01:21:57,812 --> 01:21:59,312
You're going to answer,
but don't use any names.

1017
01:21:59,314 --> 01:22:00,616
You understand?

1018
01:22:04,352 --> 01:22:05,618
Hello?

1019
01:22:05,620 --> 01:22:07,987
<i>Hello, this is the Los Angeles
Police Department.</i>

1020
01:22:07,989 --> 01:22:09,755
<i>Who am I speaking with?</i>

1021
01:22:09,757 --> 01:22:11,157
This is the branch manager.

1022
01:22:11,159 --> 01:22:13,158
<i>Sir, I need to speak
with the person in charge.</i>

1023
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:15,094
You are.

1024
01:22:15,096 --> 01:22:18,297
<i>Okay, good. Well, let me introduce myself.
I'm Officer Parada...</i>

1025
01:22:18,299 --> 01:22:23,336
I don't give a fuck who you are.
Are our demands being met?

1026
01:22:23,338 --> 01:22:24,470
<i>Who am I talking with now?</i>

1027
01:22:24,472 --> 01:22:26,005
Answer the question.

1028
01:22:26,007 --> 01:22:27,706
It's being worked on
as we speak.

1029
01:22:27,708 --> 01:22:28,942
<i>But you need to understand...</i>

1030
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:30,178
You just killed a hostage.

1031
01:22:31,512 --> 01:22:33,015
God damn it!

1032
01:22:39,687 --> 01:22:42,488
- Get up. Get up!
- No! No! No!

1033
01:22:42,490 --> 01:22:44,189
Come on, move!

1034
01:22:44,191 --> 01:22:46,560
I didn't do anything. Please.
What are you doing?

1035
01:22:46,562 --> 01:22:51,033
- Come on.
- No! No! No!

1036
01:22:55,369 --> 01:22:56,502
Fuck!

1037
01:22:56,504 --> 01:22:58,371
- You were on it, huh?
- Shit!

1038
01:22:58,373 --> 01:22:59,805
You're so full of shit,
O'Brien...

1039
01:22:59,807 --> 01:23:01,707
You heard the demands,
you stupid motherfucker!

1040
01:23:01,709 --> 01:23:04,877
- Yeah.
- You put a negotiator on? Christ!

1041
01:23:04,879 --> 01:23:06,379
- Fuck you!
- Fuck me?

1042
01:23:06,381 --> 01:23:07,547
Yeah, fuck you!

1043
01:23:07,549 --> 01:23:09,515
Fucking nice haircut,
you fucking idiot.

1044
01:23:09,517 --> 01:23:10,983
Who are you
fucking pushing now?

1045
01:23:10,985 --> 01:23:12,352
Are you fucking kidding?

1046
01:23:12,354 --> 01:23:14,487
- Get SWAT rolling right now!
- You fucking pussy.

1047
01:23:14,489 --> 01:23:16,221
Fucking Lobbin' Bob is angry!

1048
01:23:16,223 --> 01:23:18,559
- All right, boss, let's go. Let's go.
- Shitheads!

1049
01:23:18,561 --> 01:23:20,660
- Let's go.
- Fuck!

1050
01:23:20,662 --> 01:23:22,228
We've got a situation
going on...

1051
01:23:22,230 --> 01:23:23,265
Shit!

1052
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:27,236
What the fuck are you
doing, Merrimen?

1053
01:23:38,413 --> 01:23:39,879
Yeah?

1054
01:23:39,881 --> 01:23:42,381
This is the Police Department.
Please don't hang up.

1055
01:23:42,383 --> 01:23:44,084
My name's Danny,

1056
01:23:44,086 --> 01:23:46,419
I'll be your only contact. Nobody
else is going to call you.

1057
01:23:46,421 --> 01:23:48,420
<i>Is this the person in charge?</i>

1058
01:23:48,422 --> 01:23:50,189
This is the branch manager.

1059
01:23:50,191 --> 01:23:53,760
I'm speaking on the
man in charge's behalf.

1060
01:23:53,762 --> 01:23:55,761
<i>Do you have a name,
branch manager?</i>

1061
01:23:57,431 --> 01:24:00,902
Listen. They've already killed
one of the hostages. A woman.

1062
01:24:02,104 --> 01:24:04,103
They will not
speak to you again.

1063
01:24:04,105 --> 01:24:07,608
If you call back again before their
demands are met, they'll kill another.

1064
01:24:07,610 --> 01:24:09,609
Just send what they want.

1065
01:24:09,611 --> 01:24:11,578
<i>The money and the chopper
are en route,</i>

1066
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:13,246
<i>but it's going to take
a little bit of time.</i>

1067
01:24:13,248 --> 01:24:16,485
<i>You need to give me at least
90 minutes. Is this doable?</i>

1068
01:24:18,753 --> 01:24:20,756
Okay. Don't call back.

1069
01:24:46,013 --> 01:24:47,279
What's the prefix here?

1070
01:24:47,281 --> 01:24:48,617
562. It's Long Beach.

1071
01:24:55,624 --> 01:24:57,322
Hello?

1072
01:24:57,324 --> 01:24:58,527
You watching?

1073
01:25:03,164 --> 01:25:04,165
Yup.

1074
01:25:09,337 --> 01:25:11,272
So how the hell are you going
to get out of this one?

1075
01:25:12,973 --> 01:25:14,476
Not sure yet.

1076
01:25:18,614 --> 01:25:20,816
Did you get my number
from her cell?

1077
01:25:27,623 --> 01:25:29,225
I ain't cuffing up.

1078
01:25:31,825 --> 01:25:33,462
That's okay.

1079
01:25:34,863 --> 01:25:37,399
I didn't bring
my cuffs anyway.

1080
01:25:39,133 --> 01:25:40,869
Yeah, I can see that.

1081
01:26:01,222 --> 01:26:02,757
Was that who I think it was?

1082
01:26:03,424 --> 01:26:04,593
Yup.

1083
01:26:11,732 --> 01:26:13,265
We've got a chopper
that's gonna come down.

1084
01:26:13,267 --> 01:26:14,936
The chopper is going to land
right over here.

1085
01:26:23,043 --> 01:26:27,282
I've got two-door entry on one.
One-door entry on two.

1086
01:26:28,917 --> 01:26:29,919
Breaching!

1087
01:26:36,958 --> 01:26:38,595
Well, they just
blew the vault.

1088
01:26:39,261 --> 01:26:40,629
What the fuck?

1089
01:26:51,071 --> 01:26:52,438
<i>Federal Reserve,
accounts receiving.</i>

1090
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:54,273
Hey, it's Al at Alameda.

1091
01:26:54,275 --> 01:26:56,943
We have a drop at Pico Rivera
we need to schedule.

1092
01:26:56,945 --> 01:26:58,911
<i>How's Wednesday at 2:00?</i>

1093
01:26:58,913 --> 01:27:01,281
<i>That works. You're confirmed
for 2:00 p.m. the 18th.</i>

1094
01:27:01,283 --> 01:27:03,483
<i>Great. Thanks.</i>

1095
01:27:03,485 --> 01:27:05,054
- We're here, yeah?
- Yeah, that's us.

1096
01:27:06,288 --> 01:27:07,656
So what is this?

1097
01:27:08,624 --> 01:27:10,156
This is the sewer line,

1098
01:27:10,158 --> 01:27:12,928
and according to this map right
here, it's all cemented up.

1099
01:27:33,147 --> 01:27:34,482
Hey, where are we
with the chopper?

1100
01:27:35,316 --> 01:27:37,483
We're waiting on clearance.

1101
01:27:37,485 --> 01:27:39,484
Relax, they're not
going anywhere.

1102
01:27:39,486 --> 01:27:42,822
To hell with clearance.
We've got to move.

1103
01:27:42,824 --> 01:27:44,260
O'Brien, hey!

1104
01:27:45,659 --> 01:27:48,327
Is he off his meds?

1105
01:27:48,329 --> 01:27:50,330
Tell him to get
the fuck back here!

1106
01:27:50,332 --> 01:27:51,831
Will you shut the fuck up?

1107
01:27:51,833 --> 01:27:53,002
Oh, fuck you.

1108
01:28:03,177 --> 01:28:05,711
We better go back him up.

1109
01:28:05,713 --> 01:28:07,279
Nick's heading to the front.
We're on the move.

1110
01:28:07,281 --> 01:28:08,284
Here we go.

1111
01:28:13,954 --> 01:28:15,957
- Fuck!
- Is he serious?

1112
01:28:39,213 --> 01:28:40,546
Everybody okay?

1113
01:28:40,548 --> 01:28:41,883
Yes.

1114
01:28:47,721 --> 01:28:52,258
Please, Lord, please,
let me see my family again.

1115
01:29:07,409 --> 01:29:08,410
- Nick!
- Sheriff's Department.

1116
01:29:09,910 --> 01:29:11,077
Nick!

1117
01:29:11,079 --> 01:29:12,114
Clear!

1118
01:29:15,382 --> 01:29:16,751
Clear!

1119
01:29:24,391 --> 01:29:26,596
- The fuck?
- Nick, what's your location?

1120
01:29:30,464 --> 01:29:31,766
<i>What's your location?</i>

1121
01:29:40,275 --> 01:29:42,442
Hey, this is Al
at Alameda again.

1122
01:29:42,444 --> 01:29:44,977
I forgot to schedule a drop
at the Pico Rivera Savings.

1123
01:29:44,979 --> 01:29:46,616
What do you have open today?

1124
01:29:54,155 --> 01:29:56,656
<i>Ghetto Bird, this is Silverback.
We confirmed?</i>

1125
01:29:56,658 --> 01:30:00,128
Check. Appointment's at 2:45.
That's in two minutes.

1126
01:30:14,007 --> 01:30:15,276
Pico Rivera.

1127
01:30:23,952 --> 01:30:25,818
Horsepower all set?

1128
01:30:25,820 --> 01:30:27,322
<i>Yeah, I'm ready to go.</i>

1129
01:30:41,636 --> 01:30:43,169
They got you
on a new route?

1130
01:30:43,171 --> 01:30:46,037
Yeah. Yeah, they just
switched us over this week.

1131
01:30:46,039 --> 01:30:49,774
All right. Let me
get you guys' IDs, man.

1132
01:30:49,776 --> 01:30:52,513
Yeah, sure. There you go.

1133
01:31:00,120 --> 01:31:01,522
All right.

1134
01:31:02,356 --> 01:31:03,855
You're good to go.

1135
01:31:03,857 --> 01:31:06,028
- All right, thank you.
- Open the gate. Have a good one.

1136
01:31:47,534 --> 01:31:48,537
Oh, fuck.

1137
01:31:58,713 --> 01:32:01,080
Pico Rivera Savings? 2.2?

1138
01:32:01,082 --> 01:32:02,582
Yup, that's us.

1139
01:32:02,584 --> 01:32:03,950
Bring her up.

1140
01:32:03,952 --> 01:32:05,921
All right, ready.
One, two, three.

1141
01:32:13,226 --> 01:32:15,229
- Sign here.
- You got it.

1142
01:32:16,565 --> 01:32:17,900
You're new here, Mark?

1143
01:32:18,932 --> 01:32:20,135
Yes, sir.

1144
01:32:22,369 --> 01:32:23,803
You guys running
a little bit late.

1145
01:32:23,805 --> 01:32:26,909
Yeah, we ran into
some traffic, so...

1146
01:32:28,611 --> 01:32:30,242
I don't know where they had
you guys routed before,

1147
01:32:30,244 --> 01:32:32,546
but we run a tight, tight ship
around here,

1148
01:32:32,548 --> 01:32:34,947
so, if you're going to be
late, have base call it in.

1149
01:32:34,949 --> 01:32:36,415
Yeah, no problem.
That's my fault. I just...

1150
01:32:36,417 --> 01:32:38,787
Just have them call.

1151
01:32:39,787 --> 01:32:40,923
On me.

1152
01:33:19,793 --> 01:33:22,495
Hey, Luigi. Alameda's on deck.
Check them in.

1153
01:33:22,497 --> 01:33:23,664
Copy that.

1154
01:33:24,164 --> 01:33:25,466
New guys.

1155
01:33:26,633 --> 01:33:28,302
I'm going to
step out for a minute.

1156
01:33:55,696 --> 01:33:57,028
How you guys doing today?

1157
01:33:57,030 --> 01:33:58,833
- Good. All right.
- Good.

1158
01:34:04,739 --> 01:34:05,904
How you doing?

1159
01:34:05,906 --> 01:34:08,541
- All right, how are you?
- Good, thank you.

1160
01:34:08,543 --> 01:34:10,078
Sign that for me, please.

1161
01:34:12,713 --> 01:34:14,714
All hundreds?

1162
01:34:14,716 --> 01:34:17,519
The first one's all hundreds.
The second one is mixed.

1163
01:34:18,519 --> 01:34:19,984
We're a little backed up.

1164
01:34:19,986 --> 01:34:21,555
All right, do what you can.

1165
01:34:21,557 --> 01:34:23,822
Guys want to hang out, get a Coke
or something? Appreciate you.

1166
01:34:23,824 --> 01:34:24,825
Thank you.

1167
01:34:35,369 --> 01:34:37,702
We're going to need access
to the recording off-site.

1168
01:34:37,704 --> 01:34:39,404
Can you get that to us?

1169
01:34:39,406 --> 01:34:41,376
- Understood.
- You need professional help.

1170
01:34:42,110 --> 01:34:43,242
Desperately.

1171
01:34:43,244 --> 01:34:45,914
My bad last time.
Your crime scene.

1172
01:35:13,074 --> 01:35:16,108
Silverback, this
is Horsepower. I'm in.

1173
01:35:16,110 --> 01:35:19,647
Greenpeace, this is Silverback.
Horsepower is in.

1174
01:35:21,414 --> 01:35:23,784
Roger that, Silverback.
Lights out.

1175
01:35:31,958 --> 01:35:33,494
Okay, here we go.

1176
01:35:36,597 --> 01:35:38,964
Johnny, we're fucking brown
again, man.

1177
01:35:38,966 --> 01:35:41,069
Got to shut down. Pull them
out of the count rooms.

1178
01:35:42,169 --> 01:35:44,636
We're going brown.

1179
01:35:44,638 --> 01:35:47,007
We've got to shut down for a bit.
All teams go ahead and take 10.

1180
01:35:57,251 --> 01:35:58,317
Luigi, come on.

1181
01:35:58,319 --> 01:36:00,689
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1182
01:36:13,467 --> 01:36:15,337
They went to brown.
They're clearing out.

1183
01:36:17,538 --> 01:36:19,107
- Let's lock it down.
- Copy.

1184
01:36:24,811 --> 01:36:26,147
Get ready to go.

1185
01:36:38,726 --> 01:36:40,195
<i>Powering up EMP now.</i>

1186
01:36:46,633 --> 01:36:47,867
All clear here.

1187
01:36:47,869 --> 01:36:48,870
Good to go.

1188
01:36:52,006 --> 01:36:53,240
You're clear. Go.

1189
01:37:01,315 --> 01:37:02,982
Shit. Check something out.

1190
01:37:02,984 --> 01:37:04,550
What do you think it is?

1191
01:37:04,553 --> 01:37:06,221
Are the cameras up
in the 100 room?

1192
01:37:06,988 --> 01:37:08,722
Uh, negative.

1193
01:37:14,262 --> 01:37:16,428
555-0143.

1194
01:37:16,430 --> 01:37:17,567
It's taking too long.

1195
01:37:18,599 --> 01:37:19,898
Tasty Orders.

1196
01:37:19,900 --> 01:37:21,233
<i>This is Sharon at the Fed.</i>

1197
01:37:21,235 --> 01:37:23,501
<i>Now, we ordered almost
an hour and a half ago.</i>

1198
01:37:23,503 --> 01:37:25,371
<i>Now, I only have so much time
on my lunch break.</i>

1199
01:37:25,373 --> 01:37:27,573
It coming!
Be there in a few minute!

1200
01:37:27,575 --> 01:37:29,174
They just called
for the Chinese.

1201
01:37:29,176 --> 01:37:30,278
<i>Hurry it up.</i>

1202
01:37:33,713 --> 01:37:35,447
Motion is out in there, too.

1203
01:37:35,449 --> 01:37:36,751
Yeah, man, we're still brown.

1204
01:37:38,852 --> 01:37:41,420
You know, we better override.
Power it up.

1205
01:37:41,422 --> 01:37:42,424
All right.

1206
01:37:44,792 --> 01:37:45,890
Done.

1207
01:37:45,892 --> 01:37:47,462
Okay. Better get
that count, too.

1208
01:37:59,373 --> 01:38:01,941
Shit, here comes security.
Get down. Get down.

1209
01:38:01,943 --> 01:38:04,614
Hey, man, we got to check this 100 count.
Motion went off.

1210
01:38:12,485 --> 01:38:13,786
Luigi...

1211
01:38:13,788 --> 01:38:15,290
Step on it.
Step on it, quick.

1212
01:38:17,592 --> 01:38:18,724
Yeah?

1213
01:38:18,726 --> 01:38:20,158
- Luigi.
- <i>Yeah?</i>

1214
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:23,429
Damn, dude! Luigi, you're
stepping on the line, man!

1215
01:38:23,431 --> 01:38:25,096
Say again? Russell?

1216
01:38:25,098 --> 01:38:27,769
Hey, dumb-dumb. You've got to
let go of the push to talk.

1217
01:38:30,637 --> 01:38:32,439
What the hell is
going on here today?

1218
01:38:35,943 --> 01:38:37,309
<i>Luigi, man. He's stepping
all over the line.</i>

1219
01:38:37,311 --> 01:38:38,810
<i>He's</i> hot-micing
<i>like a motherfucker.</i>

1220
01:38:38,812 --> 01:38:41,346
He's in the cafeteria.
Go ahead and get him.

1221
01:38:41,348 --> 01:38:43,318
<i>All right. Roger that.
I'm stepping out.</i>

1222
01:38:52,025 --> 01:38:53,260
You're clear. Go.

1223
01:39:01,502 --> 01:39:02,504
Holy shit.

1224
01:39:40,074 --> 01:39:41,874
Luigi, you're hot-micing.

1225
01:39:41,876 --> 01:39:43,809
You've got to let go of the talk button.
You're stepping on the line.

1226
01:39:43,811 --> 01:39:45,810
Dude, it's not me.

1227
01:39:45,812 --> 01:39:48,380
Come on, we've got to check the 100 count.
Let's go. Get Junior. Let's go.

1228
01:39:48,382 --> 01:39:50,049
<i>Switch to line five.</i>

1229
01:39:50,051 --> 01:39:51,886
You got about a minute and a
half, two minutes. Let's go.

1230
01:40:20,748 --> 01:40:21,850
They're back. Get out.

1231
01:41:01,321 --> 01:41:03,388
Luigi, you see anything, man?

1232
01:41:03,390 --> 01:41:05,323
Yeah, we're good. There's
nothing back there but dust.

1233
01:41:05,325 --> 01:41:07,259
What am I looking for?

1234
01:41:07,261 --> 01:41:08,894
Don't worry about it, man. I'm gonna
juice up the room. Run the count,

1235
01:41:08,896 --> 01:41:10,765
- <i>and make sure we're good, all right?</i>
- Copy that.

1236
01:41:11,765 --> 01:41:13,965
Where are you?

1237
01:41:13,967 --> 01:41:15,836
This is Horsepower.
I'm in the vents.

1238
01:41:22,909 --> 01:41:24,612
Greenpeace, you're done.
Cut out.

1239
01:41:28,082 --> 01:41:30,681
We are back up, brother.

1240
01:41:30,683 --> 01:41:32,854
All teams,
back to the count room.

1241
01:41:35,321 --> 01:41:36,955
Get on with LAPD Central.

1242
01:41:36,957 --> 01:41:40,091
Tell them we're running
surveillance at 8th and Grand.

1243
01:41:40,093 --> 01:41:43,161
<i>Request a Code 5. We do not
wanna spook the suspects.</i>

1244
01:41:43,163 --> 01:41:44,998
<i>Copy that.
Putting in a Code 5.</i>

1245
01:41:47,333 --> 01:41:50,135
Am I tripping or
was this full before?

1246
01:41:50,137 --> 01:41:51,506
Let's just check the count.

1247
01:42:21,467 --> 01:42:22,537
$712,200.

1248
01:42:24,572 --> 01:42:26,007
$712,200.

1249
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:29,310
Russell, the count is on.

1250
01:42:30,878 --> 01:42:33,144
All right, roger that. Go
ahead and clock out Alameda.

1251
01:42:33,146 --> 01:42:34,548
Take Alameda out.

1252
01:42:56,736 --> 01:42:58,536
The count was good.

1253
01:42:58,538 --> 01:43:00,706
But both of your bins
were half-full.

1254
01:43:00,708 --> 01:43:02,374
Sorry?

1255
01:43:02,376 --> 01:43:04,244
Your bins,
they were half-full.

1256
01:43:05,614 --> 01:43:07,045
That's how we got them.

1257
01:43:07,047 --> 01:43:10,849
Next time, just put it
in a cash sack.

1258
01:43:10,851 --> 01:43:12,550
Makes things a lot easier.

1259
01:43:12,552 --> 01:43:14,853
Try and work smart, not hard.

1260
01:43:14,855 --> 01:43:16,089
Okay, sounds good.
Thanks for the advice.

1261
01:45:04,397 --> 01:45:08,200
We would tip you, honey, but that
just took too damn long, okay?

1262
01:45:08,202 --> 01:45:10,204
I'm the only guy they've got
delivering today. I'm sorry.

1263
01:45:36,730 --> 01:45:39,100
Sorry, guys, let me see
your drop confirmation again.

1264
01:45:41,001 --> 01:45:42,270
- All right.
- There you go.

1265
01:45:58,685 --> 01:46:00,254
Chinese food guy?

1266
01:46:00,954 --> 01:46:02,523
Go on. Buzz him in.

1267
01:46:07,927 --> 01:46:09,062
Hold him there.

1268
01:46:12,266 --> 01:46:13,401
2-4-5.

1269
01:46:20,239 --> 01:46:21,576
Yeah, send him through.

1270
01:46:24,378 --> 01:46:26,881
Come here for a sec, buddy.

1271
01:46:29,616 --> 01:46:31,452
Yeah, man, I don't
have you signed in.

1272
01:46:35,388 --> 01:46:37,221
Where's your name?

1273
01:46:37,223 --> 01:46:40,291
Come on, man, I signed my name with
a dude from the last shift, man.

1274
01:46:40,293 --> 01:46:41,561
I don't know what to tell you.

1275
01:46:45,332 --> 01:46:46,430
Mmm-mmm.

1276
01:46:46,432 --> 01:46:48,136
Damn you finicky.

1277
01:46:49,269 --> 01:46:50,734
- I'm getting my money back.
- Okay.

1278
01:46:50,736 --> 01:46:52,804
- I'm getting my money back.
- Okay.

1279
01:46:52,806 --> 01:46:53,808
That's all I need.

1280
01:46:59,178 --> 01:47:01,145
All right, you boys
are good to go.

1281
01:47:01,147 --> 01:47:02,680
- Thank you very much, Officer.
- Take it easy.

1282
01:47:02,682 --> 01:47:04,185
- You have a good day.
- All right.

1283
01:47:10,857 --> 01:47:13,160
- Go on. Get out of here.
- Thank you.

1284
01:47:16,797 --> 01:47:18,599
Yes, security in
the lobby, please.

1285
01:47:27,874 --> 01:47:29,006
Lobby.

1286
01:47:29,008 --> 01:47:31,009
Yeah, did you see
a delivery guy?

1287
01:47:31,011 --> 01:47:33,381
Red shirt, light skin.
About 6 foot.

1288
01:47:34,815 --> 01:47:36,884
- Wait, what?
- Stop him.

1289
01:47:41,288 --> 01:47:44,192
You got eyes on the 1-2 side?
We'll cover the 3-4 corner.

1290
01:47:45,191 --> 01:47:46,660
Copy that.

1291
01:47:59,006 --> 01:48:01,206
Got held up at security.
What's your location?

1292
01:48:01,208 --> 01:48:04,075
South on Grand,
just past Vernon.

1293
01:48:04,077 --> 01:48:06,711
<i>Go right on Gage.
Right on Gage.</i>

1294
01:48:06,713 --> 01:48:07,748
Copy that.

1295
01:48:29,002 --> 01:48:30,902
Move! Let's go! Get out!

1296
01:48:30,904 --> 01:48:33,371
- Come on, move! Move! Here we go!
- It's cool.

1297
01:48:33,373 --> 01:48:34,942
- Come on, get down! Go! Go! Go!
- It's cool. I'm cool, man.

1298
01:48:35,610 --> 01:48:36,944
Be cool, bro. Cool.

1299
01:48:38,678 --> 01:48:40,080
Fuck.

1300
01:48:59,466 --> 01:49:01,232
There he is. There he is.
Red shirt. Two blocks ahead.

1301
01:49:01,234 --> 01:49:03,033
Eyes on suspect.

1302
01:49:03,035 --> 01:49:07,138
Walking eastbound on 9th, approaching
Hill, south side of street.

1303
01:49:07,140 --> 01:49:09,573
Pull up in front of him,
in front of him.

1304
01:49:09,575 --> 01:49:11,209
Let's get this motherfucker.

1305
01:49:11,211 --> 01:49:12,812
Let's ram his bitch-ass
into the gate first.

1306
01:49:15,616 --> 01:49:18,084
Get in the fucking car!
Come on. Get in.

1307
01:49:19,886 --> 01:49:21,155
Fuck.

1308
01:49:21,623 --> 01:49:22,722
Hit him!

1309
01:49:31,664 --> 01:49:33,734
Motherfucker.

1310
01:49:50,417 --> 01:49:52,820
All right, let's go. Let's go. Let's
get it done as quick as we can.

1311
01:49:57,958 --> 01:49:59,924
Little fuck.

1312
01:49:59,926 --> 01:50:02,363
Where is he?
Where the fuck is he, asshole?

1313
01:50:03,329 --> 01:50:04,332
Fuck.

1314
01:50:06,999 --> 01:50:08,868
<i>Fucking... Fucker!</i>

1315
01:50:10,803 --> 01:50:13,673
Give me the burner phone.
Where the fuck is he?

1316
01:50:17,944 --> 01:50:20,111
Pacific Horizon Salvage.

1317
01:50:20,113 --> 01:50:22,650
In South Gate.
That's the rally point.

1318
01:50:31,958 --> 01:50:33,825
Silverback, go.

1319
01:50:33,827 --> 01:50:35,363
<i>Horsepower's burned.</i>

1320
01:50:37,329 --> 01:50:38,830
Repeat that. I can't hear you.

1321
01:50:38,832 --> 01:50:41,032
Horsepower is burned.

1322
01:50:41,034 --> 01:50:42,670
<i>He's done.</i>

1323
01:50:44,037 --> 01:50:45,839
I'm still clean.
Where am I going, bro?

1324
01:51:05,424 --> 01:51:07,325
Fuck!

1325
01:51:07,327 --> 01:51:09,260
Let's go. Let's go.
You guys got it all?

1326
01:51:09,262 --> 01:51:10,894
- Yes, it's all in.
- Pick it up.

1327
01:51:10,896 --> 01:51:11,899
It's good.

1328
01:51:13,999 --> 01:51:17,935
Pacific Horizon Salvage.
South Gate, Alameda Corridor.

1329
01:51:17,937 --> 01:51:19,507
10-4. Headed to you.

1330
01:51:26,346 --> 01:51:27,580
What happened
to the other two?

1331
01:51:31,784 --> 01:51:33,421
They got burned.

1332
01:51:59,079 --> 01:52:00,444
Eyes on suspects.

1333
01:52:00,446 --> 01:52:02,149
Black, four-door Suburban!

1334
01:52:07,921 --> 01:52:09,789
Heading southbound on Alameda.

1335
01:52:12,324 --> 01:52:16,563
Approaching Slauson Avenue. I need
you to parallel me on Santa Fe.

1336
01:52:26,172 --> 01:52:28,007
We got some traffic up ahead.
What's going on?

1337
01:52:29,275 --> 01:52:30,577
Corridor's backed up.

1338
01:52:37,484 --> 01:52:40,120
We just turned down Alameda Corridor, heading south.

1339
01:52:49,597 --> 01:52:50,698
Shit.

1340
01:52:59,772 --> 01:53:01,773
Coming up on suspect,
six o'clock.

1341
01:53:01,775 --> 01:53:03,174
Shit.

1342
01:53:03,176 --> 01:53:05,343
Right lane is closed up ahead.

1343
01:53:05,345 --> 01:53:08,481
<i>I repeat, right lane is
closed up ahead.</i>

1344
01:53:13,320 --> 01:53:15,621
You guys see that?

1345
01:53:15,623 --> 01:53:17,691
Twenty, 30 cars back.
What is that?

1346
01:53:21,695 --> 01:53:22,963
Is that...

1347
01:53:27,833 --> 01:53:29,869
Okay, we're at
a stop, stop, stop.

1348
01:53:32,038 --> 01:53:33,707
Fuck backup.
We've got to move now.

1349
01:53:34,574 --> 01:53:35,876
Fuck.

1350
01:53:43,249 --> 01:53:44,350
Yup.

1351
01:53:50,390 --> 01:53:51,723
That's them.

1352
01:53:57,430 --> 01:53:59,663
- Give me my vest.
- Yeah.

1353
01:53:59,665 --> 01:54:01,235
Yeah, here we go.

1354
01:54:04,905 --> 01:54:07,404
Okay, we've got them pinched in. We've
got to move before it opens up.

1355
01:54:07,406 --> 01:54:08,741
Cuff him up.

1356
01:54:18,685 --> 01:54:21,251
Be advised, suspects wearing
body armor.

1357
01:54:21,253 --> 01:54:24,054
No center mass shots.
Limb and head shots only.

1358
01:54:24,056 --> 01:54:25,258
Copy that.
Go around right here.

1359
01:54:30,030 --> 01:54:31,532
It's jammed up.

1360
01:54:38,637 --> 01:54:40,640
Good? Okay, let's go.

1361
01:54:51,551 --> 01:54:53,451
- Oh, shit.
- What?

1362
01:54:53,453 --> 01:54:54,588
They're getting
out of the car.

1363
01:55:00,493 --> 01:55:02,126
Z, go down the right.

1364
01:55:02,128 --> 01:55:05,129
Gus, Borracho, center with me.

1365
01:55:05,131 --> 01:55:07,735
Murph, stay on the left.
Don't come in.

1366
01:55:08,635 --> 01:55:10,236
- Pass me the saw.
- Fuck.

1367
01:55:12,638 --> 01:55:14,240
Let's go.

1368
01:55:15,141 --> 01:55:16,310
Stay down. Stay down.

1369
01:55:43,703 --> 01:55:45,039
Get down. Get down.

1370
01:55:49,308 --> 01:55:51,311
- Sheriff's Department. Stay down.
- Get down. Get down.

1371
01:55:58,885 --> 01:56:01,120
- Get down.
- Sheriff's Department, stay down.

1372
01:56:04,289 --> 01:56:06,459
Get down. Get down.
Stay by the engine block.

1373
01:56:09,796 --> 01:56:11,332
Get down behind the wheel.

1374
01:56:18,872 --> 01:56:20,406
Sheriff's Department.
Lady, get in the car.

1375
01:56:26,413 --> 01:56:27,513
Oh, shit.

1376
01:56:30,216 --> 01:56:31,485
Borracho!

1377
01:56:37,891 --> 01:56:38,926
Moving!

1378
01:56:41,561 --> 01:56:42,563
Moving.

1379
01:57:01,580 --> 01:57:05,416
Gus, Murph, you two go across
and cut them off, okay?

1380
01:57:05,418 --> 01:57:07,855
Tony Z, you ready?

1381
01:57:08,588 --> 01:57:09,923
Let's go.

1382
01:57:32,712 --> 01:57:33,747
Moving!

1383
01:57:38,619 --> 01:57:39,621
Move!

1384
01:57:44,824 --> 01:57:47,061
Moving. Moving.

1385
01:57:52,132 --> 01:57:53,500
Mag change!

1386
01:58:00,105 --> 01:58:01,107
Moving.

1387
01:58:06,111 --> 01:58:07,181
Mag change.

1388
01:58:19,525 --> 01:58:20,526
Moving!

1389
01:58:25,765 --> 01:58:26,999
Go! Go! Peel off!

1390
01:58:37,342 --> 01:58:38,475
Tony, you okay?

1391
01:58:38,477 --> 01:58:40,180
- Yeah, go! Go!
- You okay?

1392
01:58:41,146 --> 01:58:42,149
Fuck!

1393
01:58:47,186 --> 01:58:48,187
Go!

1394
01:58:56,162 --> 01:58:57,164
Cover!

1395
01:59:02,235 --> 01:59:03,237
Move.

1396
01:59:13,346 --> 01:59:14,515
Fuck!

1397
01:59:31,330 --> 01:59:32,763
Brick wall! Brick wall!

1398
01:59:32,765 --> 01:59:34,234
Behind the brick building!

1399
02:01:22,007 --> 02:01:23,441
My kids...

1400
02:01:24,944 --> 02:01:26,446
You're in His hands now.

1401
02:01:27,547 --> 02:01:28,848
You hear me?

1402
02:02:18,431 --> 02:02:19,433
Fuck!

1403
02:04:01,667 --> 02:04:02,869
Don't do it.

1404
02:04:29,896 --> 02:04:31,528
Told you.

1405
02:04:46,712 --> 02:04:48,647
Yeah. You did.

1406
02:05:51,910 --> 02:05:53,312
What the fuck?

1407
02:06:04,624 --> 02:06:05,824
You see this?

1408
02:06:06,958 --> 02:06:08,294
Here. Do those.

1409
02:06:13,466 --> 02:06:14,467
Oh, shit.

1410
02:06:21,140 --> 02:06:24,477
So what? They were going to
make fucking snow globes?

1411
02:06:25,645 --> 02:06:27,480
Like 10,000 of them?

1412
02:06:36,689 --> 02:06:38,589
You check on the boys?

1413
02:06:38,591 --> 02:06:40,660
Yeah, I'm going
to roll to the hospital.

1414
02:06:45,330 --> 02:06:47,601
You gonna call
Borracho's wife?

1415
02:06:56,275 --> 02:06:57,377
Yeah.

1416
02:07:00,546 --> 02:07:02,015
All right.

1417
02:07:04,150 --> 02:07:05,685
This won't go to Harbor.

1418
02:07:24,637 --> 02:07:26,406
I'm sorry you lost
one of your guys.

1419
02:07:28,373 --> 02:07:29,572
Thanks.

1420
02:07:29,574 --> 02:07:31,041
You all right?

1421
02:07:31,043 --> 02:07:32,479
Yeah, I'm okay.

1422
02:07:33,878 --> 02:07:35,245
Yeah.

1423
02:07:35,247 --> 02:07:38,418
Nick, you've got to stop
smoking, man.

1424
02:07:39,217 --> 02:07:40,220
Here.

1425
02:07:42,053 --> 02:07:43,422
It's organic.

1426
02:07:51,896 --> 02:07:54,533
You know everything was accounted
for at the Fed, right?

1427
02:07:56,936 --> 02:07:58,271
Apparently so.

1428
02:09:28,860 --> 02:09:30,329
Hey, is Donnie around?

1429
02:09:32,263 --> 02:09:33,333
He quit.

1430
02:09:35,834 --> 02:09:37,436
So you haven't
seen him anywhere?

1431
02:09:38,771 --> 02:09:40,340
I said he quit.

1432
02:09:41,172 --> 02:09:42,374
Two days ago.

1433
02:09:58,022 --> 02:09:59,359
You want a beer?

1434
02:10:00,124 --> 02:10:03,026
Very much so. Like 50.

1435
02:10:09,368 --> 02:10:11,070
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1436
02:10:25,818 --> 02:10:28,484
Did you see that new chick?
Little fat-ass?

1437
02:10:28,486 --> 02:10:31,257
The new girl who
works down the hall?

1438
02:10:32,391 --> 02:10:34,825
What's going on, gentlemen?

1439
02:10:34,827 --> 02:10:36,827
- Gentlemen, good to see you.
- Yo!

1440
02:10:36,829 --> 02:10:41,000
- Good to see you.
- Your wife know where you are?

1441
02:10:56,414 --> 02:10:57,781
How did you get that job?

1442
02:10:57,783 --> 02:10:59,084
Can you actually count?

1443
02:11:00,753 --> 02:11:02,920
<i>I'm in complete
control of my environment.</i>

1444
02:11:02,922 --> 02:11:04,022
People don't even know.

1445
02:11:32,985 --> 02:11:34,721
Fucking <i>Fräulein.</i>

1446
02:11:44,296 --> 02:11:46,330
What's going on, boys?

1447
02:11:46,332 --> 02:11:47,667
How you doing? You good?

1448
02:11:48,632 --> 02:11:49,801
Some beers?

1449
02:11:50,302 --> 02:11:51,835
Hey, guv.

1450
02:11:51,837 --> 02:11:53,439
A round of beers for my mates.

1451
02:11:54,405 --> 02:11:56,139
And for you?

1452
02:11:56,141 --> 02:11:57,143
I'm easy.

1453
02:12:02,146 --> 02:12:03,315
I don't know.

1454
02:12:03,848 --> 02:12:04,851
Surprise me.

1455
02:12:07,986 --> 02:12:09,422
I can do that.

1456
02:12:10,655 --> 02:12:12,324
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1457
02:12:13,324 --> 02:12:14,858
So why you come to me?

1458
02:12:14,860 --> 02:12:16,526
You're a beast, man.

1459
02:12:16,528 --> 02:12:18,094
Plus, you're the only one
that can pull this off.

1460
02:12:18,096 --> 02:12:20,029
Listen.

1461
02:12:20,031 --> 02:12:21,999
We do this, I call the shots.

1462
02:12:22,001 --> 02:12:23,703
My crew, my job, not yours.

1463
02:12:24,703 --> 02:12:26,502
Got it?

1464
02:12:26,504 --> 02:12:28,540
- Completely understand.
- That's the way it has to be.

1465
02:12:29,842 --> 02:12:31,174
That's it.

1466
02:12:31,176 --> 02:12:32,776
It's my baby.

1467
02:12:32,778 --> 02:12:34,012
That's what I've got.

1468
02:12:35,681 --> 02:12:37,514
How did you get
a hold of all this stuff?

1469
02:12:37,516 --> 02:12:39,883
You got this all at that bar?

1470
02:12:39,885 --> 02:12:41,387
Collected it over time.

1471
02:12:43,855 --> 02:12:44,890
Wow.

1472
02:12:54,799 --> 02:12:55,901
Job for Superman.

1473
02:13:09,248 --> 02:13:11,348
Cheers.

1474
02:13:11,350 --> 02:13:13,550
Thank you. I love when
you call me Princess.

1475
02:13:14,887 --> 02:13:16,255
You work across the street?

1476
02:13:16,922 --> 02:13:17,924
Yeah.

1477
02:13:18,589 --> 02:13:20,223
Diamond exchange?

1478
02:13:20,225 --> 02:13:21,227
That's right.

1479
02:13:25,064 --> 02:13:26,332
Beer's on me.

1480
