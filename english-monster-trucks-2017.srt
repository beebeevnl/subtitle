258
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,831
That's what I'm tutoring you in.

259
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,992
How often do they discover new species?

260
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,435
Seriously?

261
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,273
I was just watching a show on this.

262
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,556
Do you watch Nat Geo?

263
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,630
No.

264
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,510
Oh.

265
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:25,517
Well, um, they said that they discover,
like, 15,000 new species every year.

266
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,796
So, would it be possible for there to be,

267
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,032
like, a giant sea creature
here in North Dakota?

268
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,636
Technically, totally.

269
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,360
This whole state was under
an ocean at one point.

270
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,750
So theoretically,

271
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,873
the deep lakes
could have something like that.

272
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,074
I mean on land.
A giant sea creature on land.

273
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,635
Well, no.

274
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,475
Because its body evolved
in a water environment,

275
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,029
so it wouldn't be able to move
with the effects of gravity pulling on it.

Okay, then help us get them out of here.
