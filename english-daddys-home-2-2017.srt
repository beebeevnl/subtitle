1
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:15,150
Brad!

2
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:16,990
- Bye, Daddy!
- Bye, sweetie.

3
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,230
Bye-bye, guys.
I'll pick you up on Monday!

4
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,910
- Brad!
- What's up?

5
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,990
Hey, Brad!
Looking good, buddy!

6
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,580
- Dylan, where's your retainer?
- I left it at Dad's.

7
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,120
Hey, where's your math workbook?

8
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:32,750
At Mom's house.

9
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,250
- Where are all your undies?
- I don't know.

10
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,260
How do we got so many undies?

11
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,430
Happy Birthday, buddy!

12
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,600
Brad already got me one.

13
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,050
It was my idea!

14
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,430
It was my idea!

15
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,260
Hey, look at that.

16
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,510
Guys!

17
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,860
Daddy!

18
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,230
Oh!

19
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,700
Megan, hold up!

20
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,530
Whoa!

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,030
Ahh!

22
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,410
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay.

23
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,420
Right here! Don't...
Don't leave without it.

24
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,260
Come on! Keep it moving!

25
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,510
Inside the cones!

26
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,430
Inside the cones
like an ice cream. Let's go!

27
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,680
Braddie!

28
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,590
Here you go, buddy.

29
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,180
Oh. Thanks, Braddie.

30
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,510
- Hot cocoa?
- Yeah.

31
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,470
Nice! Little marshmallows
floating around there

32
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,430
all in formation.
You are the greatest!

33
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,020
I put a little licorice root
in there, too.

34
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,270
- Oh!
- Tell me what you think.

35
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,900
- Hey, guys!
- Daddies!

36
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:42,730
- Hey! Hi, how was your day?
- Good.

37
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,740
All right, guys, hop in.

38
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:46,910
I'll get them ready and I'll
meet you at Tae Kwon Do.

39
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:49,080
- See you in 30.
- Great. Looking forward to it.

40
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,580
- Bye.
- Bye, Dad!

41
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,000
Oh!

42
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,420
- Dusty!
- Yeah?

43
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,330
Sorry. You made treats
for tonight, right?

44
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,460
No, I got the gift card.

45
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,540
I thought
you were on treats tonight.

46
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,340
No. I did gift card
and the treats for

47
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,840
the Halloween Spooktacular.

48
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,630
Oh, okay. Well, I guess
I'll hit the bakery

49
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,760
- on the way to the pageant.
- Bakery?

50
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,090
Unless you don't want me
to go to the bakery.

51
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,640
Usually, when you repeat
what I said

52
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:07,760
and you shake your head
up and down,

53
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:08,930
it really means
you don't want me to do it.

54
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,180
- I'm just thinking...
- What?

55
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,600
Maybe homemade?

56
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:14,100
Yeah. Hey! Honk at him again,
you better count your teeth!

57
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,530
No problem, Braddie.
Homemade snickerdoodles

58
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:17,690
coming right up.
One for you, too.

59
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:20,360
Should we fist bump again
or would it be awkward?

60
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,780
I don't mind
a second bump. All right.

61
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,110
Thanks, buddy.
See you tonight.

62
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,280
Bye, mate.
Thanks so much for the cocoa.

63
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,440
Bye, Daddy!

64
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:29,160
Sorry.

65
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,910
These look great.
Thank you.

66
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,460
- Look at that.
- Oh...

67
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,340
- Daddy! Karen!
- Hey! Hey, guys.

68
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:42,090
Wow, look how sexy Karen looks.

69
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,170
Leather pants and side boob.

70
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,680
That's perfect
for a school function.

71
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,310
Honey, let's expect
good things, okay?

72
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,430
I know, you're right. Right.

73
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,930
- Hey! How's it going?
- Hey.

74
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,350
- Hi.
- Hi.

75
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,770
Wow, look at you guys!

76
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,770
You and Mommy
are so sassy all the time.

77
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,900
- Hi.
- Hi.

78
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,940
Oh, hey! I got your novel.

79
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,440
- It's amazing!
- Oh, I'm glad you like it.

80
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,700
I don't know how you write

81
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,990
such powerful dialogue.

82
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,190
I mean, it must just
come naturally, right?

83
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:07,280
Aww.

84
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,950
- Like everything else.
- You're so sweet.

85
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,030
- Are you guys ready?
- Let's go.

86
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:12,960
I want my shirt like Adrianna's.

87
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,330
Uh, no. No, no, no, honey.
We're not doing that, okay?

88
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,380
Put that back in.
Look like a nice kid.

89
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,470
Welcome to
the One Horse Open Sing!

90
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,960
Before we get started,
notice we have

91
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:28,640
several professional video
and still photographers

92
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,680
to cover all your kids for free.

93
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,140
So you can all put your phones
in your pockets,

94
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,720
relax, and just be
in the moment.

95
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,770
You don't care.

96
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:40,980
Dashing through the snow

97
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,150
In a one-horse open sleigh

98
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,940
O'er the fields we go
Laughing all the way, hahaha

99
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:50,950
Bells on bobtail ring
Making spirits bright

100
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,580
What fun it is to laugh and sing

101
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,950
A sleighing song tonight

102
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,120
...eat candy Santas
and smashed potatoes

103
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,290
and dressing up my dog

104
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,790
like a reindeer.

105
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,120
That's what
Christmas means to me.

106
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,170
Thank you.

107
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,290
And now we have Megan Mayron.

108
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,170
My name is Megan Mayron,

109
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,180
and I like
Christmas presents a lot.

110
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,140
But I don't
really like Christmas.

111
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,810
My daddy was
at my first Christmases,

112
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,310
but I don't remember those ones.

113
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,990
Then we had some
with no daddy at all.

114
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:24,820
Then Brad came,

115
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:27,270
but he was always trying
way too hard

116
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,780
and making everyone
feel uncomfortable.

117
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,240
Then Daddy came back,

118
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:32,990
and Brad did a pretend Christmas

119
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,950
to show Daddy that Brad
was better than him.

120
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,580
So now we have to go
to different houses

121
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,040
to have different Christmases.

122
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,910
Me and my brother wish
we were like other families

123
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:42,370
and we had normal Christmases.

124
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,130
But we still like
our Christmas presents.

125
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,550
I want to be very clear
about that.

126
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,800
Thank you very much.

127
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,010
Enjoy paying for therapy, boys!

128
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,800
You better
shut your mouth, Jerry!

129
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,930
Absolutely, Dusty.

130
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,140
We're messing up our kids,
Brad, and it's on you.

131
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,140
On me? Why is it on me?

132
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,650
Because before you came around
we only had one Christmas.

133
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,230
So it's on you.

134
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,360
Hold on, hold on.

135
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,530
We don't have to
circle the wagons

136
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,400
every time one of the kids
expresses a negative emotion.

137
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:12,700
They're fine.

138
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,030
Kids that get up
in front of whole schools

139
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,080
and say they don't like
Christmas aren't fine, Sara.

140
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,700
Well, she said she didn't like
having two Christmases.

141
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,210
Which is on you.

142
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,040
So what if we all spend
a Christmas together?

143
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,960
A Together Christmas.
That's good.

144
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,630
Now you fixed it. See, that...

145
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,050
Now it's off of you.

146
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,550
Let's invite
Adrianna's dad, too.

147
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,710
- What?
- Yes.

148
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:31,970
Are you being serious
right now? No!

149
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,220
Put that hand down.

150
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,590
I've been nothing but nice
to that guy,

151
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,050
and he treats me like
I abducted his kid.

152
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,130
I'm not doing that.

153
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,550
Why are you messing up
the mood now, all right?

154
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,180
We wanna go tell the kids
my great idea

155
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,390
about the Together Christmas.

156
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,060
Wait, how did it become
your idea?

157
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:45,730
It was your idea, but I
named it Together Christmas.

158
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,860
People of Bikini Bottom...

159
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,910
Hey, guys?

160
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,190
Guys. Listen up,
I got a surprise.

161
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,780
Hello?

162
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,450
- Guys. We got a big surprise!
- A surprise?

163
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,040
- Another pony?
- A trampoline?

164
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,120
You leaving?

165
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:04,500
Not quite, okay? But, no,

166
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,750
we got something better
than that, okay?

167
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,210
So much better.
It's gonna be great.

168
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,040
Guys, this year, no more
back and forth at Christmas.

169
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,800
- No back and forth.
- Nope. I just said that.

170
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,550
No more back and forth
at Christmas.

171
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,100
This year, we're gonna spend
one Christmas

172
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,720
- all together, all of us!
- Yay!

173
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,890
All of us.
A Together Christmas!

174
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,060
A Together Christmas!

175
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,230
Can you be quiet?

176
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,430
A Together Christmas
like a normal family!

177
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,560
Yay!

178
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,680
I'll get it.

179
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:24,890
Hello?

180
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,570
Grandpa Kurt?

181
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,560
Daddy, Grandpa Kurt
wants to talk to you.

182
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,360
No, no, no.
Dusty, I'll just tell him...

183
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:34,410
No. It's okay, Sara.

184
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,990
Thank you.

185
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:37,820
Thanks, buddy.

186
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,580
What, Dad?

187
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,000
Yeah, long time.

188
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,670
No, I'm fine.

189
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,580
- Tomorrow?
- No.

190
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,000
I could probably
pick you up, I guess, but...

191
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,840
Hey! Psst! Guess what?
My folks are coming tomorrow.

192
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:53,920
I don't care.

193
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:56,100
- We can go together.
- You shut up.

194
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:00,520
Dad, do you want to
just text... Hello?

195
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,050
Dusty, listen to me, I think
you're approaching this

196
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,730
with way too much
negative energy.

197
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,990
Brad, you don't know
what you're talking about,

198
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,730
so shut your fat hole!

199
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,660
Dusty.

200
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,860
I'm sorry, Braddie. I'm sorry.

201
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,540
You see what he does to me?

202
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,700
He's not even here yet,

203
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:20,950
and he's already
ruining Christmas.

204
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,120
- Okay, okay, relax. Relax.
- I can't!

205
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:26,370
Look, your father hasn't met
the new evolved Dusty.

206
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:29,550
You're a progressive,
sensitive, child-first parent.

207
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,800
That's exactly the stuff
he's gonna

208
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,960
make fun of us for.
You'll see.

209
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:34,540
He's gonna scoff at everything
we do. He's a scoffer, Brad.

210
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,500
Pepe, you have
a grown son, right?

211
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,630
Sí.

212
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,390
Why don't you tell Dusty here
how much your son means to you

213
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,220
in this season of good cheer?

214
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:46,900
My son is an abysmal disappointment
whose birth I regret more each day.

215
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,320
- You see?
- He didn't say nice things

216
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,480
like you think he did, Brad.

217
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,020
Dusty, you're being silly.

218
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,820
I mean, who wouldn't be
impressed with you?

219
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,780
Come on.

220
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:55,980
Dear God!

221
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,900
He looks as if
he's been chiseled

222
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,330
from Gibraltar itself.

223
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:11,050
This is gonna come off weird,
Dusty, but he's beautiful!

224
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,210
I want to be his friend so bad.

225
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,430
- Dusty.
- Hey, Pop.

226
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:28,810
- How was your flight?
- Not bad.

227
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,190
Took 20 minutes to get
to the gate though.

228
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,230
What's with that bottleneck
you got out there, huh?

229
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:36,320
I'm sorry
our local airport tarmac's

230
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,520
not up to your standards, huh?

231
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,580
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
you designed this airport,

232
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,030
or I'd have been more sensitive.

233
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,280
Oh, I guess I'll move to a new
town with a better airport

234
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:45,490
that way
you won't be inconvenienced

235
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,950
when you show up
every five years or so.

236
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,540
Same old
Mr. Touchy. I love it.

237
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,590
Here you go, Pancho. Why don't
you bring the car around,

238
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:52,710
we'll meet you at the curb.

239
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,010
Right away, sir.

240
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,960
I mean, no, I'm sorry,
I'm not the driver.

241
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,380
No, I'm Brad.

242
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,540
The stepdad.

243
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,630
- This is Sara's husband.
- Why is he with you?

244
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,060
Dad!

245
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,350
That sweater!
He wears the red sweater,

246
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,480
so I can see him in a crowd.

247
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,940
Dad!

248
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:17,190
That's him, that's Dad.

249
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,450
Dad! Dad!

250
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:35,120
I made a sign!

251
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,630
There's my big man!

252
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,720
And this guy's raising
your kids half the time?

253
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,020
He hasn't seen his dad
in a really long time.

254
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,640
It's only been
since Thanksgiving,

255
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,060
but it feels like forever!

256
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,600
- It does!
- Oh!

257
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,060
Four weeks?
It's been a few years for us.

258
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,810
What should we do?
Want me to take my pants off?

259
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,060
Hey, where's Mom?

260
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,690
You didn't get her text?

261
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:01,360
Uncle Arny came down with
a bad case of the shingles.

262
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:03,910
- Oh, no.
- So Mom's staying back

263
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,410
- to take care of him.
- Okay.

264
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,030
But, hey, you still got me.

265
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,410
I sure do. I sure do!

266
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,710
Oh!

267
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,210
We're gonna have the best time.

268
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,210
Oh! Dusty!

269
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,120
- Hey, Don.
- Hey, Muscles, come here!

270
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,880
I've got a cold.
Stay away. Don, Don!

271
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,050
Say, Dusty,
Brad told me about this

272
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,680
Together Christmas we're doing.

273
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:29,720
You two are such wonderful,
progressive co-dads.

274
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,890
Co-dads?

275
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,550
Oh, I'm so sorry. Mr. Mayron,

276
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,810
this is my father, Don Whitaker.

277
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,390
The pleasure
is all mine, Captain!

278
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,730
You piloted
the Space Shuttle Atlantis

279
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,740
in 1992 and commanded
the Endeavour

280
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,280
on three missions in 1994!

281
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,280
All right, come on,
we're out this way.

282
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,990
Thanks, Dusty.

283
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:48,740
Say, Kurt, did you meet

284
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,540
any interesting folks
on your flight?

285
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:53,450
I met a Scotch and a pillow.

286
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,830
You know, actually,
I always pick the flights

287
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,880
that have the most connections
so that

288
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:01,580
I get to chat with as many
new people as possible.

289
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,890
Oh, so you're a lunatic.
Good to know.

290
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,880
That's me!

291
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,730
Looks like one of your neighbors

292
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,480
is getting an oversized parcel.

293
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,440
Hello!

294
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,240
Don Whitaker,
United States Postal Service!

295
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,690
Retired, but never too old

296
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,450
to lend a hand
to a fellow carrier.

297
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:27,320
Brad, I gotta tell you,

298
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,120
this baby sure gives you
a smooth ride.

299
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:30,450
Oh, thank you, Kurt.

300
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,750
Yeah, it is
surprisingly responsive.

301
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:33,870
Brad, he's not...

302
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,620
So do they take your balls
right there at the dealership,

303
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,040
or do you send them in
with the registration?

304
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,210
How does it work exactly?

305
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,590
No, no,
they didn't take my balls.

306
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,710
Just $2,000 down.

307
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,050
This your place, Dusty?
I pictured it nicer.

308
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,670
Yeah, Dusty's house is nicer.

309
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,880
This is my house.
Just thought

310
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,100
you'd like to step in
and see the kids.

311
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,260
Only if it's okay.

312
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,640
Look, we don't want to
infringe on your days.

313
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,720
Of course,
don't be silly. Come on, guys.

314
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,520
You got to ask
another man's permission

315
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:55,810
to see your own kids?

316
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,060
Unbelievable.

317
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,230
We're back! With more daddies!

318
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,110
Hey! Look how big
you two got!

319
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,450
Come on.
Don't I get a hug? Come on!

320
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,530
And who's this barroom brawler?

321
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,200
He's our brother, Griffy, silly.

322
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,700
Hey, come here, pardner.
Dusty, you never told me.

323
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,380
- Why, he looks just like you.
- Yeah, not my kid.

324
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,130
Oh, no, no, no.
I fathered that one.

325
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,210
Oh. Ah, then how does he
relate to me then?

326
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,040
Well, he is the brother
of your grandkids, Kurt.

327
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,210
- Oh. Here, here.
- Oh. Okay.

328
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,050
Hey, looking good, Buttercup.

329
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,550
Good to see you.

330
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,890
- Look who's here!
- Pop-Pop!

331
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,810
- Tell us a Pop-Pop joke!
- Ooh, ooh.

332
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,810
What's a good one? Uh, why
does a duck have feathers?

333
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,890
Why?

334
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:42,400
To cover up his butt quack.

335
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,020
Hey, kids,
I got a good one for you.

336
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,320
Two dead hookers

337
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,440
- wash up on the shore...
- Hey, hey!

338
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:49,200
- Whoa, whoa, shut up.
- No way. No way.

339
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:52,370
- Sara. How's my girl?
- Hi!

340
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:54,860
What, Ginny couldn't make it?

341
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,240
Oh, she feels terrible.

342
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:58,620
But she sent a batch of
her special cookies!

343
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:01,040
Is there milk in that kitchen?

344
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:03,090
- Yay!
- I want the first one.

345
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:05,040
I get the first one!

346
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:08,720
So he gets to be Pop-Pop
and I'm just Grandpa Kurt?

347
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:11,010
What? I'm in charge of the
cutesy grandpa names now?

348
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,180
Look, if you want a better name,

349
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,350
maybe try showing up
a little more often.

350
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,470
Tell the kids, from now on,
it's El Padre.

351
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,890
No more hooker jokes.

352
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,850
These don't taste
like La-La's cookies.

353
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,150
They taste like Chips Ahoys.

354
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,700
No, no. I sat right there
in the kitchen

355
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,870
and watched Grandma
bake them just yesterday.

356
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,020
I like them.

357
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,040
So, this co-dads thing,
is that what you call it?

358
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,370
Yeah, that's what we call it.

359
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,790
So, on his watch,
he disciplines your kids,

360
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,540
gives them advice,
tucks them in, so forth

361
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,710
and that bothers you not a bit?

362
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,040
Doesn't bother me at all.

363
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,960
And his total lack
of masculinity...

364
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,420
I mean, his weak chin

365
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,720
and soft underbelly
influencing your son,

366
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:50,390
you're good there, too?
Yeah?

367
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,760
You know what?
I'm just feeling like

368
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,130
maybe you guys
want a little privacy.

369
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,890
Stay right there, Brad,
all right?

370
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,640
He's just trying
to stir the turd.

371
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,310
You can scoff all you want.

372
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,560
Everything is rock solid

373
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,310
between me and Brad here.
In fact,

374
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,360
- best friends.
- Really?

375
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,900
- Thank you.
- Brad. Stop it.

376
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,850
- I'm good.
- Now. He gets

377
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,110
really emotional. Brad.

378
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,770
- Hey. Brother.
- Did you call me "brother"?

379
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,530
B- Dawg. Chill out, man. Relax.

380
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,160
All right? Cut it out.

381
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,290
- Brad, don't.
- I know.

382
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,790
Stop. All right, look.
Hey. Brad, stop!

383
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:22,960
Looks like you two guys
have a real solid arrangement.

384
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,290
You're spending Christmas
together and everything.

385
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,620
Speaking of which, whose place
are we doing that at?

386
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,790
We're totally happy to host
if it makes it easier.

387
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:31,470
Yeah, we could do it at
my place. I got more room.

388
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,550
We can do presents at
our place, dinner at yours.

389
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,460
Nah, all that back and forth,
who needs that?

390
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,770
This place, that place.

391
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:40,060
Why don't I book us
a great vacation spot

392
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,980
for all of us,
and we can all spend

393
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,310
the holiday week together?

394
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:44,560
- Yay! Cool!
- Thanks, El Padre.

395
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,690
I love this idea!

396
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,060
It's something extra Christmasy,

397
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,270
with lots of snow and family
activities for all of us.

398
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:53,940
Dad, I'm just worried about
finding a place,

399
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,280
you know,
this close to the holiday.

400
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:58,120
Booked it! Airbnb. All done.

401
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,950
Yay, El Padre!

402
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:02,250
It's gonna be so fun,

403
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,620
since we're all such
great friends, huh?

404
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,630
Off to the mountains.
Here we go, Griffy.

405
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,460
- Here we go.
- Big fun trip!

406
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,290
Let me get that for you, Sara.

407
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,720
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

408
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:16,470
You know, Dusty,
I think you and Kurt

409
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,470
spending some time around me
and my dad might do

410
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,130
you both some good.

411
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:21,430
Hey, don't you see
what he's up to here?

412
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,680
He thinks you and me
are harboring

413
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:23,980
bad feelings for one another

414
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,180
and sticking us together
in some cabin

415
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,810
is gonna bring out
whatever we're harboring.

416
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,480
But you're not, are you, Brad?

417
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:29,810
- I'm not what?
- Harboring!

418
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:30,890
No, I'm not harboring anything.

419
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,020
Good, 'cause I'm not
harboring anything either.

420
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,400
Okay, well, let's use
this as an opportunity

421
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:34,650
to show him
that we're not harboring.

422
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,780
'Cause we're not harboring.

423
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:37,070
You're looking at
one safe harbor right here.

424
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,200
All right, good.

425
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:39,370
You sure you want to
pack it like that?

426
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,490
Is that how you're gonna do it?

427
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,910
Look, me and Brad got
everything under control

428
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,370
as a team, okay? Right, Brad?

429
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,450
That's right.

430
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,830
Yeah, what would I know
about travel?

431
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,210
I've only been
to frickin' space.

432
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,580
What, did you pack
the space shuttle yourself?

433
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,880
You pop the trunk,
arrange all the bags

434
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,050
for you
and your little space friends?

435
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,300
I did, as a matter of fact.
Yes, I packed the shuttle.

436
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,630
That's so cool!

437
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,800
I love how you're always
jotting down ideas

438
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:00,680
for your book
in your little notepad.

439
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,260
People ever get crazy and think

440
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,890
you might be writing something
bad about them?

441
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,020
Say, uh, Brad,
would you mind doing some

442
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:11,440
"Yes, And" drills with me
on the way?

443
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:14,100
"Yes, And" thank you
for asking me.

444
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:17,110
I recently joined
an improv comedy workshop.

445
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,030
Brad's been pushing me
to do it for years.

446
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,610
Because you're so funny.

447
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,990
Yeah, I enjoy it.

448
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,120
You should look into it,
too, Kurt.

449
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,910
I'd rather look
into a loaded gun.

450
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:26,960
- Did you hear that?
- Did you just make that up?

451
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,870
- Zinger!
- That's provocative, too.

452
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,710
You ready to let me do that,
Mr. Stubborn?

453
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,460
- I got it.
- It's never gonna fit.

454
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,170
Hey, kids, no, no, no, no,

455
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,970
why don't you jump into my car
with Adrianna, all right?

456
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,420
So Grandpa Kurt here

457
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:41,470
can enjoy Pop-Pop's company
on the way up.

458
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,680
Already warmed up a spot

459
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,050
in the capsule for you, Captain!

460
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:46,220
Still never gonna fit. Ever.

461
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,350
No, I got it.
It's fitting fine.

462
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,440
I just had to put it wheels-in.

463
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,280
Perfect fit!
All right, let's go.

464
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,280
Hey, Adrianna, you know,
when we're up there,

465
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:03,450
I can teach you
how to snowboard.

466
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,000
You're not my dad.

467
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,290
All right.
It's gonna be a fun trip.

468
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:14,460
It's time for One-word Story.

469
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:15,710
Anyone can join in,

470
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,880
doesn't have to be
just Dad and I.

471
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,960
You always give us
the best start.

472
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,470
- Uncle...
- ...Thomas...

473
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,010
- ...went...
- ...tiptoeing...

474
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,300
...into the...

475
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,930
...Empire State Building.

476
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,810
Where were you going
with that one?

477
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,320
This all took place
at the pancake breakfast!

478
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:34,100
Fifty-six bottles
of beer on the wall

479
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:35,610
Fifty-six bottles of beer

480
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,860
"G." Georgia,
Georgia license plate!

481
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,780
Ready, and... Quiet Game.

482
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,290
- I'm terrible at this game!
- I can't do it!

483
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,950
- I just can't do it.
- I hate the Quiet Game!

484
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,470
We always liked the Shimpahs.

485
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,140
The movers thought
the Shimpahs' house

486
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:11,020
was our house
and almost moved us in there!

487
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,600
The wrong family!
We would've been

488
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:13,810
living with the Shimpahs!

489
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,600
Which I wouldn't have minded,

490
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:18,440
'cause I had a huge crush
on Vicky Shimpah.

491
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,020
Oh, Dad, thank you.

492
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,070
You make a five-hour trip
go by like that!

493
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,950
I just wanted everybody
to have a good time.

494
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,660
Nothing like a nice,
relaxing road trip, huh, Dad?

495
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,040
Ah, it was nothing.

496
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,330
I've been in a confined space
with a chimp.

497
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:50,890
Dylan's got a girlfriend!

498
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:52,480
No, I don't! Be quiet!

499
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,730
Yeah, you love her.

500
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,650
You want to buy her flowers
and kiss her on the lips.

501
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,480
Stop it! It's not funny!

502
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:59,270
Megan! What did I say

503
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,570
about teasing your brother
about girls?

504
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,320
She's still doing it.
And she drilled him

505
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,690
in the head with a snowball too.

506
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,650
Well, I'm not her mother.

507
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,150
Now, go take
your brother inside,

508
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,330
please. Go on, sweetie.

509
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,490
Come on, Griffy.

510
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:12,000
So Dylan's started
noticing the girls, huh?

511
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,370
You know, I think it's gonna
be time to give him the talk.

512
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:18,330
The talk? You mean the talk
about the nitty-gritty?

513
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,170
- The "nitty-gritty"?
- I'm on it, Sar-Bear.

514
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,800
I've been looking forward
to this for a long time.

515
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:23,250
I got a whole speech prepared,
all right?

516
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,760
It's all heartwarming stuff.

517
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:27,140
I'm sure you and Brad will do
a bang-up job with that.

518
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,220
Unless, uh, this isn't
a co-dadding moment?

519
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,980
- No.
- No.

520
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,730
- I mean, no, of course it is.
- It is.

521
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,140
- Yeah, it is. It's gonna be.
- Okay, yeah.

522
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,310
Yeah, we're gonna talk
to him together.

523
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,400
Oh, Dusty! I read about some
gender-neutral flashcards.

524
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,240
- Flashcards.
- Uh-huh.

525
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,480
He's got flashcards to teach
your son how to score.

526
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,870
No, of course not.

527
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:48,490
They cover human reproduction,
puberty, and hygiene.

528
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,650
Okay, great. You tee it up
with the flashcards,

529
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:52,620
and I'll knock it home
with the heartwarming speech.

530
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:53,820
All right? We got this.

531
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,990
You're all set.

532
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,380
I'll never forget when

533
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,420
Brad first started asking
questions about girls.

534
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,880
I took him out for "the talk."

535
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:05,090
He was so inquisitive
and attentive.

536
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,300
Then I dropped him back off
at his dorm.

537
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:09,380
Yeah...

538
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,390
Well, come on in.

539
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,400
Hey, look, there's a game room!

540
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,320
- Wow. Adrianna, look.
- And a pool table!

541
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:21,140
This is what I'm talking about.

542
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,320
Look at that view!

543
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:25,280
Look at all the mortise
and tenon joinery!

544
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,660
Sittin' fat.

545
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,440
Your old man sure
pulled the right rein

546
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,650
getting this place.

547
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,870
Oh, wow. I know. Better throw
you a parade, huh?

548
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,450
Oh, I am really
looking forward to that.

549
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,000
Well, you want the thank yous
printed on the bass drums

550
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,450
or the sousaphone covers?

551
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,790
Hey, did anyone bring my bag in?

552
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:45,040
My supervisor Clyde Unix...

553
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,210
He took over after
Kirby Keller retired in '86.

554
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,050
Horse farm,
upper peninsula of Michigan.

555
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:53,310
Gorgeous country,
if you ever get the chance.

556
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,310
Wow.

557
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,310
Nice shower.

558
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,400
That's weird.

559
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,900
No controls.

560
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:08,980
Hey, honey,
how do you turn the shower on?

561
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,820
Shower on.

562
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,650
Off! Shower off!

563
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,320
Shower off.

564
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,820
Gosh! Ooh!

565
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,580
Voice-activated water. Cool.

566
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,750
Water cool.

567
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,000
- Off! Shower off!
- Shower off.

568
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,090
- Water... Cool...
- Water. Shower cool.

569
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,920
- Cool the water.
- Water cool.

570
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,880
Water off! Turn off!

571
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:33,220
Off.

572
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,670
Oh, my God!

573
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,350
Oh!

574
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,600
You scored on yourself.
Friendly fire.

575
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:41,180
Eight ball, corner pocket.

576
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,770
- Ooh! No slashing.
- Yeah.

577
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,680
- Good job, babe.
- Thank you, babe.

578
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,940
Come on, Sara!

579
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,860
No, that is holding.

580
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,280
It's too loud, Dylan!
Turn it down!

581
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:56,410
I don't know how!

582
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,110
Hey, hey, hey, turn that down!

583
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,040
Griffy's asleep.

584
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,130
Why are you dressed like
a woman, Brad?

585
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,340
Oh, I can't find my stuff.

586
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:08,130
Are you sure you got my bag
to fit in the car?

587
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,630
Yeah, of course.
It fit perfect.

588
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,800
Look, can we skip this one?
I can't stand this song.

589
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:14,930
- Skip it. Skip it, guys.
- Oh, no, no, no! No, Sara.

590
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,590
This is a great song.

591
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,190
This is my real dad's
favorite Christmas song.

592
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:21,060
Yeah, well, I'm glad
it makes him happy.

593
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,850
You think I don't want
to like this song?

594
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,020
Of course I want to,

595
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,440
- it's a super uplifting song.
- Yeah.

596
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:26,980
But he ruined it for me.

597
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:28,780
What are you talking about?

598
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,280
All right, so I'm 12 years old,

599
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:31,450
and I join the Glee Club.

600
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,690
Glee Club.

601
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:33,980
All my buddies
in the neighborhood,

602
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,280
they gave me crap over it,

603
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:36,820
but I don't care, because
for the holiday pageant

604
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:38,280
we're doing Do They Know
It's Christmas?,

605
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,870
and I was determined
to land that Bono part.

606
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:45,460
There's a world
outside your window

607
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:49,630
And it's a world
of dread and fear

608
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:53,460
Where the only
water flowing is...

609
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,960
So my buddy Derrick Lindmeyer

610
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,550
is laying into the Sting part,

611
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:59,270
when out in the audience,
what do I see?

612
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:02,180
My dad giving Scotty Kimball's
mom a foot rub,

613
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:03,480
not even paying attention!

614
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,730
I totally missed the Bono part,

615
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,360
and everybody made fun of me.

616
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:18,900
And there won't be
snow in Africa

617
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,280
this Christmastime...

618
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,080
I got no recollection of that.

619
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,160
Yeah, well, I do, all right?

620
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,710
And I got a lot of
other stories just like it.

621
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,870
Science Fair, you left with

622
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,080
Brian Higby's mom.

623
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:29,660
Little League regionals, you
left with Mark Fitzgerald's

624
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,920
mom and his aunt!

625
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:32,930
Oh, yeah, now that I remember.

626
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,590
Yeah, yeah.
That went into extra innings.

627
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,840
Know what I mean, kid?

628
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:37,350
- No.
- Ah.

629
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:38,890
Nice.

630
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,060
Dusty! Dusty! Come on.

631
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:47,570
He's gonna ruin Christmas,
Brad, I'm telling you.

632
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:49,820
Look, I hate to hit
you with the tough love,

633
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:52,230
but the only person
who can ruin your Christmas

634
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:55,570
is looking back at you
from that mirror.

635
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:58,990
- All I see is you, Brad.
- Oh.

636
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:01,080
Okay. Well, sorry. Here. Here.

637
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:03,320
There. There we go.

638
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,450
- Still you, Brad.
- Is it?

639
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:06,710
- Yeah, it's still you.
- Oh.

640
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,670
Okay, well, look, I'm looking
at you, so I meant you.

641
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,210
Well, I'm looking at you,
so I see you.

642
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,340
Forget the mirror.

643
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:14,340
You're the only one
who can ruin your Christmas.

644
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:15,500
Don't look at the mirror!

645
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,010
I'm still looking at you
if I look in the mirror.

646
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,300
Don't worry about the mirror.
That was bad.

647
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:20,680
- Forget the mirror exists.
- Okay.

648
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,720
Let's just focus on those kids

649
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:24,640
and giving them a better
childhood than you had.

650
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:27,650
- You're right.
- Yeah?

651
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:28,720
It's about them.

652
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,900
It's about giving them
a better Christmas.

653
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:31,020
There you go.

654
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,100
Yeah, and then we jam
that amazing Christmas

655
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,190
right in his butthole!

656
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,320
Yes, we do.
Wait! Whoa, whoa! No.

657
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:36,480
Yes!

658
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:38,980
You know, Dusty, I'm, uh, just
gonna take the mirror down.

659
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,690
Then we don't have to
worry about it.

660
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:44,360
Yeah!

661
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:46,660
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

662
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,660
Hey, where's your glove?

663
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,210
No! Griffy!

664
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,670
Excuse me.

665
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,470
Griffy!

666
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,380
Griffy! Hey!

667
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,560
Griffy!

668
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,550
Griffy!

669
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,890
Watch out, honey!

670
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,980
Is that Brad?

671
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,570
- That's Brad!
- That's Brad.

672
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,740
That boy never...

673
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,490
Hey, come here. Look at this.

674
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:34,830
Mmm. Honey.

675
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:37,420
- Oh.
- Ow!

676
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:41,340
Dusty, you like that, huh?

677
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,140
Let me capture this
for posterity.

678
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,480
The Nativity
is a big deal in Terre Haute.

679
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:55,390
This is the Redeemer,
this is Abundant Life.

680
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:56,480
Dad.

681
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:59,280
Let's go, Pop-Pop.

682
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,150
- It's real pretty.
- We'll take the pretty gun.

683
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:08,460
No. No, no, no, no.

684
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,120
We're not gonna take that today

685
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:12,170
'cause we are a gun-free family.

686
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:15,330
Good Lord. What has he
turned you into?

687
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,350
- Ahh!
- Ha-ha!

688
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,840
All right, throw it down!

689
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,010
All right,
here it comes, Braddie!

690
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,770
Brad!

691
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,320
Hey, honey!

692
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,990
Brad! Brad!

693
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:48,540
You need a hat.
You're gonna freeze, babe.

694
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,110
Oh, thanks, sweetie.

695
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,740
You look cute.

696
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,580
Hey, I want to talk to you.
I'm worried about your dad.

697
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:56,540
Don't you think he seems

698
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:58,090
slightly less chatty
than normal?

699
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,590
You got to be shitting me.

700
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,670
I mean, he shows up here
without your mom?

701
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:05,010
Don't you think that's weird?
There might be a problem?

702
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,390
With my mom
and dad's relationship?

703
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:07,510
Yeah!

704
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,270
What? They love each other
more than we do!

705
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,690
Yeah.

706
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,230
I brought you your hat!

707
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:15,350
No, honey,
I didn't mean it that way.

708
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,230
It's a huge compliment.
Come on.

709
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,360
You got to understand.

710
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,270
Brad! The Christmas lights!

711
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:23,570
No, no, no, no.

712
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:25,690
All the light strands
are connected.

713
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,200
A terrible idea!

714
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,540
None of these switches work!

715
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,540
Heads up.

716
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,250
Dad! What are
these levers for?

717
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,540
Ow!

718
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:42,250
- Sara!
- Stand clear!

719
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,010
Brad!

720
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,470
Brad, let it go!

721
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,020
I don't want it to hit your car.

722
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:54,350
Let it go!

723
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,900
- Tell him to let it go.
- Let it go!

724
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,450
Are you all right?

725
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,660
Look what you did
to the side of my car, man.

726
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,000
Dusty, I'm so sorry.

727
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,170
Honey!

728
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:29,420
I'm not putting that
Santy Claus back up there.

729
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,930
I don't want to put it back
on the roof, either.

730
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,390
Why didn't he let go?

731
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:36,890
Because he's an idiot!

732
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,910
Son of a...

733
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,330
Don.

734
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:01,160
Don.

735
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,170
Don, wake up. Don!

736
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,050
Don, wake up! Don! Don!

737
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:12,170
Kurt, are you okay?
Did you have a bad dream?

738
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:13,770
Do you need to talk?

739
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:16,270
Yeah, I need to be held.
My heart hurts. No!

740
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,940
Did you touch the thermostat?
Did you turn it up?

741
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,520
Well, of course not.

742
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:22,230
Did somebody fiddle
with the thermostat?

743
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,360
Yes! It's 85 degrees.

744
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,990
85! Do you have any idea
how much

745
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:28,030
even a few degrees
can impact the gas bill?

746
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,910
Of course I do!
It's unthinkable.

747
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,660
Dad? Kurt?
What's going on in here?

748
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:34,070
Why is it so hot?

749
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,780
Someone fiddled
with the thermostat!

750
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,120
What? Who would do that?

751
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:47,170
What do you think you're doing?

752
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:48,720
It's roasting in here!

753
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,840
I like to sleep
with my window open.

754
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:52,000
Hey, kid.

755
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,710
Are you allowed
to touch the thermostat

756
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:54,890
at your mom's house?

757
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,850
Duh.

758
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,350
What is going on?

759
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,020
Adrianna! She turned up
the thermostat!

760
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:06,060
Said she fiddles with
the thermostat at your place

761
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:07,690
any time she damn well pleases.

762
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:10,400
Dusty, is that true?
Tell me that's not true.

763
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,120
Oh, criminy, Dusty!

764
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:14,620
You might as well
give her your wallet

765
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,040
and your 401 while you're at it!

766
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,200
Brad, do you let the kids

767
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:18,410
touch the thermostat
at your house?

768
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,830
What? No! The thermostat
is a sacred covenant.

769
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,370
I can't believe
we're even talking about this!

770
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,630
This is madness!

771
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,760
Oh, God, even Brad's got
his house in order.

772
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,260
Hey, you got no right
to talk, all right?

773
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:31,040
It wasn't hard to keep me away
from the thermostat

774
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,340
once you shipped me off
to military school.

775
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:33,500
Kurt, you didn't.

776
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,680
He was out of control.
He was a bedwetter.

777
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:36,590
I was a bedwetter.
Were you a bedwetter?

778
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,930
I was four years old!

779
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,720
Okay, everyone take it easy.

780
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,400
It's not Dusty's fault

781
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,940
that he lets Adrianna
walk all over him.

782
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,970
She does not walk all over me!

783
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:46,890
I can see how being a stepdad,

784
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:49,440
you might not feel
empowered to discipline

785
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:51,020
someone else's child.

786
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,780
Hey, quit your scoffing,
all right?

787
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,610
And you two quit helping me.

788
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:58,120
Look, Karen and Roger
spoil her to no end.

789
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,250
It's crazy!

790
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,200
And there's nothing
you can do. I get it!

791
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:04,580
You're the stepdad.
You're screwed.

792
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,420
That kid's never gonna
respect you

793
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:08,040
unless you bring
the hammer down.

794
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:19,260
What the hell was that, Brad?

795
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:21,510
I know.
He's old school.

796
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,680
I think you handled this
really well, Brad.

797
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:25,610
I'm so proud of the way
you express yourself.

798
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:27,520
Come here.

799
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:29,940
Again? Really?

800
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,110
Good night, Dusty!

801
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,650
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night, Brad.

802
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,720
- Jump! Jump!
- Come on, Griff.

803
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,550
Jumpy, jumpy, jumpy!

804
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,220
Casey's here!

805
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,630
Hey, guys.

806
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,340
Hey.

807
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:05,390
Hey, Dylan, look.
Casey's here.

808
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,520
You want to come French her?

809
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,600
Yeah, you want to go do French
on your girlfriend, Dylan?

810
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,770
Megan! Leave him alone.

811
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:14,200
And where did you learn
"do French"?

812
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:15,700
I'll go talk to him.

813
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,990
Dylan? You okay, buddy?

814
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:26,750
I just... I don't get
the whole girls thing.

815
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:28,080
Oh.

816
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,630
Girls, yeah.
Yeah, that can be tricky.

817
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:32,370
But you know
who'd be really good

818
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:33,670
in explaining that department?

819
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,580
Your dad. Let me go grab him.

820
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,630
No, Brad! I just want to talk
to you about this.

821
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,710
Just you, Brad, please?

822
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:40,880
Me? You sure you don't want
to talk to your dad?

823
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:44,270
Oh, well, girls. Okay.

824
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,440
Huh. Um...

825
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:48,860
All right,
the girl talk. Um...

826
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:51,350
You know, boys have a...

827
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,480
A dingle, right?

828
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:54,810
And girls have a hoo-hoo
or a whim-wham.

829
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:55,940
Brad, I already know
about that stuff.

830
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:57,020
You do?

831
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,110
Yes. From school,
and it's gross.

832
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,190
Perfect!

833
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:01,570
I just want to know
what to do if I, you know,

834
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,080
I like somebody.

835
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,280
Oh. Right, well...

836
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,990
You want to become
her friend first.

837
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,330
You want to be that one
that she confides in,

838
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,210
that she tells you
about all of her problems

839
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,580
with the guys
she's actually dating.

840
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,870
Got it.

841
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:15,420
It's called the Friend Zone.

842
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:18,630
And it's where
we Whitaker men thrive.

843
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:22,010
We're the best in the biz.
Yeah.

844
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:24,350
Here we are in a wild frontier,

845
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,930
full of majestic pines,

846
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,930
and you two numbnuts
are sorting through

847
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:30,480
a bunch of dried twigs
on a Rite Aid parking lot.

848
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:31,650
You just can't go out
on public land

849
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:32,770
and cut down a tree, Dad.

850
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:35,480
Dusty, we are the public.
We own those trees.

851
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:40,450
Oh, I get it. You need to
ask co-dad for permission.

852
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,360
Oh, shut up. I know
what you're trying to do.

853
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,620
What am I doing?

854
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:44,870
Make it look like
I can't make a move

855
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,070
without checking in
with Brad first.

856
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,790
Yeah, that's what I'm doing.
Am I right about that, huh?

857
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,830
Oh, God.

858
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:57,170
And we own the paint
in the Friend Zone.

859
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,670
And sure we're gonna
lose some. Doesn't matter.

860
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:01,510
We're gonna lose a lot,
I'll be frank with you.

861
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,090
Well, what do you know?

862
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,850
Brad's having that
nitty-gritty talk for you.

863
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:07,640
Must be nice to have someone

864
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,190
to handle the tough stuff, huh?

865
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,510
And eventually
you'll keep in touch.

866
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:13,680
You might even be invited to
their wedding!

867
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:16,230
And their dad's like, "Brad,
what are you doing here?

868
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,440
"Teresa never talks
about you!"

869
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,410
And you're like,
"I'm invited."

870
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:22,610
And he's like,
"I wonder about that."

871
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:24,450
And you show them the proof!

872
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,200
Always bring
the wedding invite with you.

873
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,490
- Then they can't kick you out.
- Okay.

874
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:29,750
But you'll be sad ultimately

875
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:32,080
knowing that she's not
with you, and

876
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,540
you want to prepare yourself

877
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:35,540
with, like,
a mixtape of sad songs.

878
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,590
Anything from Chicago
is usually pretty good.

879
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:41,300
If you leave me now

880
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,760
You take away
the biggest part of me

881
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,310
I don't really know that song.

882
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:51,730
Ooh-wee, no, baby,
please don't go

883
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,690
Wait! No, no, no! Dylan,

884
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,060
that is the worst advice
anyone could give you.

885
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,440
Listen to your dad, please.

886
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,820
It's okay, Dad.

887
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,190
We don't have to talk about it.

888
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:03,200
No, no, buddy, buddy,
wait, wait, look!

889
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:04,780
Hey, this stuff
is all about confidence.

890
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:06,030
You just got to believe
you're the best

891
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,200
she's ever gonna find.

892
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,500
You believe that to your core,

893
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,040
and she will, too,
I promise you.

894
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:11,290
But what if she doesn't?

895
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,490
Whoa, buddy, you can't be
afraid of rejection.

896
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:15,130
You'll never find love
if you're too scared

897
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:16,500
to put yourself out there.

898
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,000
Hey, Goggles?

899
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:19,290
Mistletoe is your ticket.

900
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,470
You walk right up to her,

901
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,840
you dangle this over her head,

902
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:23,050
and then you slap

903
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,420
your spaghetti suckers
right on her.

904
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,840
I don't know
if that's appropriate.

905
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,430
It's a time-honored
holiday tradition,

906
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,630
Mr. War-On-Christmas.

907
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,060
Then you give her a nice smack
on the caboose

908
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,760
and tell her
what a lucky girl she is.

909
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:33,850
Don't listen
to that part, all right?

910
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,020
Yeah, don't listen to that part.

911
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:36,180
Look at me. Look at me.

912
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,650
You want to be like Brad
and be in the Friend Zone,

913
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,020
or you wanna be like Dad
and get in the end zone?

914
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,730
This worked for me
when I was your age.

915
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:41,860
You want to go for it, buddy?

916
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,160
Come on, you can do this.

917
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:50,490
A love like ours
is love that's hard to find

918
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:56,740
How could we let it slip away?

919
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:59,340
No! I like Brad's way more.

920
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:02,500
I just want to be her friend
and listen to her problems!

921
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:12,560
My tree, my tree,
my tree, my tree.

922
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,220
My tree, my tree.

923
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:15,300
Can I yell "Timber"?

924
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,260
- Sure can, sweetheart.
- Yay!

925
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,520
Is this okay?

926
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:21,020
Are any of these trees
even gonna fit in the cabin?

927
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,810
We're gonna cut off
the top 25 feet

928
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:24,900
and chop the rest up
for firewood, Don.

929
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:26,110
Oh.

930
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,160
Now, this is
the Duster Buster I remember.

931
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,610
A certified badass that makes
his own rules! Whoa.

932
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,120
Go find a good tree, would you?

933
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,700
Boy, I don't know
about this, Kurt.

934
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,130
Isn't it illegal to harvest
a tree from public lands?

935
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,420
Oh, hell, yeah.
It's a federal crime.

936
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:43,750
I tried to talk him out of it,

937
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,760
but you know how stubborn
that kid can be.

938
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:46,840
Okay.

939
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:49,550
Dusty, look, I know
you're upset about Dylan,

940
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,680
but I just...

941
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:52,550
I told you, Brad,
I'm not upset, all right?

942
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,850
We're co-dads!

943
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,430
If he prefers
your terrible advice,

944
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,600
fine, I'm cool with that.

945
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:57,810
I just want to find the perfect

946
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,940
Together Christmas tree.

947
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,020
Well, I just don't know if

948
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,150
it's the best choice, you know?

949
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,480
Well, maybe we're not always
gonna do

950
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:04,400
everything your way every time.

951
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,030
Trouble in paradise, fellas?

952
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,190
- No, we're picking a tree.
- Just having a conversation.

953
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,030
El Padre!

954
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:12,440
Lookit!

955
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:14,610
Hey, what, kids? What,
you find a dead squirrel?

956
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,830
We don't have
to do things my way.

957
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,950
- Really?
- Yeah.

958
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,030
What about baseball snack?

959
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,490
I just wanted to give out
Fruit Roll-Ups,

960
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:21,620
and what's the big deal?

961
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,960
No, I just feel like organic
fruit is much more nutritious

962
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:25,420
than its rolled-up counterpart.

963
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:26,580
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

964
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,760
And what about Megan's diorama?

965
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:28,840
You didn't want to use
any of my ideas.

966
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,720
Your only idea
was the Bay of Pigs!

967
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:31,880
But it's an important event

968
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:33,060
- in our nation's history!
- It was bloody.

969
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,510
You wanted her to do
green energy

970
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,140
so you could look
like Mr. Perfect Dad.

971
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:38,550
- I'm not Mr. Perfect Dad.
- You act like Mr. Perfect Dad.

972
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:39,810
I'm not Mr. Perfect Dad.

973
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,060
And we don't
have to do things my way.

974
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,650
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

975
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,740
Okay. You don't think I can
operate a chainsaw, do you?

976
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:50,570
Guess who got his woodlands
management badge in Webelos.

977
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:52,900
I did! Brad Whitaker.

978
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,490
Ah!

979
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:59,660
Dusty, look at this one.
Perfectly symmetrical.

980
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,120
Okay.

981
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:05,840
Oh, yeah.

982
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:08,000
Keep an eye out for rangers!

983
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:11,550
I've got to pinpoint
a 60 degree angle top cut.

984
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:14,470
That's what I'm gonna do first.

985
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:18,140
Oh, yeah!
She's cutting like butter!

986
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,100
Hey, Brad, isn't that a...

987
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,480
Hold it, hold it!

988
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,030
Timber!

989
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:39,040
Wow!

990
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,160
Brad, you cut down
a cell phone tower.

991
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:43,710
Why'd you cut down
a cell phone tower?

992
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,500
No bars? No bars?

993
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,210
- That was excellent!
- Get up.

994
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:51,380
You really stuck
that landing, man.

995
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:52,460
Would you get up?

996
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,050
I'd give you a 9.2
on my card.

997
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,130
Brad, get up.

998
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:56,300
I think Brad's dead again.

999
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:58,100
Oh, man,
you killed the poor bastard!

1000
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,180
Brad, don't go into the light!

1001
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:02,520
It's okay, sweetheart.
El Padre will bring him back.

1002
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:04,020
- Stand clear.
- I got it, all right?

1003
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,390
It's your fault
we're even out here.

1004
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,570
You're getting in our heads

1005
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:07,640
and starting static
between me and Brad.

1006
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,100
There's plenty of static

1007
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,650
between you and Brad already.

1008
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:11,810
And you know what?
Deep down,

1009
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,400
you want him dead, don't you?

1010
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,570
You can say it.

1011
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:15,900
We all want him dead.
I want him dead.

1012
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,240
- Everybody does.
- What?

1013
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,490
Come on, admit it.

1014
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,700
Why don't you admit why you
invited yourself to Christmas?

1015
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,330
Oh, well, why don't you
tell me, smart guy?

1016
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,040
'Cause you knew I was back
here trying to be a good dad,

1017
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,840
be around for my kids
the way you never were for me.

1018
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,710
That's why you want
to crap all over it.

1019
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,000
Get up, Brad!

1020
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,170
Oh, my God, what happened?

1021
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:34,010
You cut down
a cell phone tower, Brad.

1022
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,670
You know, you're right.

1023
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:37,100
I did invite myself
to Christmas.

1024
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:39,550
But that's because you never do.

1025
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:44,510
I feel like I died again.
Did I die again?

1026
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:46,020
A little bit. Come on.

1027
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:51,560
Okay.
Our report's all squared away.

1028
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,450
Yimmy, Bill,
thank you guys so much

1029
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:54,740
for the understanding.
We really appreciate it.

1030
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:57,070
I'm so sorry.
I'm truly embarrassed.

1031
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,360
No, hey.
It was an honest mistake.

1032
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,490
Okay, you're all set.

1033
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,360
Okay, we'd better
get back to the site

1034
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,490
and lock it down.

1035
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:06,000
Hold on one second.

1036
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:09,300
Is there any way we could
do better than $20,000?

1037
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:11,800
Can't you reuse some
of the antenna equipment?

1038
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:15,670
Sorry, no. These old 4G units
are obsolete already.

1039
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:17,510
That's why you're getting
this one so cheap!

1040
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,760
It looks really nice, though.

1041
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:20,340
It sure does.
Hey, guys, keep it up,

1042
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:22,020
it looks great.
Happy Holidays.

1043
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:23,680
Happy Christmas, guys. Thanks.

1044
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:25,190
Please tell me
you did not just spend

1045
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:26,930
$20,000 on a Christmas tree?

1046
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:29,860
$20,000.
"Can you hear me now?"

1047
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:32,320
You want some eggnog?

1048
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:36,740
- Mmm, yummy.
- Hey!

1049
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:38,730
- I want some!
- Me, too!

1050
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:40,400
Now, girls,
that's a grown-up drink.

1051
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,330
Yes. Thank you, Karen.

1052
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,200
So we're only gonna have one.

1053
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:45,320
What? No, no, no!

1054
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,490
There's rum in there,
so not any.

1055
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:49,040
Aw!

1056
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,960
Are you writing about me?

1057
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:53,510
All right.
Somebody want to plug her in?

1058
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:55,250
Yeah, I got it.

1059
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:57,880
Cool!

1060
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,470
That's weird.

1061
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,930
Wow!

1062
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:21,370
What do you think?

1063
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,120
It's so pretty.

1064
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:26,870
Well, it ought to be
at 1,200 bucks a foot.

1065
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,040
Dad, we're lighting the tree!

1066
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,710
- Where's my dad?
- Yeah, I thought it was

1067
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,000
a little quiet around here.

1068
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:34,370
- Pop-Pop? Pop-Pop?
- Don?

1069
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:37,960
Is he still outside?

1070
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,210
Dad!

1071
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,810
Dad?

1072
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:46,930
Dad?

1073
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:48,980
Brad!

1074
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,980
Dad! Where are you?

1075
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:53,270
- I found him! Where are you?
- I don't know.

1076
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:55,150
- Are you hurt?
- Oh, no, no!

1077
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,950
No, I just can't quite get up.

1078
00:42:58,530 --> 00:42:59,610
Oh!

1079
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:01,230
Dad, don't move.

1080
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:02,530
There's a pack of wolves on you.

1081
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,910
- Oh, is that what it is?
- Yeah.

1082
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:07,410
I can feel something
tugging at my trousers.

1083
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:10,120
- What color are they, Brad?
- They're gray wolves.

1084
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:12,380
That'll be Canis lupus.
They're dangerous.

1085
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:13,710
Really?
They look like you could

1086
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,830
just reach out and pet them.

1087
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:16,340
I kind of want to pet them, Dad.

1088
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:19,050
Now, Brad. Don't make eye
contact with the alpha wolf.

1089
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:21,340
I already did!
Right in the eyes.

1090
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:23,010
Don't show any fear.

1091
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:25,140
I don't want to watch
the wolves eat you!

1092
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:27,140
Breathe deep
and pull yourself together.

1093
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:28,550
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1094
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:29,720
Hut!

1095
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:33,640
Hut! Hurt!

1096
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:35,650
Are you saying "hut" or "hurt"?

1097
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:36,810
Dad, what happened?

1098
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:39,350
Oh, you know,
I saw the nicest tree

1099
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,660
a ways off, and

1100
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:42,660
I got a little off course.

1101
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:44,440
I tried to call you,
but all of a sudden

1102
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:45,570
my signal dropped!

1103
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:46,650
Really?

1104
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:48,740
I tried to find my way back, but

1105
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,780
at some point
I lost consciousness.

1106
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,040
That's about when the wolves
must have come across me.

1107
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:55,370
It's all right, fellas.

1108
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:57,880
You didn't have to go
to any trouble. It's all good.

1109
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,970
I'm sorry for all the hugs.

1110
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,020
I kind of don't want to let go.

1111
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:10,010
I almost thought
I'd lost you out there

1112
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:11,310
to those nasty wolves.

1113
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,470
Do you have any idea
how much I love you?

1114
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:16,810
Well, of course I do.
You tweet about it every day.

1115
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:19,150
You know how much I love you,
too, don't you?

1116
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:22,060
Your answer is right in here.

1117
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,240
I can see it!

1118
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:27,940
Okay, now that everyone
is accounted for,

1119
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:30,200
can we please talk
about who is paying

1120
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:31,620
for that monstrosity?

1121
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,620
Well, you know, it was Dusty's
idea to cut down the tree.

1122
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,790
Yeah, and it was your idea

1123
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,210
to cut down
the cell phone tower, Brad.

1124
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:39,540
Great, so as per usual
we get stuck paying.

1125
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,960
- Wait, what does that mean?
- I think it's a nice tree.

1126
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:43,880
I don't know. Dylan's
retainer? Megan's flute?

1127
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:45,920
What about Tae Kwon Do
that you signed them up for

1128
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:47,220
and didn't even ask us about?

1129
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:49,720
Yes, and who paid for the trip
to the aquarium last week?

1130
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:51,100
It's a really nice tree.

1131
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:52,180
So now we're keeping score, huh?

1132
00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:53,260
Well, who paid for the parking

1133
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,940
and bought each one of them
a blowup orca?

1134
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:57,060
After we told them they
couldn't have a blowup orca!

1135
00:44:57,190 --> 00:44:58,180
Yeah, because you were too cheap

1136
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,270
to buy them a blowup orca!

1137
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,440
Who crushed my car with
a snow blower? You did, Brad.

1138
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:02,860
Who crushed my car
with a motorcycle?

1139
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:03,980
Hello! You again!

1140
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:05,060
Hey!

1141
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,490
It's a beautiful tree!

1142
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:08,610
It's beautiful, all right?

1143
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:09,990
Okay, yeah.

1144
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,290
Dad's right.

1145
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:13,780
It's a beautiful tree.

1146
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:17,040
Whoa!

1147
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,170
Don, I'm sorry, I don't think

1148
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:20,340
I'm gonna be able
to save the foot.

1149
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:21,500
Yeah, that baby's coming off.

1150
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:23,330
I'll need some morphine
and a bread knife.

1151
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:24,840
Brad, hold him down.

1152
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:27,130
Oh, no.
That's just my feet.

1153
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:29,220
It's the mail carrier's curse.

1154
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:31,630
Back when I used to
sleep with your mom,

1155
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:34,020
I once scratched her leg so bad

1156
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:35,770
with a piece of rogue heel skin,

1157
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:37,600
it actually drew blood.

1158
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:40,020
What do you mean,
used to sleep with Ginny?

1159
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,310
What?

1160
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:45,190
Oh. We sleep
in separate bedrooms.

1161
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:47,780
You know how badly
I snore, Brad.

1162
00:45:48,290 --> 00:45:50,200
Boy, that is inspiring!

1163
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:51,990
You know?
The way you're always

1164
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:54,410
so considerate
to the other person.

1165
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:56,160
Ugh.

1166
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:58,840
I really want
to take this foot off.

1167
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:09,210
Hey, sweetie.

1168
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,050
You know, you might want
to close your window.

1169
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:12,300
You know, since it's winter?

1170
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,470
You're not my dad.

1171
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:14,890
You know, I appreciate you
reminding me of that

1172
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:16,220
every few hours.

1173
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,640
But, you know, we're not
the only people here,

1174
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:20,310
so maybe we set
the thermostat to like 75?

1175
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,230
I mean, that's still
really toasty, right?

1176
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,310
85.

1177
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:24,740
Okay, well,

1178
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:26,900
what if I counter you
at like 78?

1179
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:28,190
And then you negotiate
with me, you come back

1180
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,780
at like 83, and then
maybe we settle at like 80.

1181
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:32,330
- What do you say to that?
- 81.

1182
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:33,400
Deal!

1183
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:35,160
Look at that. The two of us
are starting to see

1184
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:36,240
eye to eye.

1185
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:37,660
Thank you, sweetie.

1186
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,040
Oh, thank God.

1187
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:41,370
Oh, there's Brad
with some makeup cocoa

1188
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:43,460
for being such a jerk.
Thank you.

1189
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:46,130
- Brad! What are you doing?
- Oh, God.

1190
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:48,960
Why would you do that?

1191
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:50,040
Look what you made me do!

1192
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:51,210
- I didn't do anything.
- I didn't make you do it!

1193
00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:52,640
I thought you were bringing me
hot makeup cocoa

1194
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:53,890
and you just, like,
threw it all over yourself.

1195
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:55,270
You almost burned me, Brad!

1196
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:56,720
I wasn't bringing you
makeup cocoa.

1197
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:57,980
Why not?

1198
00:46:58,060 --> 00:46:59,220
I would've said, "Here, bud,
some makeup cocoa."

1199
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:00,350
I've been waiting
for my makeup cocoa.

1200
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:01,430
I didn't know that!

1201
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,900
If I knew you wanted
makeup cocoa, I would've...

1202
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,230
81!

1203
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,490
No, no, don't touch that!

1204
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:07,560
I talked her down
from the high 80s.

1205
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:09,320
I'm making progress with her.
This is good.

1206
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:10,650
Oh, I thought you had
your house in order.

1207
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:11,980
Look, don't you see?

1208
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,490
We're doing
exactly what he wants.

1209
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:14,820
We're letting things
out of the harbor!

1210
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:15,950
- So you are harboring.
- Of course I'm harboring!

1211
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,030
And so are you.

1212
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:18,200
Harboring was working just fine

1213
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:19,500
before he showed up.

1214
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,030
Let's get everything
back in the harbor

1215
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:23,420
and let's harbor it all back
in and close up the harbor.

1216
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:24,920
I don't know if I can!

1217
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:26,580
Remember you said let's put
the focus back on the kids?

1218
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,460
That was a great idea!

1219
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:31,550
Fine. Harbor's closed.

1220
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:32,630
Good.

1221
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,460
But we're going halfsies
on the cell tower.

1222
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,140
Fine, halfsies
on the cell tower.

1223
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:38,300
Brad, are you okay?

1224
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:40,300
Yeah.

1225
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,020
- Did you make tee-tee in bed?
- No, it's cocoa.

1226
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:45,020
Did your cocoa
make you tee-tee in bed?

1227
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:46,730
You're sleepwalking.
Go back to sleep.

1228
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:49,280
The big boy doesn't have
to be embarrassed.

1229
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:53,740
How would I pee upwards?

1230
00:47:58,370 --> 00:47:59,710
7½. 13.

1231
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:09,080
- Pretty good.
- Yeah.

1232
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:10,470
Better than before.

1233
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:11,920
Yeah, the skip was really cool.

1234
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:16,050
Hey. Do you mind?
Bowler's etiquette.

1235
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:18,220
- What do you mean?
- It means you're crowding me.

1236
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:20,060
What? You can't bowl
with me here?

1237
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:25,020
That sounded like a strike.

1238
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:32,910
How's your hearing?

1239
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:36,240
- Dylan, come on, you're up!
- All right.

1240
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:38,240
Let's go. Hey, come on.
You can do this, okay?

1241
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:41,620
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What's with the kiddie stuff?

1242
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:43,000
- What? The rails?
- Yeah.

1243
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:44,790
It's how the kids
learn how to bowl, Dad.

1244
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,670
You learn by fearing the gutter.

1245
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:47,870
Like in life, Dusty.

1246
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:50,260
Now, Kurt.
The rails help a young bowler

1247
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:51,880
build a positive self-image.

1248
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:54,130
Dylan, come here.

1249
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:56,720
Do you want to bowl
with those sissy rails up,

1250
00:48:56,810 --> 00:48:59,350
or do you want to stand
and bowl like a man?

1251
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:01,890
I don't need the rails, I guess.

1252
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,140
Attaboy!
I'm proud of you, kid.

1253
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:05,150
Hey, I'm proud of you too,
big guy, all right?

1254
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:07,060
Dylan's going without the rails.

1255
00:49:07,230 --> 00:49:09,650
No rails?
Whoo! All right, Dylan!

1256
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:11,810
Don't be afraid
to release it high.

1257
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:12,900
Here we go.

1258
00:49:14,070 --> 00:49:15,410
Good try.

1259
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:16,870
When he's up there
with the tears

1260
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:18,190
and "I suck at everything"
business,

1261
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:20,030
that's on you,
Mr. School of Hard Knocks.

1262
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:21,620
Hey, better than him
living in your basement

1263
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:23,200
in 20 years, Mr. Sissy Rails.

1264
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:28,870
Come on, buddy.
Give it another shot.

1265
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:30,800
Okay. New start,
new beginning. Here we go.

1266
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:36,920
Yay!

1267
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:39,590
Oh, yeah.

1268
00:49:50,990 --> 00:49:53,480
Are we certain
he understands the game?

1269
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:55,810
He seems to almost be trying
to put it in the gutter.

1270
00:49:55,990 --> 00:49:58,070
I know. He needs to get
more height on the ball.

1271
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,420
I hate this frickin' game!
It's so frickin' stupid!

1272
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:19,630
Hey, everybody, check it out!

1273
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:21,550
This kid's about to bowl
a perfect zero.

1274
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:22,970
Hey, mind your business!

1275
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:25,890
Hey, how do you think
this is gonna make him

1276
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:26,970
feel about himself?

1277
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:28,810
Well,
this is character building.

1278
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:30,470
Even the ridicule.

1279
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:32,680
- Come on, bud.
- Come on, Dylan!

1280
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:34,600
It's okay.

1281
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:36,530
I suck at everything!

1282
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,780
I quit, I quit!

1283
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:42,490
Hey. Hey, kid, listen.

1284
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,920
We Mayron men
might not always show up.

1285
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:49,240
I mean, we want to show up,
we intend to, but

1286
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:51,160
sometimes we get trashed
the night before,

1287
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:52,750
or we wreck a speedboat, or

1288
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,420
hook up with some Emirates
flight attendants and

1289
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:58,340
somehow end up
on a redeye to Dubai.

1290
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:00,550
You know what I mean.

1291
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:02,640
The point is, we may not
always show up,

1292
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:05,470
but when we do,
we finish what we start.

1293
00:51:05,770 --> 00:51:07,850
Now you get up there
and grab those balls.

1294
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:15,310
Come on, you got this.

1295
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:24,540
Go, bro!

1296
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,830
I'll take that.

1297
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:28,660
I'll cover that.

1298
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:32,670
Come on, honey!

1299
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:35,750
- Come on, buddy.
- You can do it, kid.

1300
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,010
Please. Please.

1301
00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:07,290
Whoo! I did it!

1302
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:12,040
Thanks for believing in me,
El Padre!

1303
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:14,870
You bet, buddy!
I knew you had it in you!

1304
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:19,460
You're a winner!
You're a winner!

1305
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:31,640
Hey, where were you guys?

1306
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:32,940
We're almost at the front
of the line here.

1307
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:35,640
We were at the Starbucks
checking out the local talent.

1308
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:37,100
Cute little number
at the next table

1309
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:38,360
was giving this one the eye.

1310
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:40,110
And El Padre got a phone
number from the lady

1311
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:42,940
who made the coffees.
We got free ones!

1312
00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:47,280
- I drink coffee now.
- What? Get in here.

1313
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:48,830
Big jump!

1314
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:55,460
Hey, honey,
are you sure you don't want

1315
00:52:55,550 --> 00:52:56,660
to go see Santa with the boys?

1316
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,250
You were so excited.

1317
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:02,760
Mom, Santa is so lame.

1318
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:05,420
- Come on.
- He can hear you, you know!

1319
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:09,260
You know, I'm sorry, um...

1320
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:13,350
My daughter thinks that
your daughter is amazing.

1321
00:53:13,770 --> 00:53:15,100
Oh, that's sweet.

1322
00:53:16,270 --> 00:53:18,270
Which is cute, you're right, but

1323
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:20,860
sometimes when Adrianna
does certain things,

1324
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:22,440
then Megan thinks
that it's okay to do it

1325
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:23,770
because you said that...

1326
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:30,110
Oh, my God.

1327
00:53:30,830 --> 00:53:32,490
Are you really
stealing right now?

1328
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:34,370
Sometimes I shoplift
a little bit.

1329
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:35,670
It's exciting!

1330
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:39,500
No! I mean... Okay, yeah,
it's a little exciting.

1331
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:41,170
My heart's really
beating out of my chest.

1332
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:43,420
What if we get caught?
You got to put it back!

1333
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:44,630
You're so obedient.

1334
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,340
You're always following
the rules, you know.

1335
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:47,590
Come on, Sara.

1336
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,170
Have a little fun with me.
Relax.

1337
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:51,180
I mean, I would love
to have a little fun with you,

1338
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:53,680
but I just want you to know,
I am not obedient, okay?

1339
00:53:53,850 --> 00:53:56,310
- Then put this in your pants.
- Uh, no. No, thank you.

1340
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,470
And don't touch my boobs.
It's weird.

1341
00:53:58,650 --> 00:54:01,060
Stop it!
I'm not going to shoplift!

1342
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,650
- Why not?
- Because...

1343
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:05,110
Because you're about to see why.

1344
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,770
- Pardon me, miss?
- Yes?

1345
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:09,080
- Is this woman bothering you?
- What?

1346
00:54:09,370 --> 00:54:12,530
She's a little judgmental,
but she's fine. Thank you.

1347
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:14,240
No worries.

1348
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:23,630
Welcome to the North Pole!

1349
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,590
And what do you want
for Christmas?

1350
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,470
Oh, I didn't miss it. Hi!

1351
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:35,640
Right there.
This is a great shot.

1352
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:38,220
- Are you getting it, honey?
- Yeah, I got a good one.

1353
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,560
That's a great shot.

1354
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,310
Thank you, Santa.

1355
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:42,480
- Oh, you're welcome!
- Hi, honey.

1356
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:44,400
What about you, big brother?

1357
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:46,610
I'm sure you've been good.
What's on your list?

1358
00:54:46,910 --> 00:54:48,650
I kind of want

1359
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:50,360
a 20-gauge shotgun,

1360
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:52,190
so I can go turkey hunting
with my El Padre!

1361
00:54:52,370 --> 00:54:53,860
What the heck?
Where'd he come up with that?

1362
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,040
Did he just ask for a firearm?

1363
00:54:55,210 --> 00:54:57,290
Sure did! 20-gauge.
Kid knows his guns.

1364
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,170
Kurt, we've already been
through this. Dusty and I...

1365
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:00,870
Yeah, it is final. That's it.
It's not happening.

1366
00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:02,160
Really?
Because I don't remember

1367
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:03,370
being part of that discussion.

1368
00:55:03,630 --> 00:55:05,420
Or am I just some
little obedient wife

1369
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:06,720
who does whatever
the men folk say?

1370
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:08,720
Yeah, that doesn't
seem quite fair to me.

1371
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:09,790
Oh, piss off, Kurt.

1372
00:55:09,970 --> 00:55:11,460
Honey, he's talking about a gun.

1373
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:14,300
If I may, can I just

1374
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:17,310
have a word with my grandson?

1375
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:20,180
I just want you
to fully understand

1376
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:21,640
what you're asking for.

1377
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:24,900
To take a gun
into the wilderness,

1378
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:27,780
find an animal living free,

1379
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:29,910
and take away its life.

1380
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,990
So that it can never
breathe or run

1381
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:35,400
or play ever again. Now,

1382
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:37,740
is that what you really want?

1383
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,120
Yes.

1384
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:42,130
- No. I don't want to do that.
- Ah.

1385
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:44,040
You have a good heart, Dylan.

1386
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:45,960
I'll do it!
I'll kill a turkey!

1387
00:55:46,130 --> 00:55:47,790
Can I shoot one? Please?

1388
00:55:49,090 --> 00:55:51,090
I'll have one shotgun,
please, Santa.

1389
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:52,840
And gobs and gobs of bullets.

1390
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:55,220
No, no, no, cupcake.
No, I'm sorry.

1391
00:55:55,390 --> 00:55:59,060
No, the men do the hunting.
You ladies cook what we kill.

1392
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,510
Excuse me?

1393
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:03,890
Yeah, excuse you?

1394
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:06,150
Here, turkey, turkey, turkey!

1395
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:07,440
Be patient, sweetheart.

1396
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:08,740
The decoys are right
around the corner.

1397
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:10,110
This is nice, huh, Dust?

1398
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,820
You and me, the fresh air.
Just like old times.

1399
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:14,150
What do you mean
"just like old times"?

1400
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,330
You only took me once, Dad.

1401
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:16,610
Aw, jeez, I don't know.
Are you sure

1402
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:18,450
this is a good idea, Sara?

1403
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:20,710
Megan is a strong
independent woman.

1404
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,910
If she wants to help thin
the wild turkey population

1405
00:56:23,090 --> 00:56:24,950
so that they don't starve
to death in the winter,

1406
00:56:25,130 --> 00:56:26,710
that is her right
by the Second Amendment.

1407
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,710
Boy, you bought into that
real quick.

1408
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:29,920
I mean, I think for Megan

1409
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:31,420
this is less
about wildlife conservation

1410
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:32,630
and more about bloodlust.

1411
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,470
Looks like somebody picked
the wrong day to be a turkey.

1412
00:56:35,890 --> 00:56:38,300
Keep your elbow down
and cradle the stock, okay.

1413
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,470
Yeah, I get it.

1414
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:41,050
Can I shoot
the damn thing or not?

1415
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:42,560
Yeah, that's the spirit.

1416
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,390
Take a deep breath,

1417
00:56:44,650 --> 00:56:45,690
and then squeeze that trigger

1418
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:47,730
as you're letting it out.

1419
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:50,820
Megan, are you sure
this is what you want to do?

1420
00:56:51,990 --> 00:56:52,980
Let's name it.

1421
00:56:53,070 --> 00:56:54,490
She's not gonna kill it
if it has a name.

1422
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:56,820
- Yes! Uh... Gertrude.
- Sam? Tom?

1423
00:56:57,290 --> 00:56:58,620
Billie Holiday! No.

1424
00:56:58,790 --> 00:56:59,870
- Elijah.
- Elijah!

1425
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:01,820
- Elijah, run home!
- Stand your ground, kid.

1426
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:02,910
Save yourself, Elijah!

1427
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,030
Take the shot, kid.
Take the shot.

1428
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:05,330
No, Elijah has feelings!

1429
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:06,630
Take the shot!

1430
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:09,620
Oh, God!

1431
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:11,080
Dad!

1432
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:13,380
Oh, my God.
Honey, are you okay?

1433
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:14,630
- Kurt!
- Dad, Dad, are you all right?

1434
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:15,960
I'm okay. She just winged me.

1435
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:17,470
I'm sorry, El Padre!
I'm sorry.

1436
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:18,630
That's okay, kid.
I've been shot

1437
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:20,140
worse than this plenty of times.

1438
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:21,640
Make your scarf
into a tourniquet.

1439
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:23,390
Wrap it around his shoulder.

1440
00:57:23,730 --> 00:57:25,220
Lift his legs!

1441
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,310
- You'll be fine, sweetheart.
- I'm gonna bleed out.

1442
00:57:34,950 --> 00:57:35,940
Wow.

1443
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:38,730
Two for two.
Makes getting shot worth it.

1444
00:57:38,910 --> 00:57:40,240
Get the birds, Brad.

1445
00:57:40,410 --> 00:57:42,580
God! I don't know
who this child is.

1446
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:44,080
You get that one.

1447
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:53,960
What? I know, okay?

1448
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:56,420
It's on me. I'm the worst mom
in the world.

1449
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:58,010
I put a gun
in my daughter's hand,

1450
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:00,090
and then
she nearly killed somebody.

1451
00:58:00,430 --> 00:58:02,520
She's gonna be scarred for life.

1452
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:04,180
Hi!

1453
00:58:04,350 --> 00:58:05,640
I just shot a turkey and a man.

1454
00:58:06,310 --> 00:58:07,980
Guess which one's dead.

1455
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:15,650
Okay, fine, maybe
she's a little too unscarred.

1456
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:16,780
Jeez.

1457
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:23,330
- You all right?
- Yeah, good.

1458
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:24,660
All right. So, listen,

1459
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:25,830
the doctor said everything is
gonna be all right.

1460
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,620
He just wants to keep you
for a couple of hours

1461
00:58:27,710 --> 00:58:28,830
to watch your blood pressure.

1462
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,670
I'm fine. Where's my pants?

1463
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,670
Hey. Oh, I forgot.
Nothing ever hurts you.

1464
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:34,080
Why don't we just round up
all the nurses?

1465
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:35,170
We can bring them in here.

1466
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:36,300
You could do some pushups
for them,

1467
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:37,460
maybe bench press
the couch a little bit,

1468
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:38,720
prove you're still a tough guy.

1469
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:40,260
Still tough enough
to lick you, Junior.

1470
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:41,340
Was that a scoff?

1471
00:58:41,470 --> 00:58:42,460
I didn't scoff.

1472
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:43,640
Yeah, I heard you scoff
just then.

1473
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:44,760
All right, I scoffed. So what?

1474
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:46,270
Why, because you think
you can lick me, right?

1475
00:58:46,350 --> 00:58:47,340
Oh, I never said
I could lick you,

1476
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,430
but I could whoop you for sure.

1477
00:58:48,610 --> 00:58:49,600
Oh, now we're talking!

1478
00:58:49,690 --> 00:58:50,850
Come on. Best out of
three falls, come on.

1479
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:52,520
Hey, cut it out, okay? I'm not
gonna wrestle an old man

1480
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:54,070
whose ass is hanging out
of his hospital gown.

1481
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,730
Greco-Roman style. Best way.
Come on.

1482
00:58:55,910 --> 00:58:57,900
Hey, Great Santini, I'm not
gonna do this, all right?

1483
00:58:58,070 --> 00:58:59,690
- Cut it out. Get some rest.
- All right.

1484
00:58:59,950 --> 00:59:01,440
Hey!

1485
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:03,540
That's one, candy-ass.

1486
00:59:03,710 --> 00:59:05,200
Oh, now you're gonna
get whipped, old man.

1487
00:59:05,290 --> 00:59:06,370
Come on. Bring it on.

1488
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:12,620
Tap out!

1489
00:59:12,710 --> 00:59:14,250
Nah. I can keep going
all night, kid.

1490
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:16,050
You hear that heart rate?
You can set your watch to it.

1491
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:18,130
Oh, yeah. 'Cause ice water
only flows at one speed, huh?

1492
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:20,300
That's right, pal.
Now go to sleep.

1493
00:59:20,470 --> 00:59:21,550
You know I came in to
say something nice,

1494
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:22,680
but now you can forget it.

1495
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:24,430
Huh. What nice thing?

1496
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:25,930
No. Forget it.

1497
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:28,140
You know,
when that gun went off,

1498
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:29,270
I thought you were a goner.

1499
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:30,520
There's something that
we never say that

1500
00:59:30,610 --> 00:59:32,820
one of us should say
before it's too late.

1501
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:36,110
Yeah? Like... Like what?

1502
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:37,320
No, I'm not gonna say it now,

1503
00:59:37,410 --> 00:59:38,990
but maybe
you want to say something.

1504
00:59:39,070 --> 00:59:40,060
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1505
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,190
Oh, yeah?

1506
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,530
Seems like you might want to
get something off your chest.

1507
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:44,690
No. Nothing comes to mind.

1508
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:46,030
But if you want to
say something,

1509
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:47,280
I'm not gonna stop you
or anything.

1510
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:48,490
No, I'm good.

1511
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:49,700
But you might wanna
unburden yourself

1512
00:59:49,790 --> 00:59:51,580
before you bust that
frickin' machine.

1513
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,250
Yeah. Well, if I was gonna say
something, and I'm not...

1514
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:55,410
What are you gonna say?

1515
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:57,040
But if I was, I might want to
tell you that I...

1516
00:59:57,220 --> 00:59:58,250
Hello?

1517
00:59:58,340 --> 00:59:59,420
Wait, it's Brad! Don't,
don't say it! Don't say it.

1518
00:59:59,510 --> 01:00:00,500
Knock, knock!

1519
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:01,590
Time out on three,
okay? One, two, three.

1520
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:02,920
Hey, Brad.

1521
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:04,600
What's going on?

1522
01:00:04,770 --> 01:00:06,340
Hey.
Am I interrupting something?

1523
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:07,930
- What? No, nothing.
- No, we're fine.

1524
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:09,260
Why are you being so weird,
Brad?

1525
01:00:09,350 --> 01:00:10,440
Just seems
a little awkward in here.

1526
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:13,560
Oh, gosh.
It smells like a bullfight.

1527
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:15,390
So, look, guys,

1528
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:17,600
I'm not here to tell you
I told you so,

1529
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:18,730
even though I did.

1530
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:20,980
I've just been thinking that

1531
01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:23,360
we've had a lot of tensions
as of late, and I thought

1532
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:26,030
maybe we could use
a Dads' Night Out. Right?

1533
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:28,450
Yeah.
So what are we thinking, Brad?

1534
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:29,580
Strip club?

1535
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:31,910
Even better.

1536
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:35,750
Oh, look, it's a cute
tiny monkey on your back.

1537
01:00:40,090 --> 01:00:41,300
Give us all the money
in the drawers

1538
01:00:41,390 --> 01:00:42,880
and all the lollipops.

1539
01:00:46,890 --> 01:00:48,470
Guys, I can't keep up.

1540
01:00:58,110 --> 01:00:59,100
I'm gonna hit the head.

1541
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,230
I'll get us
a couple more drinks.

1542
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:01,310
Sure.

1543
01:01:01,410 --> 01:01:03,740
Hey, am I crazy or are
you guys having a good time?

1544
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:05,370
I don't know.
I think we kind of are.

1545
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:07,480
- That's wonderful, Dusty!
- Thanks, Don.

1546
01:01:08,370 --> 01:01:10,160
I told you
we'd rub off on you two.

1547
01:01:10,330 --> 01:01:11,870
In this room right now,

1548
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:15,170
uh, there's a man who,
despite his advancing years,

1549
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:17,500
is apparently an improv ninja.

1550
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:19,590
Brad, you didn't.

1551
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,420
I did. I so did!

1552
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:24,590
Don Whitaker,
ladies and gentlemen!

1553
01:01:24,930 --> 01:01:27,090
All right. All right.

1554
01:01:29,850 --> 01:01:31,260
You are the greatest.

1555
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:35,430
Don!
Let's hear it for Don!

1556
01:01:36,270 --> 01:01:37,640
We're gonna play
a little "Arms Akimbo."

1557
01:01:37,730 --> 01:01:38,770
Do you know that one?

1558
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:40,020
- Oh! Of course I do!
- Awesome.

1559
01:01:40,110 --> 01:01:41,150
They're gonna love this.

1560
01:01:41,530 --> 01:01:44,110
- Can somebody do my Velcro?
- Yes.

1561
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:46,280
He's got tiny little girl arms!

1562
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:49,620
Okay.
We're gonna do a scene,

1563
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:51,620
and we need some suggestions.

1564
01:01:51,710 --> 01:01:53,160
Can you suggest an animal?

1565
01:01:53,330 --> 01:01:54,670
- Raccoon!
- A panda!

1566
01:01:54,830 --> 01:01:56,580
Raccoon, good! All right.

1567
01:01:56,670 --> 01:01:58,500
And, sir,
what is your profession?

1568
01:01:58,670 --> 01:02:00,000
I'm a dermatologist.

1569
01:02:00,170 --> 01:02:03,010
And finally
we need a human relationship.

1570
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:04,260
Oh! Father and son!

1571
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:05,930
A healthy father
and son relationship.

1572
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:07,630
Or how about a divorce?

1573
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:10,880
Oh. Now you're getting
in the spirit, Dusty.

1574
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:12,180
Yes. Okay.
We're taking "divorce."

1575
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:13,430
That's all we need.
Give it up!

1576
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:15,220
That's really dark.

1577
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:17,020
Oh, come on, babe.

1578
01:02:17,110 --> 01:02:18,640
Just a little fun
before he gets here.

1579
01:02:18,820 --> 01:02:20,020
No. Stop it. I told you, okay?

1580
01:02:20,110 --> 01:02:22,570
No canoodling until
the divorce is finalized.

1581
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:24,320
- It's not right.
- Oh, come on.

1582
01:02:24,570 --> 01:02:25,940
Knock, knock.

1583
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:29,080
He has no idea
what he's walking into!

1584
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,650
Oh, you're home!

1585
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:32,990
Yes.

1586
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:35,200
Where were you?

1587
01:02:36,830 --> 01:02:39,830
Uh... I took our raccoon
to the dermatologist.

1588
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,290
He got two of
the suggestions already.

1589
01:02:41,380 --> 01:02:42,420
He's on fire!

1590
01:02:42,590 --> 01:02:45,250
Aren't you even gonna address
the strange man in your home?

1591
01:02:45,430 --> 01:02:47,920
Yeah, bro, don't you even
want to know who I am?

1592
01:02:48,510 --> 01:02:50,000
I know who you are.

1593
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:51,920
Don, if you'll excuse me,

1594
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:53,840
I think I'm gonna start
giving it to your wife.

1595
01:02:54,350 --> 01:02:55,340
Shut up!

1596
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,480
Just shut up
with that kind of talk!

1597
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:01,270
When we met on that flight,
I was really nice to you.

1598
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,400
I listened to you
tell your stupid story

1599
01:03:03,490 --> 01:03:05,440
over and over again, and

1600
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:07,780
I complimented your hat!

1601
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:13,400
- Brad, we have to stop this.
- He's killing!

1602
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:14,700
Don't you see what's happening?

1603
01:03:14,870 --> 01:03:16,860
I do. I see a room of people
laughing at my father.

1604
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:17,950
- It's amazing.
- Okay.

1605
01:03:18,250 --> 01:03:21,240
- Have some water.
- No, I don't want water.

1606
01:03:24,130 --> 01:03:25,120
Oh!

1607
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:28,420
I don't want water!
I want my wife back.

1608
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:32,430
And I want our Sunday brunches
at the Cracker Barrel.

1609
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:33,550
Braddie, we've got to get him
off the stage.

1610
01:03:34,770 --> 01:03:37,600
All you needed was somebody
to listen to you, and

1611
01:03:38,770 --> 01:03:40,430
all I do is talk.

1612
01:03:40,770 --> 01:03:41,850
On and on and on.

1613
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:43,850
When am I ever gonna learn
to shut my

1614
01:03:44,030 --> 01:03:45,730
big fat mouth?

1615
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:46,810
Ooh.

1616
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:48,770
Oh, Ginny.

1617
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:51,610
Ginny.

1618
01:03:52,410 --> 01:03:54,070
My sweet Ginny.

1619
01:03:54,410 --> 01:03:56,750
Why is he using
my mom's real name?

1620
01:03:59,170 --> 01:04:00,500
Hey, Dad?

1621
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:02,920
Is this true?

1622
01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:06,460
Are you and Mom divorced?

1623
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:10,460
I wanted to tell you, Brad.

1624
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:17,090
Son, you're home
from summer camp!

1625
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:21,600
I don't go to summer camp,
I'm a grown man. Okay?

1626
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,820
Why are you laughing?
I'm not part of this! Okay?

1627
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:30,600
You are a part of this family,

1628
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,030
and you will respect
your parents.

1629
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:33,200
- Yeah.
- Shut up!

1630
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:34,320
- Brad.
- Just shut up.

1631
01:04:34,410 --> 01:04:35,450
Let me out of this bit!

1632
01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:37,700
What about him?
Is he still around?

1633
01:04:37,870 --> 01:04:39,660
Do I have a stepdad?

1634
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:44,540
Stop doing that to me!
I'm a paying customer!

1635
01:04:45,210 --> 01:04:46,700
Brad, let's go.

1636
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:49,420
Come on.

1637
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:00,850
Will you please just go
out there and talk to him?

1638
01:05:01,310 --> 01:05:03,900
He won't talk to me,
and I don't blame him.

1639
01:05:05,020 --> 01:05:07,190
You know, it's not really
all your fault.

1640
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:09,890
You can't blame Dusty.

1641
01:05:10,070 --> 01:05:11,810
He couldn't have known
about Ginny and me

1642
01:05:11,910 --> 01:05:13,740
when he made that
improv suggestion.

1643
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:18,530
- You did know!
- It was pretty obvious, Don.

1644
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:20,200
A guy your age either joins
an improv group

1645
01:05:20,290 --> 01:05:21,410
because his wife left him,

1646
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:22,490
or his wife left him

1647
01:05:22,580 --> 01:05:23,620
because he joined
an improv group.

1648
01:05:23,710 --> 01:05:26,200
- So you did it on purpose?
- No! Well...

1649
01:05:26,630 --> 01:05:28,120
Well, yeah. All right? I did.

1650
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:29,330
You and Brad are all lovey-dovey

1651
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:30,460
and smug
about your relationship.

1652
01:05:30,550 --> 01:05:31,960
I mean, you make out
every chance you get.

1653
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:33,470
Meanwhile,
my dad's ditching out on me.

1654
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,290
Maybe I got a little jealous,
all right?

1655
01:05:35,470 --> 01:05:36,510
Look, I didn't think
you'd freak out

1656
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:39,140
and spill your guts to
a room full of drunken skiers!

1657
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:41,170
- Hey. What is wrong with you?
- What? I didn't...

1658
01:05:41,350 --> 01:05:42,680
Go out there
and fix this right now.

1659
01:05:42,770 --> 01:05:43,760
- Go!
- All right.

1660
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:50,230
Are you serious?

1661
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:51,810
I'm keeping this.

1662
01:06:14,090 --> 01:06:15,330
Are you okay?

1663
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:17,790
Uh...

1664
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:20,220
My parents are divorced.

1665
01:06:20,390 --> 01:06:22,010
Oh. Mine, too.

1666
01:06:22,390 --> 01:06:23,380
Sucks.

1667
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:26,310
- Yeah.
- I think it was my fault.

1668
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:30,350
- Was yours your fault, too?
- I don't know. I hope not.

1669
01:06:30,530 --> 01:06:32,610
I just found out last night.
When did you find out?

1670
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:35,190
- I was a baby.
- Oh, when you were a baby?

1671
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:38,190
Maybe it was your fault.
Were you a difficult baby?

1672
01:06:38,370 --> 01:06:40,030
Um, I don't know.

1673
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:41,540
You know what?
Your lack of specifics

1674
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:43,360
leads me to believe
it was your fault.

1675
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:45,700
No, no, no! You were not
a difficult baby, sweetheart.

1676
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:47,620
Brad, dude,
what are you telling the kid?

1677
01:06:47,790 --> 01:06:50,040
Come on, man. I know
you're upset about last night.

1678
01:06:50,210 --> 01:06:51,700
All right? I'm sorry
about what happened, okay?

1679
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:53,090
I didn't mean to give that
improv suggestion.

1680
01:06:53,170 --> 01:06:55,010
It just...
It just kind of slipped out.

1681
01:06:56,390 --> 01:06:58,300
Know what, Dusty? It's okay.

1682
01:06:58,390 --> 01:06:59,380
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

1683
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:00,550
Oh. Thanks, Brad.

1684
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:01,720
Look, why don't you come in
and talk to Don?

1685
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:02,840
He's feeling a little...

1686
01:07:02,930 --> 01:07:04,800
Oh, my gosh.
I wonder who that could be?

1687
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:07,140
Ooh, what a nice truck!

1688
01:07:15,110 --> 01:07:16,100
Daddy!

1689
01:07:16,610 --> 01:07:20,070
- What are you doing here?
- Come on. What am I doing?

1690
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:22,580
I want to celebrate Christmas
with my perfect little girl.

1691
01:07:22,750 --> 01:07:23,950
Don't you want to
spend the holidays

1692
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,830
with your one true real dad?

1693
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,330
Yeah, come on!

1694
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:28,790
- Let's come see the cabin.
- Hey, Roger.

1695
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:30,740
It's so cool!

1696
01:07:32,670 --> 01:07:33,750
Come on, hurry.
You're going too slow.

1697
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:34,830
I'm coming, sweetheart.

1698
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:37,630
You invite him all the way up
here just to get back at me?

1699
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:38,920
Yeah, I did.

1700
01:07:40,930 --> 01:07:43,670
- Bye, Kurt! Call me!
- Yeah, next time I'm in.

1701
01:07:43,930 --> 01:07:45,600
That's her dad, yeah?

1702
01:07:45,690 --> 01:07:47,180
Uh-huh.

1703
01:07:48,350 --> 01:07:49,720
And you invited him,
too, didn't you?

1704
01:07:49,810 --> 01:07:51,150
I sure did, yep.

1705
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:52,560
I don't know what I missed,

1706
01:07:52,650 --> 01:07:55,310
but this is getting good, boys.

1707
01:07:56,450 --> 01:07:58,110
- I like your style, Brad.
- Hey, hey, hey.

1708
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:02,700
You're opening up
the harbor, Brad.

1709
01:08:02,910 --> 01:08:05,240
Oh. The harbor is wide open,
and it's Fleet Week!

1710
01:08:05,330 --> 01:08:06,370
All right, good.
'Cause I got a few boats

1711
01:08:06,460 --> 01:08:07,450
that want to set sail.

1712
01:08:07,540 --> 01:08:08,580
Yeah, good. So do I.

1713
01:08:08,790 --> 01:08:10,120
You favor little Griffy
over my kids.

1714
01:08:10,210 --> 01:08:11,290
What? I do not!

1715
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:12,580
He gets to sleep in your bed
all the time.

1716
01:08:12,670 --> 01:08:14,210
Megan and Dylan never get to.

1717
01:08:14,380 --> 01:08:15,750
You want them to sleep
in my bed with me?

1718
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:17,710
God, no!
Don't ever think about it!

1719
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:19,120
I'm not thinking about it!
You brought it up.

1720
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:20,250
Good! You better not.

1721
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:21,420
- Shut up!
- Hey, you shut up.

1722
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,180
- You shut up!
- No, you shut up!

1723
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:24,470
Okay. Well, he's not gonna be
part of that

1724
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:25,640
special thing
we got planned tonight,

1725
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:27,390
if that's what you're thinking.

1726
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:28,600
Oh, yeah?
So you're gonna tell Adrianna

1727
01:08:28,690 --> 01:08:30,220
that everyone's invited
to that special thing

1728
01:08:30,310 --> 01:08:31,650
we have planned for tonight,

1729
01:08:31,810 --> 01:08:33,560
except her dad.

1730
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:13,310
Hey. Five more minutes
and I get to be Joseph.

1731
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:16,020
You're not the right type
to play Jesus' dad, Brad.

1732
01:09:16,230 --> 01:09:18,940
He wasn't Jesus' dad,
he was Jesus' stepdad.

1733
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:20,900
And I'm exactly the right type.

1734
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:23,030
You'd better stop hitting me

1735
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:24,450
with that shepherd stick,
Brad. I'm warning you.

1736
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:26,450
Brad's right.
Let him be Joseph.

1737
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:27,660
Thank you, Roger,
I appreciate that.

1738
01:09:27,750 --> 01:09:29,280
It's Brad's turn, Dusty.

1739
01:09:29,460 --> 01:09:31,120
Dad, don't break character.

1740
01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:32,450
And stop trying to butter me up.

1741
01:09:32,630 --> 01:09:35,210
- Can we show some decorum?
- I'm showing decorum.

1742
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:37,500
Shh! You guys, zip it!
You're gonna wake Baby Jesus.

1743
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:42,340
That's it. Give me the beard.

1744
01:09:42,430 --> 01:09:43,670
Don't touch
my Joseph beard, Brad!

1745
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:45,340
- Give him the beard!
- Dad, stay out of it!

1746
01:09:45,510 --> 01:09:46,630
Can we have some respect
for the Nativity?

1747
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:47,880
Cut it out!

1748
01:09:48,390 --> 01:09:50,970
This is stupid.
I don't even get it.

1749
01:09:51,350 --> 01:09:54,020
Why go on a trip when
Mary's about to have a baby?

1750
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:55,430
What's so damn important

1751
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:57,690
you got to go to Bethlehem
in the middle of the night?

1752
01:09:57,780 --> 01:09:58,770
There was a census, okay?

1753
01:09:58,860 --> 01:09:59,980
We covered that
in Sunday School.

1754
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:01,980
Megan, what is going...

1755
01:10:02,950 --> 01:10:04,610
Did you get into the eggnog?

1756
01:10:04,780 --> 01:10:05,900
Hey. Who's up for some IHOP?

1757
01:10:05,990 --> 01:10:07,700
Oh, yeah,
that kid's pickled all right.

1758
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:09,830
Mom, you're pretty.
Can we go to IHOP?

1759
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:11,570
I'm sorry, folks.

1760
01:10:11,660 --> 01:10:13,530
Having some
technical difficulties.

1761
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:16,450
Great, Dad. Now
you've broken the fourth wall!

1762
01:10:16,790 --> 01:10:18,290
None of it's real, folks.

1763
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:21,800
I want to go wait in the car.
Give me the keys, Braaad!

1764
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:24,170
No, I am not giving you
the keys to the car,

1765
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:26,340
because you're drunk
and you're a child.

1766
01:10:26,510 --> 01:10:30,850
Nobody likes your dumb,
stupid Brad voice.

1767
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:32,760
And you smell like pumpkins!

1768
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:35,350
- And you're a mean drunk.
- Kid's got an arm.

1769
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,680
Drunk nine-year-old.
Real nice parenting.

1770
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:40,110
You better watch it, Roger.

1771
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:43,770
Adrianna!
Are you okay, sweetheart?

1772
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:44,900
Is she okay? Is she...
What is she...

1773
01:10:46,870 --> 01:10:48,150
Oh. What a shock.

1774
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:49,860
Now we know
where Megan got the eggnog.

1775
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:51,820
You always assume
she's the bad influence.

1776
01:10:51,910 --> 01:10:54,200
Maybe your daughter plied
my daughter with alcohol.

1777
01:10:54,370 --> 01:10:55,360
Maybe your daughter's that way

1778
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:57,120
because her mother is
a shoplifter.

1779
01:10:57,290 --> 01:10:58,910
Shoplifterrr.

1780
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:01,620
Sara, we've been working on
the shoplifting thing, okay?

1781
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:02,910
But that has nothing to do
with Adrianna

1782
01:11:03,010 --> 01:11:04,210
being such a little nightmare
all the time.

1783
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:05,620
My daughter is not a nightmare!

1784
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:06,710
Come on, Adrianna.

1785
01:11:06,890 --> 01:11:08,630
No, sweetheart,
I didn't mean that. Honey!

1786
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:09,710
Hey.

1787
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:12,550
- What'd you call my daughter?
- He called her a nightmare.

1788
01:11:12,730 --> 01:11:14,510
Hey. I'm a lot of things,
but I'm not a heathen.

1789
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:15,720
Let's take this outside.

1790
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:17,260
Yeah, let's step outside
the manger.

1791
01:11:17,350 --> 01:11:18,390
He called her a nightmare.

1792
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:20,100
- Here we go.
- Now, now, boys,

1793
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:22,150
we can't just leave!

1794
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:25,030
Joseph and the Innkeeper
rumble outside the manger!

1795
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:26,310
Make the first move, Innkeeper.

1796
01:11:26,410 --> 01:11:27,650
Kick his ass, Joseph!

1797
01:11:27,820 --> 01:11:29,910
We are not going to do this
in front of the children!

1798
01:11:29,990 --> 01:11:32,150
Now, what kind of fathers
are you, anyway?

1799
01:11:32,330 --> 01:11:33,610
Oh, that's rich!

1800
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:36,620
Coming from a guy who lies
to his son for six months.

1801
01:11:36,790 --> 01:11:38,030
Maybe that's why everyone thinks

1802
01:11:38,130 --> 01:11:39,460
your stories
are so "delightful,"

1803
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:41,080
because they're all lies!

1804
01:11:41,590 --> 01:11:43,330
Sara, get the kids out
of here, okay?

1805
01:11:43,550 --> 01:11:46,130
Happily. I don't want them
watching this anyway.

1806
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:47,920
Have fun, morons!

1807
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:51,300
- Pancakes, bitches!
- Do not say "bitches."

1808
01:11:51,470 --> 01:11:52,460
Kids are gone. Let's go.

1809
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:53,920
I'm not hitting a guy
dressed like Joseph.

1810
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:55,930
The beard's off, Roger.

1811
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:57,510
How many excuses you want to
pull out, man?

1812
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:58,590
Oh, now it's on.

1813
01:11:58,770 --> 01:12:00,100
- You know what, Brad?
- Don!

1814
01:12:00,270 --> 01:12:01,480
Yes, I lied!

1815
01:12:01,570 --> 01:12:04,560
Because whenever there's
anything wrong in your life,

1816
01:12:04,780 --> 01:12:06,730
if it isn't roses and rainbows,

1817
01:12:06,820 --> 01:12:08,360
you completely fall apart.

1818
01:12:08,530 --> 01:12:10,440
I thought
we had an honest relationship!

1819
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:12,030
Oh, yeah. Brad, I bet you
never told him

1820
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:13,950
about that procedure
you had last year, did you?

1821
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:15,110
Oh, my God. What procedure?

1822
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:17,790
It was nothing,
just some benign tissue.

1823
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:20,700
How about that? You're both
a couple of lying sacks.

1824
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:21,870
And, you!

1825
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:23,130
From the minute you got here,

1826
01:12:23,210 --> 01:12:25,550
you've been nothing but mean
and sarcastic.

1827
01:12:25,710 --> 01:12:26,960
Well, you know what, Kurt?

1828
01:12:27,130 --> 01:12:28,620
- F you!
- Dad!

1829
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:30,460
That's right. Forget you!

1830
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:32,970
Attaboy, swami.
Throwing down F words.

1831
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:35,000
Not the F word, but an F word,
and that's a good start.

1832
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:36,640
Now, come on, give me
the finger, big boy. Come on.

1833
01:12:36,730 --> 01:12:38,390
- Come on.
- Hey! Hey!

1834
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:40,310
Are we gonna still fight
or what?

1835
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:42,690
Roger brings up a good point.
Let's get the momentum back.

1836
01:12:42,860 --> 01:12:45,140
Come on, Roger.
Get some! Let's get in there!

1837
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:47,560
- Come on!
- No, no, no, no, no!

1838
01:12:47,740 --> 01:12:49,940
If you lay one hand
on each other,

1839
01:12:50,030 --> 01:12:51,400
whether the kids are here
or not,

1840
01:12:51,570 --> 01:12:53,740
it will negatively impact them.

1841
01:12:54,330 --> 01:12:56,660
All right. I'm not gonna
lay a hand on him.

1842
01:12:58,580 --> 01:12:59,910
What are you doing?

1843
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:02,670
Oh. Oh, I see.
Yeah, yeah. Snowball fight.

1844
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:05,200
I've got some Nerf guns
in the back of my car.

1845
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:06,580
Want me to get them?

1846
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:08,920
I pitched triple-A for
the Red Sox in their

1847
01:13:09,010 --> 01:13:10,250
farm system, Roger
Don't say I didn't warn you.

1848
01:13:10,430 --> 01:13:12,170
Take your best shot.

1849
01:13:16,430 --> 01:13:17,510
Dad!

1850
01:13:17,850 --> 01:13:19,260
Don, I'm sorry!

1851
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:21,980
That sucks.

1852
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:25,100
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh, no, no, it was all right.

1853
01:13:27,150 --> 01:13:28,810
Hey, no fair.
That's an ice ball.

1854
01:13:28,990 --> 01:13:29,980
You bet it is.

1855
01:13:30,070 --> 01:13:31,940
You know, you throw that
and we are no longer co-dads.

1856
01:13:32,070 --> 01:13:33,440
Oh, I'm way ahead of you,
dickhead.

1857
01:13:33,530 --> 01:13:34,520
You know, from now on,

1858
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:35,730
we'll just act like
a normal blended family

1859
01:13:35,830 --> 01:13:36,990
with me hating your guts.

1860
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:38,070
The kids will never know,

1861
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:39,400
because I'm too good of a dad to

1862
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:41,200
ever throw their stepfather
under the bus.

1863
01:13:41,370 --> 01:13:42,740
But that's right where
you're gonna be, Brad.

1864
01:13:42,830 --> 01:13:44,670
Under my bus.

1865
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:46,250
Well, guess what,
I'm gonna celebrate you

1866
01:13:46,340 --> 01:13:47,670
morning, noon and night

1867
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,050
because
it's the right thing to do

1868
01:13:49,130 --> 01:13:50,170
in front of the kids.

1869
01:13:50,340 --> 01:13:52,170
But just know the way
I really feel about you

1870
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:54,220
is you can suck a fart, Dusty.

1871
01:13:54,510 --> 01:13:57,170
A wet, greasy fart.

1872
01:13:59,770 --> 01:14:01,380
You gonna keep
pump-faking that thing

1873
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:02,590
or you gonna take a shot, Brad?

1874
01:14:02,690 --> 01:14:03,680
Huh?

1875
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:07,100
What? What? Huh?

1876
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:08,930
He's never played sports ever.

1877
01:14:09,030 --> 01:14:10,560
Maybe it's stuck to his hand.

1878
01:14:10,650 --> 01:14:12,060
Oh! Oh!

1879
01:14:13,070 --> 01:14:14,940
Huh? Huh?

1880
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:23,450
That's what I thought.

1881
01:14:23,620 --> 01:14:24,990
You know what, Dusty,
you're not worth it.

1882
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:26,200
Come on, Dad.

1883
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:27,490
Good.

1884
01:14:27,710 --> 01:14:29,290
Psych.
You're totally worth it!

1885
01:14:30,710 --> 01:14:31,700
Dad!

1886
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:35,960
- That was an ice ball.
- Treating your dad like that!

1887
01:14:36,140 --> 01:14:37,130
Dad.

1888
01:14:37,550 --> 01:14:39,550
Look, it was an accident.

1889
01:14:42,350 --> 01:14:43,510
Go ahead, Roger.

1890
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:45,970
Brad was right the first time.

1891
01:14:46,650 --> 01:14:48,140
You're not worth it.

1892
01:14:50,190 --> 01:14:52,180
Dang! Right down my neck!

1893
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:53,560
Don! Sorry! Sorry!

1894
01:14:54,910 --> 01:14:56,900
That guy's like
a snowball magnet.

1895
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:59,450
You were right about
everything. You happy now?

1896
01:14:59,790 --> 01:15:01,530
Ah, Dusty,

1897
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:04,040
I do like being right.

1898
01:15:08,710 --> 01:15:09,870
Hey, is that your baby in there?

1899
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:10,950
Griffy!

1900
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:14,960
I know. I know, sweetie.
It's okay, it's okay.

1901
01:15:15,130 --> 01:15:16,800
I know, I know.

1902
01:15:17,090 --> 01:15:19,760
This was Dusty's idea.
I never wanted to do this.

1903
01:15:57,550 --> 01:15:59,540
Hey, Brad. That one's mine.

1904
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:02,970
- Oh, is this bag yours?
- Yeah.

1905
01:16:08,650 --> 01:16:10,350
Sara? Sara!

1906
01:16:32,340 --> 01:16:33,790
- Oh, my gosh.
- Ew.

1907
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:35,670
What is going on here?

1908
01:16:40,430 --> 01:16:41,420
What's happening, Officer?

1909
01:16:41,510 --> 01:16:43,670
Avalanche hit
the highway up ahead.

1910
01:16:43,850 --> 01:16:45,510
It's gonna take
a few hours to clear it,

1911
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:47,260
so follow the traffic back
into town, all right?

1912
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:50,590
What caused the avalanche?
Was it all the snow?

1913
01:16:50,770 --> 01:16:51,980
Yeah, I'm pretty sure

1914
01:16:52,060 --> 01:16:53,930
snow had something to do
with the avalanche.

1915
01:16:54,110 --> 01:16:55,850
Keep it moving!

1916
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:03,360
Well, I guess we could stop
and have lunch to kill time.

1917
01:17:03,530 --> 01:17:05,200
On Christmas Day?

1918
01:17:05,620 --> 01:17:08,360
- What's gonna be open?
- I don't know.

1919
01:17:14,670 --> 01:17:16,160
Oh, look at that!

1920
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:18,880
Looks like everyone had
the same idea.

1921
01:17:31,650 --> 01:17:34,180
Oh, no. Everything's sold out.

1922
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:35,600
Well, I guess we could see
Missile Tow.

1923
01:17:35,690 --> 01:17:36,730
What's that about?

1924
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:37,980
It's Liam Neeson.

1925
01:17:38,150 --> 01:17:39,390
He's a tow truck driver

1926
01:17:39,490 --> 01:17:40,730
who's on his way home
for Christmas

1927
01:17:40,820 --> 01:17:41,900
with his kids and

1928
01:17:42,070 --> 01:17:43,480
happens along some terrorists

1929
01:17:43,570 --> 01:17:45,280
who've hijacked a mobile ICBM.

1930
01:17:45,450 --> 01:17:46,530
So he hooks it to his rig

1931
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:48,450
and has to get it to NORAD
before Christmas morning.

1932
01:17:48,620 --> 01:17:50,110
I hear it's really good!

1933
01:17:50,290 --> 01:17:52,620
I don't know, Brad, it's PG-13.

1934
01:17:52,790 --> 01:17:55,580
I don't really care
for the salty language.

1935
01:17:55,750 --> 01:17:56,960
Well, it has cute little kids
in it.

1936
01:17:57,050 --> 01:17:58,040
I mean, how dirty can it be?

1937
01:17:58,260 --> 01:17:59,290
Besides, you love Liam Neeson.

1938
01:17:59,380 --> 01:18:00,370
I do.

1939
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:02,040
- Let's just give it a shot.
- Yes!

1940
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:03,800
Looks very heroic.

1941
01:18:03,890 --> 01:18:06,000
- I'll say that much.
- I mean, really. Man!

1942
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:10,720
The front row?
I don't know, Brad.

1943
01:18:10,890 --> 01:18:12,130
- What about the...
- Dad, please stop!

1944
01:18:12,310 --> 01:18:13,520
It's gonna strain your eyes.

1945
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:14,970
We don't have a choice,
all right?

1946
01:18:16,820 --> 01:18:18,480
Look, it's Mom and Brad!

1947
01:18:20,740 --> 01:18:22,900
Santa's got
a present for you bastards.

1948
01:18:32,250 --> 01:18:34,330
You're impounded, asshole.

1949
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:37,170
- You did it, Daddy!
- You killed them all.

1950
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:40,250
No, kids.
We did it. We killed them all.

1951
01:18:40,590 --> 01:18:41,920
Together.

1952
01:18:42,090 --> 01:18:43,500
We love you, Daddy.

1953
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:45,420
I love you, too.

1954
01:18:45,890 --> 01:18:48,720
The only thing that matters
to me in this crazy world

1955
01:18:49,140 --> 01:18:50,550
is you kids.

1956
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:53,550
And I'm sorry
your holiday was ruined

1957
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:55,640
by those godless mother...

1958
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:03,480
Sorry, folks.

1959
01:19:03,570 --> 01:19:05,230
Looks like we're having
a bit of a power outage.

1960
01:19:05,530 --> 01:19:07,490
Uh, we don't know when the
power's gonna come back on,

1961
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:08,940
so you guys are all welcome

1962
01:19:09,030 --> 01:19:10,200
to stay in here or in the lobby.

1963
01:19:10,370 --> 01:19:11,580
The DOT wants everybody

1964
01:19:11,660 --> 01:19:13,030
to stay inside
and off the roads,

1965
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:14,360
so we might be in here
for a while.

1966
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:19,030
You know, I bet this is
because of the snow, too.

1967
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:21,210
Gee, Dad, you think so?

1968
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:48,780
I need to use the gent's.

1969
01:19:48,870 --> 01:19:50,360
Brad, do you need to go tee-tee?

1970
01:19:50,530 --> 01:19:51,990
Dad, don't say that in public!

1971
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:53,110
- Just go.
- All right.

1972
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:57,280
Is he still looking at me?

1973
01:19:58,290 --> 01:19:59,280
Yes.

1974
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:02,120
Is he doing that one look that
he does? You know, like...

1975
01:20:04,010 --> 01:20:05,870
- Is he doing that look?
- Yeah.

1976
01:20:06,220 --> 01:20:08,330
Where he doesn't blink? Yeah.

1977
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:10,710
Yep.

1978
01:20:11,470 --> 01:20:12,710
You know,

1979
01:20:12,970 --> 01:20:14,010
when I said that

1980
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:15,760
Brad was turning you into
something that you're not?

1981
01:20:16,850 --> 01:20:19,440
Maybe, you know,
what I really meant to say

1982
01:20:19,770 --> 01:20:21,100
was that

1983
01:20:21,770 --> 01:20:24,190
Brad's turning you
into something that I'm not,

1984
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:25,810
a good dad.

1985
01:20:27,530 --> 01:20:29,240
No? No,
that didn't do it for you?

1986
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:30,360
Come on.
I thought it was pretty good.

1987
01:20:30,530 --> 01:20:32,440
That whole speech was
in the movie we just saw.

1988
01:20:32,620 --> 01:20:33,860
- Was it?
- Yeah. Word for word.

1989
01:20:33,950 --> 01:20:35,030
Dramatic pauses and all.

1990
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:36,570
Liam Neeson just said that.

1991
01:20:36,660 --> 01:20:38,700
Oh, it must've been
in my subconscious.

1992
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,080
I'm gonna go drain the lizard.

1993
01:20:40,170 --> 01:20:41,160
Yeah. Yeah.

1994
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:48,790
Whoa!
That is a very impressive

1995
01:20:48,970 --> 01:20:52,380
watch. Is that a Rolex?
Mine's a Casio.

1996
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:03,270
You know what, Kurt?

1997
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:04,430
When we first met,

1998
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:07,110
I was so excited about
our being co-grandpas.

1999
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:10,530
And now everybody's miserable!
And my son won't forgive me.

2000
01:21:11,870 --> 01:21:14,030
You know what you and Brad
really need?

2001
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:15,530
Oh, no.

2002
01:21:15,950 --> 01:21:18,620
I'm not taking any advice
from the likes of you.

2003
01:21:18,710 --> 01:21:19,790
No, thank you.

2004
01:21:23,380 --> 01:21:24,870
Okay, what do we need?

2005
01:21:28,220 --> 01:21:30,210
- Hey! Adrianna's here!
- Megan!

2006
01:21:30,380 --> 01:21:31,420
Hi!

2007
01:21:31,510 --> 01:21:34,090
- I can't shake this guy.
- I can't shake this guy.

2008
01:21:34,260 --> 01:21:35,840
- You guys got stuck here, too?
- Yeah.

2009
01:21:36,010 --> 01:21:38,760
And, Dylan, look who else
got stuck. Your girlfriend!

2010
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:40,760
We should
put her under the mistletoe.

2011
01:21:40,850 --> 01:21:41,840
Yeah!

2012
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:43,890
- Come on, stay under.
- Stay.

2013
01:21:47,030 --> 01:21:49,020
You like that girl, don't you?

2014
01:21:50,150 --> 01:21:51,190
Hmm.

2015
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:52,270
Well,

2016
01:21:52,450 --> 01:21:54,860
who knocked down a pin
all by himself?

2017
01:21:55,700 --> 01:21:57,690
- I did?
- Damn right, you did.

2018
01:21:57,870 --> 01:21:59,860
Now go in there
and pick up that spare.

2019
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:02,200
Here she is, Dylan!

2020
01:22:02,870 --> 01:22:04,620
It just doesn't seem right.

2021
01:22:06,420 --> 01:22:07,410
Brad?

2022
01:22:07,670 --> 01:22:09,750
Dad, I really don't want
to dis...

2023
01:22:09,970 --> 01:22:11,630
Jeez.

2024
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:14,630
We're gonna settle this
physically, like men!

2025
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:16,970
And when it's all over, we're
gonna feel a whole lot better.

2026
01:22:17,140 --> 01:22:19,130
At least somebody's
taking my advice today.

2027
01:22:19,310 --> 01:22:20,840
Cut it out! This is
child abuse! Honey, help me!

2028
01:22:20,930 --> 01:22:22,550
Don't be such a snowflake.
Fight back!

2029
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:23,630
Hey, guys,
come on, knock it off.

2030
01:22:23,730 --> 01:22:24,720
You're making a scene,
all right?

2031
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:26,060
Yeah, Don, lean on him!

2032
01:22:26,230 --> 01:22:28,690
Engage me, son,
for the sake of our male bond.

2033
01:22:31,070 --> 01:22:32,560
No, wait, wait, look. Look!

2034
01:22:37,450 --> 01:22:38,780
What's he doing?

2035
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,790
Oh, my God. He's going in
for his first kiss.

2036
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:48,500
Look, she's standing
under the mistletoe.

2037
01:22:48,590 --> 01:22:49,950
Oh, my God. Where's my phone?
Where my phone?

2038
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:51,630
Oh, my God, where's your phone?

2039
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:52,960
Brad, where's your phone!

2040
01:22:53,130 --> 01:22:54,540
Okay, it's right here.
Right here. Yeah. Yeah.

2041
01:22:56,510 --> 01:22:58,670
Look how brave he is.
She's all yours, buddy.

2042
01:22:59,850 --> 01:23:00,840
Unless she's got a boyfriend.

2043
01:23:00,930 --> 01:23:02,010
In that case, there's always
the Friend Zone.

2044
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:03,310
No, there's nothing wrong
with the Friend Zone.

2045
01:23:03,390 --> 01:23:04,550
Guys, he's not going
in the Friend Zone, okay?

2046
01:23:04,730 --> 01:23:05,890
Look at that smile.
She likes him.

2047
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:07,560
Yeah, she wants a kiss.

2048
01:23:34,630 --> 01:23:36,120
My God, he kissed his sister!

2049
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:38,460
Congratulations, you lucky gal.

2050
01:23:39,470 --> 01:23:41,880
I did it, El Padre!
I kissed the girl I like!

2051
01:23:42,060 --> 01:23:44,720
Yeah! Attaboy!

2052
01:23:45,060 --> 01:23:48,140
Whoa! Did you just kiss
your sister? You sick kid!

2053
01:23:48,310 --> 01:23:49,390
Stepsister.

2054
01:23:49,650 --> 01:23:51,360
I mean, still not okay,
I know that.

2055
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:53,060
What? No, no, wait, he's just
a little confused, all right?

2056
01:23:53,150 --> 01:23:54,890
It's no surprise when you look
at who raised him.

2057
01:23:55,070 --> 01:23:56,810
Adrianna, come on.
We're going home.

2058
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:59,190
Wait, wait, Roger, you can't
go out in that storm.

2059
01:23:59,370 --> 01:24:00,480
I was an alternate for Season 3

2060
01:24:00,580 --> 01:24:01,610
Ice Road Truckers.

2061
01:24:01,790 --> 01:24:03,620
- I'll be fine.
- Oh.

2062
01:24:04,290 --> 01:24:05,620
That was their best season.

2063
01:24:06,410 --> 01:24:07,750
I got this.

2064
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:09,670
Wait a minute.
Roger, hold up, man.

2065
01:24:09,830 --> 01:24:12,330
No. From now on, I don't want
you anywhere near my daughter.

2066
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:14,170
I don't want anything to do
with any of you people!

2067
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:15,330
Look, I never wanted to be

2068
01:24:15,420 --> 01:24:16,410
family with you, either, Roger.

2069
01:24:16,510 --> 01:24:17,750
Just like Brad never wanted to
be family with me,

2070
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:18,830
did you, Brad?

2071
01:24:19,010 --> 01:24:20,840
No. Not at all.
I hated your guts.

2072
01:24:21,010 --> 01:24:22,750
In fact, I still kind of do
right now.

2073
01:24:22,930 --> 01:24:24,170
Yeah. Me, too, Brad.

2074
01:24:24,350 --> 01:24:25,760
But we're all connected
by these kids.

2075
01:24:25,850 --> 01:24:26,890
No one's going anywhere.

2076
01:24:27,310 --> 01:24:29,220
- You gonna stop me?
- If I have to, yes.

2077
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:31,430
Yeah, right. You couldn't stop
a clock, you weak tit.

2078
01:24:32,650 --> 01:24:34,230
The hammer.

2079
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:38,530
You know what, Adrianna?

2080
01:24:39,030 --> 01:24:40,190
You're not gonna like this,
young lady,

2081
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:42,020
but this is long overdue.

2082
01:24:45,540 --> 01:24:46,530
I love you.

2083
01:24:46,710 --> 01:24:47,700
Aww.

2084
01:24:48,370 --> 01:24:50,110
- That got me.
- Got me, too. Right here.

2085
01:24:50,290 --> 01:24:51,330
What the hell did you just say?

2086
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:52,950
You heard me. I said,
I love my stepdaughter!

2087
01:24:53,130 --> 01:24:55,540
And I meant it. I should've
said it a long time ago,

2088
01:24:55,710 --> 01:24:57,130
but I was afraid to
put myself out there

2089
01:24:57,220 --> 01:24:59,050
- and risk getting rejected.
- Aww.

2090
01:24:59,550 --> 01:25:00,590
Sweet.

2091
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:02,010
You know what?

2092
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:05,130
Adrianna, you're gonna spend
Christmas with your mom, okay?

2093
01:25:07,310 --> 01:25:08,970
You're not leaving us, Roger.

2094
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:10,970
'Cause I love you, too.

2095
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:15,390
- You take that back!
- Nope. I can't.

2096
01:25:15,570 --> 01:25:16,600
Can't take it back now.

2097
01:25:16,690 --> 01:25:18,480
Everybody heard it.
It's out there.

2098
01:25:18,650 --> 01:25:20,520
- Everybody hear it?
- Yeah.

2099
01:25:21,490 --> 01:25:23,110
You're her dad,
you made her who she is,

2100
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:24,360
and despite her
currently harboring

2101
01:25:24,450 --> 01:25:25,990
a fair amount of resentment
towards me,

2102
01:25:26,160 --> 01:25:28,240
I love her,
so that means I love you, too.

2103
01:25:28,580 --> 01:25:30,370
And I've never been too good
about saying it,

2104
01:25:30,460 --> 01:25:31,910
but I'm gonna follow
Brad's example,

2105
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:33,160
who I also love.

2106
01:25:33,340 --> 01:25:35,420
Now you're just saying things
to choke me up.

2107
01:25:35,590 --> 01:25:36,750
Brad! Cut it out.

2108
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:38,840
- I'm trying.
- I'm a hot mess here.

2109
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:39,910
Don, please!

2110
01:25:40,090 --> 01:25:41,170
You've got to understand,

2111
01:25:41,260 --> 01:25:42,500
when it comes out of nowhere
like that,

2112
01:25:42,590 --> 01:25:43,580
what do you expect?

2113
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:44,970
- Stop!
- I'm stopping.

2114
01:25:45,060 --> 01:25:46,050
- I'm currently stopping.
- We're...

2115
01:25:46,220 --> 01:25:48,380
Yeah, guys. Cut it out,
you're embarrassing me.

2116
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:49,670
I love you, Brad.

2117
01:25:50,060 --> 01:25:51,800
And I love Karen, I love Sara,

2118
01:25:52,730 --> 01:25:54,390
and I love my kids.

2119
01:25:57,320 --> 01:25:58,560
I, uh,

2120
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:03,530
I might need a little
more time with that one.

2121
01:26:03,620 --> 01:26:04,610
Sure, understood.

2122
01:26:04,780 --> 01:26:06,820
But we're making progress.
Maybe for your birthday.

2123
01:26:06,990 --> 01:26:07,980
Yeah.

2124
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:09,110
You know. Unless
you want to say anything?

2125
01:26:09,870 --> 01:26:11,700
- Anything at all?
- Say it, Kurt.

2126
01:26:11,870 --> 01:26:13,710
- Now's the time.
- Just say it, Kurt.

2127
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:14,870
You want to say anything?

2128
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:16,200
It's not that bad.
Just say it.

2129
01:26:16,380 --> 01:26:18,240
- You can do it.
- Do it.

2130
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:21,790
Nah, the birthday's
a good target. Good target.

2131
01:26:22,180 --> 01:26:24,090
All right, Roger,
what do you say?

2132
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:26,790
It's not too late to spend
Christmas with your family.

2133
01:26:45,910 --> 01:26:48,490
It's Christmastime

2134
01:26:49,830 --> 01:26:53,160
There's no need to
be afraid, Roger

2135
01:26:54,370 --> 01:26:56,370
At Christmastime

2136
01:26:57,210 --> 01:27:00,200
We let in light
and we banish shade

2137
01:27:00,420 --> 01:27:02,410
Damn, that's my favorite song
of all time.

2138
01:27:02,590 --> 01:27:06,760
And in our world of plenty

2139
01:27:07,050 --> 01:27:10,550
We can spread a smile of joy

2140
01:27:11,220 --> 01:27:14,560
Throw your arms around the world

2141
01:27:14,890 --> 01:27:16,230
At Christmastime

2142
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:21,150
But say a prayer

2143
01:27:23,490 --> 01:27:25,900
Pray for the other ones!

2144
01:27:26,070 --> 01:27:28,060
I'll play this in August,
I don't even care.

2145
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:29,900
At Christmastime

2146
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:35,240
It's hard,
but when you're having fun

2147
01:27:35,830 --> 01:27:40,170
There's a world
outside your window

2148
01:27:40,750 --> 01:27:44,500
It's a world of dread and fear

2149
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:48,960
Where the only water flowing is

2150
01:27:49,300 --> 01:27:52,140
The bitter sting of tears

2151
01:27:53,220 --> 01:27:56,970
And the Christmas bells
that ring there

2152
01:27:57,310 --> 01:28:00,810
Are the clanging chimes of doom

2153
01:28:01,150 --> 01:28:04,140
Well, tonight thank God
it's them

2154
01:28:04,990 --> 01:28:07,480
Instead of you

2155
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:10,020
Yes! Fantastic!

2156
01:28:14,950 --> 01:28:16,540
He heard it!

2157
01:28:26,420 --> 01:28:27,760
Come on, Roger.

2158
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:31,050
Look.
Yes, we're all stuck here,

2159
01:28:31,390 --> 01:28:33,130
but we're with our loved ones.

2160
01:28:33,310 --> 01:28:35,300
I'm not. I came alone.

2161
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:36,930
Oh. Okay, well,

2162
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:38,260
he came to the movies alone
on Christmas,

2163
01:28:38,350 --> 01:28:39,470
and that's a little sad.

2164
01:28:39,650 --> 01:28:41,600
That's a little sad!

2165
01:28:42,650 --> 01:28:44,140
But you're not alone, sir.

2166
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:45,310
I mean, think about it.

2167
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:46,890
We come to the movies
all the time.

2168
01:28:47,490 --> 01:28:49,400
We sit with hundreds of people.

2169
01:28:49,740 --> 01:28:52,980
And we laugh together,
we cry together,

2170
01:28:53,330 --> 01:28:55,490
but we never look
at each other, do we?

2171
01:28:55,750 --> 01:28:58,410
Brad, it's not a microphone,
it's a mallet. See?

2172
01:28:58,670 --> 01:29:00,660
- They can hear you.
- You can still hear me, right?

2173
01:29:00,750 --> 01:29:01,990
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

2174
01:29:02,170 --> 01:29:03,660
Take a look at each other.

2175
01:29:04,090 --> 01:29:05,170
- That's right.
- Hi.

2176
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:08,590
Give a hug.
Give an embrace.

2177
01:29:08,930 --> 01:29:10,420
What we have here
are the makings

2178
01:29:10,510 --> 01:29:12,420
of a really great
Christmas party.

2179
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:16,210
We have a Christmas tree.
We have music and snacks.

2180
01:29:16,470 --> 01:29:19,430
We have Christmas spirit.
We have mirth.

2181
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:21,060
We have snow!

2182
01:29:21,150 --> 01:29:22,310
You know who doesn't have snow?

2183
01:29:23,190 --> 01:29:25,350
I'll bet he knows who doesn't
have snow, don't you?

2184
01:29:27,990 --> 01:29:30,320
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

2185
01:29:30,950 --> 01:29:32,780
I know where there isn't snow.

2186
01:29:33,370 --> 01:29:36,860
And there won't be snow
in Africa

2187
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:40,160
This Christmastime!

2188
01:29:42,250 --> 01:29:47,250
Do they know
it's Christmastime at all?

2189
01:29:50,220 --> 01:29:51,630
Merry Christmas!

2190
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:53,250
Merry Christmas, folks!

2191
01:29:54,850 --> 01:29:58,640
Feed the world

2192
01:29:58,980 --> 01:30:02,720
Let them know it's Christmastime

2193
01:30:03,060 --> 01:30:05,150
Feed the world

2194
01:30:05,230 --> 01:30:06,270
What?

2195
01:30:07,230 --> 01:30:09,730
Let them know it's Christmastime

2196
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:11,390
"Sara.

2197
01:30:12,070 --> 01:30:13,730
"Beautiful and smart.

2198
01:30:14,070 --> 01:30:16,410
"The mom that everyone loves"?

2199
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:19,700
Oh, my God. She's basing
a character on me!

2200
01:30:56,740 --> 01:30:57,730
All right, guys.

2201
01:30:57,910 --> 01:30:59,150
We're not gonna see them again
till Easter,

2202
01:30:59,240 --> 01:31:00,830
so everybody say good-bye
to El Padre and Pop-Pop.

2203
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,490
- Bye, Dylan.
- Good-bye, El Padre!

2204
01:31:02,790 --> 01:31:04,280
Hey, next time you want to
shoot a guy,

2205
01:31:04,370 --> 01:31:06,790
don't just wing him,
go for center mass, okay?

2206
01:31:07,130 --> 01:31:08,120
Good-bye, Adrianna.

2207
01:31:10,510 --> 01:31:12,340
I don't want you to go, Pop-Pop!

2208
01:31:12,510 --> 01:31:13,670
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, really?

2209
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:15,210
Oh, sure.
Of course, he gets a hug.

2210
01:31:15,390 --> 01:31:16,500
Maybe you can call me

2211
01:31:16,590 --> 01:31:17,960
and tell me more
Pop-Pop stories.

2212
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:19,630
I would love to!

2213
01:31:19,810 --> 01:31:22,090
Oh. And I also signed you up
for SeniorMatch.com.

2214
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:24,430
It's a dating website
for old people like you.

2215
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:26,090
Thank you, sweetie.

2216
01:31:26,980 --> 01:31:28,770
Oh, honey,
it's your mom texting.

2217
01:31:28,860 --> 01:31:30,390
They're just getting off
the plane.

2218
01:31:30,570 --> 01:31:32,020
I'd better go
before they get here.

2219
01:31:32,110 --> 01:31:33,900
I don't want to
make anything awkward.

2220
01:31:34,150 --> 01:31:35,990
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, big man.

2221
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:38,810
- Love you.
- I love you, too, Brad.

2222
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:42,070
Hey, well, yeah,
you have a good flight.

2223
01:31:55,630 --> 01:31:57,420
Yeah, let's not get that going.

2224
01:31:57,590 --> 01:31:58,800
I agree. You've got to
start that younger.

2225
01:31:58,890 --> 01:31:59,970
We missed that window.

2226
01:32:00,140 --> 01:32:01,130
I really appreciate the gesture.

2227
01:32:01,220 --> 01:32:02,460
You do? Oh, then okay.

2228
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:04,470
- Hey. I'll see you, kid.
- See you soon, yeah.

2229
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:05,720
Yeah, bye, kid.

2230
01:32:06,140 --> 01:32:08,480
- Are you coming, Pop-Pop?
- Come on, Captain!

2231
01:32:09,150 --> 01:32:10,140
Bye, Dad.

2232
01:32:11,110 --> 01:32:13,020
You know, Don,
I've been thinking.

2233
01:32:13,110 --> 01:32:14,440
You don't need a dating app.

2234
01:32:14,610 --> 01:32:16,770
What you need is a wingman.

2235
01:32:17,070 --> 01:32:18,400
I switched our flights to Vegas.

2236
01:32:18,490 --> 01:32:20,480
New Year's at Caesar's,
fix you right up.

2237
01:32:20,660 --> 01:32:22,400
Oh, that sounds wonderful!

2238
01:32:22,830 --> 01:32:24,740
Where are we connecting through?

2239
01:32:24,830 --> 01:32:26,160
Don't start with me, Pop-Pop.

2240
01:32:26,910 --> 01:32:28,910
Hey, Braddie.
Don't be nervous now.

2241
01:32:29,170 --> 01:32:30,280
You are the kindest,

2242
01:32:30,380 --> 01:32:32,740
most gentle
and honest guy I know.

2243
01:32:33,090 --> 01:32:35,500
And whoever your mother
brings down that escalator,

2244
01:32:35,670 --> 01:32:36,960
he's gonna love you,
you hear me?

2245
01:32:37,050 --> 01:32:38,340
Grandma!

2246
01:32:42,510 --> 01:32:44,000
Is that Sully?

2247
01:32:44,720 --> 01:32:45,890
Wait, wait, who?

2248
01:32:46,140 --> 01:32:47,550
Sully Sullenberger.

2249
01:32:47,640 --> 01:32:49,230
The guy who saved 155 passengers

2250
01:32:49,310 --> 01:32:50,470
on the miracle on the Hudson!

2251
01:32:50,650 --> 01:32:52,140
Clint Eastwood made
a frickin' movie about it.

2252
01:32:52,230 --> 01:32:53,890
Wait. We watched it at
your house, it was awesome!

2253
01:32:54,070 --> 01:32:55,230
Right.
Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckhart.

2254
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:56,400
I really enjoyed it.

2255
01:32:56,570 --> 01:32:57,780
That guy is a national hero,

2256
01:32:57,860 --> 01:32:59,480
and he's gonna be your stepdad.

2257
01:32:59,860 --> 01:33:00,950
Wow, amazing.

2258
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:03,030
I bet you
he gets free flight vouchers.

2259
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:04,190
And maybe get us some vouchers!

2260
01:33:04,290 --> 01:33:05,280
Maybe.

2261
01:33:05,370 --> 01:33:08,450
Well, don't make him wait.
Go say hi. Go! Go!

2262
01:33:08,750 --> 01:33:09,740
Grandma!

2263
01:33:11,330 --> 01:33:13,330
You must be Brad.

2264
01:33:13,420 --> 01:33:14,410
Nope.

2265
01:33:14,590 --> 01:33:16,290
- No, Brad.
- You're not my dad!

2266
01:33:16,460 --> 01:33:17,630
Brad, no, that's a mistake!

2267
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:19,630
I don't care
how many lives you saved!

2268
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:22,080
You'll never replace him,
do you hear me?

2269
01:33:24,430 --> 01:33:26,300
Brad, he's so nice! Come back!

2270
01:33:26,470 --> 01:33:30,220
You only have one good story,
my father has a million!

2271
01:35:09,830 --> 01:35:11,610
You're listening to
Jason Sinclair at the Panda,

2272
01:35:11,700 --> 01:35:14,070
and I've got a little holiday
recipe for you tonight.

2273
01:35:14,170 --> 01:35:17,200
Two cups of eggnog,
one serving of silk pajamas,

2274
01:35:17,290 --> 01:35:19,710
and a heaping helping
of a loved one.

2275
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:22,380
And I'm gonna add
a pinch of smooth jazz

2276
01:35:22,470 --> 01:35:23,800
on the Panda.

2277
01:35:23,970 --> 01:35:25,800
And I have one question for you.

2278
01:35:25,890 --> 01:35:27,130
Do you know what time it is?

2279
01:35:27,220 --> 01:35:29,260
It's Christmastime

2280
01:35:30,970 --> 01:35:35,180
There's no need to
be afraid, Roger

2281
01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:41,900
At Christmastime, we let in
light and we banish shade

2282
01:35:43,490 --> 01:35:48,230
And in our world of plenty

2283
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:52,320
We can spread a smile of joy

2284
01:35:52,580 --> 01:35:55,820
Throw your arms around the world

2285
01:35:55,920 --> 01:35:58,330
At Christmastime

2286
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:02,210
But say a prayer

2287
01:36:04,550 --> 01:36:06,960
Pray for the other ones!

2288
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:10,510
At Christmastime

2289
01:36:10,850 --> 01:36:15,840
It's hard,
but when you're having fun

2290
01:36:17,190 --> 01:36:21,520
There's a world
outside your window

2291
01:36:22,110 --> 01:36:25,850
It's a world of dread and fear

2292
01:36:26,150 --> 01:36:30,320
Where the only water flowing is

2293
01:36:30,660 --> 01:36:33,490
The bitter sting of tears

2294
01:36:34,580 --> 01:36:36,110
And the Christmas bells

2295
01:36:36,210 --> 01:36:38,320
That ring there

2296
01:36:38,670 --> 01:36:42,160
Are the clanging chimes of doom

2297
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:45,500
Well, tonight thank God
it's them

2298
01:36:46,340 --> 01:36:48,830
Instead of you

2299
01:36:50,930 --> 01:36:54,420
And there won't be snow
in Africa

2300
01:36:55,060 --> 01:36:57,720
This Christmastime!

2301
01:36:59,770 --> 01:37:04,730
The greatest gift
they'll get this year is life

2302
01:37:05,190 --> 01:37:07,680
Life, life

2303
01:37:07,780 --> 01:37:11,860
Where nothing ever grows

2304
01:37:11,950 --> 01:37:15,610
No rain nor rivers flow

2305
01:37:16,660 --> 01:37:21,580
Do they know
it's Christmastime at all?

2306
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:26,670
Here's to you

2307
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:29,210
Raise a glass for everyone

2308
01:37:29,300 --> 01:37:30,710
Here's to them

2309
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:33,260
Underneath that burning sun

2310
01:37:33,350 --> 01:37:38,390
Do they know
it's Christmastime at all?

2311
01:37:54,330 --> 01:37:58,110
Feed the world

2312
01:37:58,450 --> 01:38:02,200
Let them know it's Christmastime

2313
01:38:02,540 --> 01:38:06,710
Feed the world

2314
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:10,840
Let them know it's Christmastime

2315
01:38:10,930 --> 01:38:14,710
Feed the world

2316
01:38:15,050 --> 01:38:18,800
Let them know it's Christmastime

2317
01:38:19,140 --> 01:38:23,390
Feed the world

2318
01:38:23,480 --> 01:38:27,520
Let them know it's Christmastime

2319
01:38:27,610 --> 01:38:31,400
Feed the world

2320
01:38:31,740 --> 01:38:35,480
Let them know it's Christmastime

2321
01:38:35,830 --> 01:38:39,940
Feed the world

2322
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:44,830
Let them know
it's Christmastime again

2323
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:52,420
You know. Last year, the folks
at St. Benedict's, they...

2324
01:38:52,680 --> 01:38:54,260
They had a...
A modern-dress Nativity.

2325
01:38:54,590 --> 01:38:55,710
Everybody hated it at first,

2326
01:38:55,800 --> 01:38:57,720
but you know
the folks at St. Benedict's,

2327
01:38:57,810 --> 01:38:59,260
they got back at 'em, all right.

2328
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:02,100
They won the prize
for most original.

2329
01:39:02,440 --> 01:39:05,600
Then, of course, you have
the Maplewood Christians.

2330
01:39:05,940 --> 01:39:08,020
They had a kind of
friendly competition

2331
01:39:08,110 --> 01:39:10,270
with the Nazarenes,

2332
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:14,270
and took all their hay
last year.

2333
01:39:14,610 --> 01:39:16,450
Yeah, you just try setting up

2334
01:39:17,620 --> 01:39:19,450
a Nativity without hay.

2335
01:39:19,790 --> 01:39:21,620
Merry Christmas, fellas!
