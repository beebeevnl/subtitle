I think we're going to Kentucky.

2
0:0:2.601 --> 0:0:4.569
Fried Chicken?

3
0:0:4.602 --> 0:0:5.769
I love fried chicken.

4
0:0:5.804 --> 0:0:8.340
No, proper Kentucky. Look.

5
0:0:9.207 --> 0:0:11.175
You know what else I love?

6
0:0:11.208 --> 0:0:12.777
Country and western music.

0:0:42.107 --> 0:0:45.143
Oh! Here's where we leave
the casks to age.

12
0:0:45.176 --> 0:0:46.377
Unfortunately, we can't go in,

13
0:0:46.410 --> 0:0:49.046
as it's a temperature-controlled
environment.

14
0:0:49.081 --> 0:0:51.716
So let's move on to
our world class stud farm...

15
0:0:51.748 --> 0:0:54.651
and meet three of
our Kentucky Derby winners.

a few old barrels of whiskey?

19
0:1:2.092 --> 0:1:3.695
Pull the other one, love.

20
0:1:4.562 --> 0:1:5.697
Got it.

21
0:1:13.104 --> 0:1:14.539
Are you getting anything?

22
0:1:15.405 --> 0:1:16.541
Not yet.

23
0:1:18.276 --> 0:1:19.444
EGGSY: Fucking hell.

24
0:1:19.476 --> 0:1:21.278
MERLIN: It's a shame
it's not scotch.

25
0:1:23.447 --> 0:1:25.115
Hang on.

26
0:1:25.150 --> 0:1:26.517
According to this,
there's a huge

27
0:1:26.550 --> 0:1:28.585
underground structure
right beneath us.

28
0:1:28.619 --> 0:1:30.555
And if my calculations
are correct...

29
0:1:34.425 --> 0:1:35.427
This...

30
0:1:36.093 --> 0:1:37.595
is the way in.

31
0:1:40.131 --> 0:1:41.932
Fucking hell, Merlin. Shit.

33
0:1:44.267 --> 0:1:46.503
she always told me...

34
0:1:46.537 --> 0:1:50.074
us southerners get our good
manners from the British.

35
0:1:50.108 --> 0:1:53.211
I was thinkin',
ain't that a pity.

36
0:1:53.244 --> 0:1:55.313
Y'all didn't keep nothing
for yourselves.

37
0:2:2.320 --> 0:2:5.823
Y'all ain't never heard of
knocking before you enter?

38
0:2:5.856 --> 0:2:8.092
Well, actually we had
an invitation. Didn't we?

39
0:2:8.126 --> 0:2:9.260
Yeah.
Oh, did you now?

40
0:2:9.293 --> 0:2:12.229
Yeah. It came in the
shape of a bottle.

41
0:2:12.262 --> 0:2:14.130
We're from the Kingsman
tailor shop in London.

42
0:2:14.164 --> 0:2:15.699
Maybe you've heard of us?

43
0:2:15.733 --> 0:2:16.834
Oh, the Kingsman.

44
0:2:16.867 --> 0:2:19.135
Yeah.
Huh.

45
0:2:19.169 --> 0:2:20.537
That's where y'all got
them fine suits

46
0:2:20.572 --> 0:2:22.173
and them fancy
spectacles y'all got on?

47
0:2:22.206 --> 0:2:23.742
Exactly.
That's right.

48
0:2:23.775 --> 0:2:26.110
Y'all look damn sharp.

49
0:2:26.142 --> 0:2:27.478
Let me see
if I got it right, here.

50
0:2:27.512 --> 0:2:30.782
You want me to believe that
it's normal for a tailor...

51
0:2:30.814 --> 0:2:34.119
to hack through an advanced
biometric security system...

52
0:2:34.151 --> 0:2:36.688
with nothing but a little
bitty old watch on?

53
0:2:42.059 --> 0:2:43.860
I can promise you...

54
0:2:43.894 --> 0:2:44.996
that dog don't hunt.

55
0:2:45.030 --> 0:2:46.664
So why don't you go on and get down
on your knees...

56
0:2:46.697 --> 0:2:48.766
and tell me
who you really work for.
