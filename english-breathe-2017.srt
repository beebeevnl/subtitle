It's more significant
than it sounds.

311
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:56,753
At present, we have an inflated
cuff round our tracheotomy tube

00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,718
to stop food and drink
going down our windpipe.

313
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,918
If we can swallow again,

314
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,992
the cuff can be removed,
and air can get to the larynx.

315
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,071

Hello. What's this?

1116
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:22,119
Oh, I'm having a go
at a Mark II version.

1117
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:25,715
The trouble with the Mark I is
the battery is pretty poor,

1118
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:27,438
and the pump's very noisy,

1119
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:29,278
so I'm having a go
at using a solenoid.

1120
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:31,157
Fascinating. So what is
the battery life?

1121
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:33,390

Incredible.

1124
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,718
Well, if these chairs
of yours really work,

1125
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:45,119
I'm gonna need
a lot of them.

the work myself up to now.

It hasn't set me back
too much,

1129
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:56,272
but if we're to go into production,
we'll need proper funding.

to take into consideration

of polio patients

1133

is less than average,
shall we say.

1134

I'm sorry. I can't see how
I can, in all fairness,

1135

01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:05,875
Robin, you have a question
to ask our hosts.

1271
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:07,393
ROBIN: Yes, I do.

1272
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:12,911
Why do you keep your
disabled people in prisons?

1273
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:15,233
In prisons?

1274
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:17,916
No. No.

1275
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:20,357
We have some of
the finest facilities

1276
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:21,998
in the world for
the severely disabled.

1277
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:24,674
I know, but they're
run by prison guards.

1278
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:26,193
No, not at all.

1279
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:29,636
Well, patients are kept
out of sight.

1280
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:36,032
Not treated as part
of healthy society.

1281
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:37,872
I must ask
that you withdraw that.

1282
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:41,157
Mr. Cavendish doesn't mean
to cause offense.

1283
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:44,516
He's merely suggesting
that the severely disabled

1284
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:47,194
can be better integrated
into society.

1285
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:50,989
Absolutely. I can see
that you all care

1286
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:55,758
very deeply about your disabled people.
I see that.

1287
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:00,274
But let me ask you,
when you look at me,

1288
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:05,351
what is it that you see?

1289
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:10,153
Do you see a creature

1290
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:13,836
that's barely alive?

1291
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:22,679
Or do you see a man
that's escaped the confines

1292
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:26,629
of the hospital walls?

1293
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,468
Now, I have a machine

1294
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:37,710
under this very seat
that breathes for me.

1295
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:46,037
And at home, I have a
ventilator right by my bed.

1296
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:53,319
I also have a remarkable
group of friends.

1297
01:27:55,880 --> 01:27:58,633
And, most vitally,
I have my wife.

1298
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:03,157
But, as you see,
I can do nothing for myself.

1299
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:08,871
And yet here I am.

1300
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:13,880
Now, when I first became
paralyzed, I wanted to die.

1301
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:17,231
Yeah, I wanted to die.
I did.

1302
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:21,311
But my wife wouldn't let me.

1303
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,195
She told me I had to live.

1304
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:30,269
To see our son grow up.

1305
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:35,558
So I went on living

1306
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:39,071
because she told me to.

1307
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:42,556
Because of her, really,

1308
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:48,073
and with her and for her.

1309
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:53,429
And every day since then,

1310
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:57,594
I've accepted
the risk of dying

1311
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:02,479
because I don't want
to just survive.

1312
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:08,955
I want to truly live.

1313
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:16,276
So I implore you,

1314
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:20,115
go back to your hospitals,

1315
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:23,433
and you tell
your disabled patients

1316
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,833
that they too
can truly live.

1317
