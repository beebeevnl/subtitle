1
0:0:12.834 --> 0:0:14.369
Eggsy.

2
0:0:19.374 --> 0:0:21.109
Valentine has to be stopped.
No, I know.

3
0:0:21.144 --> 0:0:22.343
He has a device.
It's all right.

4
0:0:22.377 --> 0:0:24.246
It's sorted. Don't worry.

5
0:0:24.279 --> 0:0:26.282
We got a lot of
catching up to do.

6
0:0:27.048 --> 0:0:29.251
Well, well.

7
0:0:29.284 --> 0:0:31.520
I suppose I should
cancel that taxi.

8
0:0:32.221 --> 0:0:33.656
HARRY: Yes.

9
0:0:33.690 --> 0:0:34.958
If you don't mind...

10
0:0:36.691 --> 0:0:37.894
Merlin.

11
0:0:39.761 --> 0:0:41.797
Welcome back...

12
0:0:41.831 --> 0:0:42.931
Galahad.

13
0:0:47.669 --> 0:0:49.605
EGGSY: Now that we've finished
the debrief, Harry...

14
0:0:49.637 --> 0:0:51.506
here's a couple of
welcome back gifts.

15
0:0:51.541 --> 0:0:53.176
First up...

16
0:0:53.208 --> 0:0:55.176
a brand-new Kingsman watch.

17
0:0:55.209 --> 0:0:56.345
Advanced software,

18
0:0:56.378 --> 0:0:58.447
it can hack into anything
with a microchip.

19
0:0:58.480 --> 0:0:59.847
It is the bollocks.

20
0:0:59.882 --> 0:1:1.350
And Merlin...

21
0:1:1.383 --> 0:1:2.584
MERLIN: I made you these.

22
0:1:6.020 --> 0:1:7.322
A-ha.

23
0:1:25.474 --> 0:1:28.043
Thank you, Merlin, Eggsy.

24
0:1:28.077 --> 0:1:30.179
How do I look?
You look...

25
0:1:30.212 --> 0:1:34.016
Like some faggot lookin' for
an eye fuckin'.

26
0:1:35.783 --> 0:1:37.051
Now...

27
0:1:37.086 --> 0:1:40.289
why don't you
get out of our bar...

28
0:1:40.322 --> 0:1:43.226
before I take out
your other one?

29
0:1:43.258 --> 0:1:45.127
Now, is that any way
to welcome a visitor

30
0:1:45.159 --> 0:1:46.996
from out of town, moonshine?

31
0:1:47.029 --> 0:1:48.431
Okay.

32
0:1:49.597 --> 0:1:52.234
Suck my southern dick...

33
0:1:52.267 --> 0:1:54.102
bitch.

34
0:1:54.136 --> 0:1:56.572
Oh, I don't think
that'll be necessary.

35
0:1:57.840 --> 0:1:59.374
Good day, sir.

36
0:2:3.578 --> 0:2:5.146
Well?

37
0:2:5.181 --> 0:2:7.016
What are you ladies waitin' for?

38
0:2:7.583 --> 0:2:8.885
Manners...

39
0:2:10.618 --> 0:2:11.720
maketh...

40
0:2:14.257 --> 0:2:15.658
man.

41
0:2:17.258 --> 0:2:18.927
Do you know what that means?

42
0:2:21.130 --> 0:2:23.065
Then let me teach you a lesson.

43
0:2:33.507 --> 0:2:35.409
Are we going to stand
around here all day?

44
0:2:35.444 --> 0:2:36.845
Or are we going to...
(GRUNTS)

45
0:2:36.878 --> 0:2:38.412
(GLASS SHATTERS)

46
0:2:38.447 --> 0:2:40.416
MAN: You big...
(MEN WHOOPING)

47
0:2:41.216 --> 0:2:42.918
(GRUNTING)

48
0:2:51.993 --> 0:2:53.095
(GROANS)

49
0:2:58.499 --> 0:3:0.435
Well, pick him up.
