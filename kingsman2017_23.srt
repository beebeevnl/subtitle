0:0:35.477 --> 0:0:36.945
You know what?

3
0:0:36.979 --> 0:0:39.282
That was the best martini
I've ever had.

4
0:0:40.416 --> 0:0:41.784
Keep the change.

5
0:0:41.816 --> 0:0:43.085
Thanks.

0:0:57.599 --> 0:0:58.867
EGGSY: It's all right.
Don't panic.

8
0:0:58.901 --> 0:1:1.638
Just thought I'd bring you
a little leaving present.

9
0:1:7.209 --> 0:1:8.610
What do you think?
He's lovely, isn't he?

0:1:8.644 --> 0:1:9.812
(CHUCKLES)

11
0:1:9.845 --> 0:1:11.380
Would you like to hold him?

12
0:1:14.450 --> 0:1:15.618
Hello.

13
0:1:24.526 --> 0:1:26.762
Do you think I should shoot him?

14
0:1:26.796 --> 0:1:29.265
Are you quite mad?
What? What's the problem?

15
0:1:29.298 --> 0:1:31.400
No! You can't!
Eh? What?

16
0:1:31.434 --> 0:1:33.636
No, you'll have to shoot me!
Shoot you?

17
0:1:33.668 --> 0:1:34.569
Well, I will shoot you.

18
0:1:34.602 --> 0:1:36.072
No. No one's sick enough
to shoot a puppy!

19
0:1:36.104 --> 0:1:37.139
Well, what about you, Harry?

20
0:1:37.173 --> 0:1:38.575
You were sick enough
to shoot a puppy!

21
0:1:38.608 --> 0:1:39.709
Do you remember?

22
0:1:40.642 --> 0:1:42.411

EGGSY: You were sick enough
to shoot a puppy!

25
0:2:32.060 --> 0:2:33.996
It was a blank.
Yes, Harry. Yes!

26
0:2:34.029 --> 0:2:35.097
It was a fucking blank!

27
0:2:35.130 --> 0:2:36.164
That's right. It was a blank!

28
0:2:36.198 --> 0:2:37.467
I would never hurt Mr. Pickle!

29
0:2:37.499 --> 0:2:39.334
Yes, Harry!
He lived to a ripe old age!

30
0:2:39.368 --> 0:2:40.837
He died of pancreatitis!

31
0:2:47.008 --> 0:2:48.711
You're not Mr. Pickle.

32
0:2:55.917 --> 0:2:56.919
Eggsy.

33
0:2:58.887 --> 0:3:0.355
Hello, Harry.
