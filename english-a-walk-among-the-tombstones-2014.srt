1
00:01:00,687 --> 00:01:01,854
You need some help, man.

2
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:03,982
Oh, God.

3
00:01:04,566 --> 00:01:06,025
I don't care.

4
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,527
You want to mess up
your own shit.

5
00:01:08,653 --> 00:01:10,530
But you're going to
mess up mine, too.

6
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:13,408
I need to know you got my back.

7
00:01:13,658 --> 00:01:15,868
Not that you're going to come falling
through the door behind me...

8
00:01:15,952 --> 00:01:18,204
Don't worry your pretty
little spic head off.

9
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,461
Anyway. That was all
I wanted to say.

10
00:01:25,545 --> 00:01:26,546
Is that it?

11
00:01:30,592 --> 00:01:31,676
Fuck you.

12
00:01:42,437 --> 00:01:43,438
Scudder.

13
00:02:34,197 --> 00:02:35,531
Remember us?

14
00:02:35,615 --> 00:02:38,076
Okay, get out. Both of you.

15
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,439
I told you last night that we...

16
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,932
Oh, my God!

17
00:03:02,767 --> 00:03:04,310
Is everybody okay?

18
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:06,187
Get down!

19
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:07,689
Get behind me! Get down!

20
00:03:07,772 --> 00:03:08,773
Move it!

21
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:09,941
Stay low! Duck inside!

22
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:19,130
Hey, Matt.

23
00:06:21,257 --> 00:06:22,341
It's me, Peter.

24
00:06:24,302 --> 00:06:25,678
You know, Peter Kristo...

25
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,346
Oh, Peter. Hi.

26
00:06:28,973 --> 00:06:30,391
Do I know you, Peter?

27
00:06:31,142 --> 00:06:33,686
Yeah, I led a meeting
a few weeks ago.

28
00:06:35,104 --> 00:06:36,731
You know, I'm a painter,

29
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:39,048
got hooked on smack
in art school...

30
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:40,108
Oh, yeah.

31
00:06:40,151 --> 00:06:42,069
You're the guy did
the Jackson Pollock number

32
00:06:42,153 --> 00:06:45,072
on the wall of the john
with the blood from your...

33
00:06:45,156 --> 00:06:46,616
Syringe. Yeah.

34
00:06:46,741 --> 00:06:48,743
Yeah, that was me. I
enjoyed your story.

35
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:51,329
Oh! Thanks. Appreciate it.

36
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:54,081
Do you mind?

37
00:06:54,165 --> 00:06:55,583
Sure, sit down.

38
00:06:58,169 --> 00:06:59,420
Can't smoke in here, honey.

39
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:02,381
Yeah. Something wrong, Peter?

40
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:03,549
Uh...

41
00:07:04,926 --> 00:07:08,095
It's my brother, you know?
He needs your help.

42
00:07:09,013 --> 00:07:10,306
What kind of help?

43
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,435
I think it would be better if
you came out to Clinton Hill,

44
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:16,062
talked about it there with him.

45
00:07:16,145 --> 00:07:17,521
Clinton Hill.

46
00:07:17,605 --> 00:07:21,317
Yeah, he'll pay for your cab out
there and back, and your time.

47
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,527
Whether you take it or not.

48
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:28,407
Please, just hear what he got
to say, that's all I'm asking.

49
00:07:28,491 --> 00:07:30,618
When does your brother
want to have this chat?

50
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,038
Well, you know. Right now.

51
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,791
That's what I was
afraid you were gonna say.

52
00:07:36,874 --> 00:07:38,376
Here you go, Matt.
Thanks, Jenny.

53
00:07:38,626 --> 00:07:39,877
Yeah, I'm sorry.

54
00:07:40,586 --> 00:07:41,796
You're eating.

55
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:43,005
Uh...

56
00:07:43,089 --> 00:07:44,632
I'll come back.

57
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:47,677
Yeah, if you're...

58
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:06,779
Jenny, would you keep this warm
for me, please? I'll be back.

59
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:18,582
Half an hour,
right there on the right.

60
00:08:21,252 --> 00:08:23,546
That's it. Yeah,
it's a nice place, right?

61
00:08:27,258 --> 00:08:28,884
All right, Mr. Matt. Go on up.

62
00:08:28,968 --> 00:08:30,808
Kenny don't like me
smoking in the house, so...

63
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:35,599
Hey, Kenny.

64
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:38,102
Mr. Scudder. Come in.

65
00:08:45,276 --> 00:08:46,444
Can I get you
something to drink?

66
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:49,321
Not a "drink" drink, I know
you know Peter from AA,

67
00:08:49,864 --> 00:08:51,741
but there's coffee made,
or I can offer you a soda.

68
00:08:51,824 --> 00:08:52,867
I'm fine.

69
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:55,619
So you're a private
detective, is that right?

70
00:08:55,703 --> 00:08:57,705
Unlicensed. What's that mean?

71
00:08:58,873 --> 00:09:01,333
It means that sometimes
I do favors for people,

72
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:04,128
and sometimes, in return,
they give me gifts.

73
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:08,716
Gifts. Uh, but you used
to be a cop, right?

74
00:09:09,133 --> 00:09:11,135
Yeah, I was with
the 6th Precinct

75
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:12,303
in the Village for a while.

76
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,598
And before that, I was
over here with the 75th.

77
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:17,558
So Why'd you quit?

78
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:20,186
I didn't like
the hours, Mr. Kristo.

79
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:22,438
Nah, the corruption
got to you, huh?

80
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:24,231
Not really.

81
00:09:24,315 --> 00:09:27,318
It would have been hard to
support my family without it.

82
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:32,698
So, what can I do for you?

83
00:09:35,326 --> 00:09:36,911
Well, this was really
my brother's idea,

84
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:39,163
you know, bringing you out here.

85
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,415
You want, I can leave.

86
00:09:41,499 --> 00:09:42,619
Someone's kidnapped my wife.

87
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:46,670
That's a federal matter.

88
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:48,297
They said not to call the cops.

89
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,508
Naturally they would.
When did this happen?

90
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:53,094
Yesterday.

91
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:54,678
You should be
talking to the FBI.

92
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:56,514
I'm talking to you.
Look, Mr. Kristo...

93
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:58,307
Kenny. Kenny.

94
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:02,186
If you're asking me to run
a bag, deliver money,

95
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,562
that is not something I do.

96
00:10:03,646 --> 00:10:04,855
I already paid them.

97
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,191
When?

98
00:10:07,942 --> 00:10:08,943
Last night.

99
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:10,569
How much?

100
00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:11,695
$400,000.

101
00:10:14,115 --> 00:10:15,533
And your wife? Where is she?

102
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:17,660
She's dead.

103
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,914
I paid them,
but they killed her anyway.

104
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,714
I see.

105
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,844
I'm sorry. I don't
want you to be sorry.

106
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:38,139
I want you to find the men who
did this and bring them to me.

107
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:40,808
You say you paid them
the 400 the same day?

108
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:41,892
That's right.

109
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:48,357
You mind if I ask what kind
of business you're in, Kenny?

110
00:10:49,942 --> 00:10:51,068
Construction.

111
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:53,070
What exactly do you construct?

112
00:10:53,154 --> 00:10:54,155
Houses.

113
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:55,239
Oh.

114
00:10:56,407 --> 00:10:59,952
Then I guess Peter's standing
outside right now because he what?

115
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:02,746
Doesn't like your
building methods?

116
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:06,584
Peter's not supposed to
associate with people like me.

117
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:08,752
People in my profession.

118
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:11,422
Since when is drug
dealing a profession?

119
00:11:12,298 --> 00:11:14,258
I mean, that's the reason,
isn't it?

120
00:11:14,592 --> 00:11:16,927
I'm sitting here and not the cops?
You're a dealer.

121
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:20,014
Properly speaking, I'm more of
a trafficker than a dealer.

122
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:21,807
You understand the distinction.

123
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,102
I really don't give a shit
one way or the other.

124
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:28,272
But whoever it was
took your wife

125
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,900
didn'tjust pick
your name out of a hat.

126
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:34,320
They must have had some idea you
had that kind of cash on hand.

127
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:36,447
That's exactly what
I want you to find out.

128
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,157
Who did this?

129
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:40,284
Now there's $20,000.

130
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,077
Consider it my gift to you.

131
00:11:42,161 --> 00:11:44,663
There's 20 more, you find the
two fucks who killed her.

132
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:48,834
So that you can kill them.

133
00:11:57,843 --> 00:12:00,930
I'm sorry, but I can't help you.

134
00:12:11,941 --> 00:12:14,610
Woulda been nice, you told
me what your brother was.

135
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:15,903
Yeah, you wouldn'ta come.

136
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:17,446
That's right. I wouldn't have.

137
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,165
I stopped drinking that day.

138
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:32,253
Just wasn't as
much fun after that.

139
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:37,341
Well, I guess I'm just a...

140
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:42,346
Anyway, I'm eight years sober.

141
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:45,766
And I... Well...

142
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:50,187
That's all. Thanks.

143
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:10,040
Howie.

144
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:11,709
Hurt yourself?

145
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:13,961
Founditoutback by the dumpster.

146
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:16,255
Mrs. Dolgren in 202

147
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:18,716
left it there when Mr. D
stroked out last week.

148
00:13:21,385 --> 00:13:22,553
Any messages?

149
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:32,229
I never told you her name.

150
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:39,570
I don't want you to
think that I'm cruel

151
00:13:40,738 --> 00:13:42,239
or don't care.

152
00:13:47,161 --> 00:13:48,662
I just can't say it.

153
00:13:53,751 --> 00:13:54,835
What happened?

154
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:04,970
Hey.

155
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:06,096
Hello?

156
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:10,684
Carrie Anne,
what's your game now?

157
00:14:10,768 --> 00:14:11,852
Hello?

158
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:13,604
She never came home, right?

159
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:16,023
Excuse me?

160
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:17,941
We've got your wife, fucko.

161
00:14:24,156 --> 00:14:25,366
Carrie?

162
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:32,956
Carrie?

163
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:36,710
Baby, you up there?

164
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:50,182
What is it you want?

165
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:53,769
We want to help you get your wife back.
If you want her back, that is.

166
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:55,145
Of course I want her back.

167
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:57,022
Good. Then stay by the phone,

168
00:14:57,147 --> 00:15:02,111
don't call the police, and
we'll be in touch. Very soon.

169
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,988
It was maybe 10 minutes
before they called again.

170
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:07,074
How much does your
wife weigh, Mr. Kristo?

171
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:10,327
110, 120? Somewhere
in that neighborhood?

172
00:15:10,411 --> 00:15:13,163
Something like 50 kilograms,
you might say?

173
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:18,752
Now 50 keys, at 20 a key,
run the numbers for me.

174
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:22,172
Comes out to a million,
doesn't it?

175
00:15:23,132 --> 00:15:24,174
What's your point?

176
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:25,634
My point?

177
00:15:26,844 --> 00:15:31,014
My point is that you'd pay a million
for her if she were product.

178
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:34,101
If she was powder, Mr. Kristo.

179
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:36,228
Isn't she worth as much
to you in flesh and blood?

180
00:15:36,437 --> 00:15:38,188
I can't pay what I don't have.

181
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:39,982
How much do you have?

182
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,361
Four hundred.

183
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:45,529
Five.

184
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:47,489
I'm not haggling. I gave you
the top figure right away.

185
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:48,574
It's 400.

186
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:50,033
Oh, Well.

187
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:54,788
That's the best you can do.
Okay. Four hundred it is.

188
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:58,041
Before I give you anything, I want
to make sure my wife is all right.

189
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:00,794
Well, that's impossible.
I'm at a pay phone.

190
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:02,999
How do I even know you've
got her in the first place?

191
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:04,631
Are you familiar with her tits?

192
00:16:04,715 --> 00:16:05,757
Excuse me?

193
00:16:05,883 --> 00:16:08,302
They're quite nice. Would
you recognize one of them?

194
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:11,221
That would be the easiest way.
I could cut one off.

195
00:16:12,264 --> 00:16:13,640
The one with
the cute little mole on it.

196
00:16:13,724 --> 00:16:15,084
And I'll leave it
on your doorstep.

197
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:16,505
Would that put
your mind at rest?

198
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,686
Jesus, don't say that.

199
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:21,398
All right, then let's not talk
any more about proof, okay?

200
00:16:22,441 --> 00:16:24,735
Put the money in two hefty bags.

201
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:27,738
Go to the corner of
Columbia and Commerce

202
00:16:27,863 --> 00:16:30,741
to the pay phone
and wait for my call.

203
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:41,668
Hello.

204
00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:43,086
Where's the money?

205
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,172
In the back seat.
Two bags, like you said.

206
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:49,927
<i>Good. Now leave it. Walk up
Columbia to Richards Street.</i>

207
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:51,762
And then what?

208
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:54,181
Wait on the corner
for five minutes,

209
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:57,142
then walk back,
get in your car and go home.

210
00:16:58,477 --> 00:16:59,937
Well, what about my wife?

211
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:02,940
She'll be in the car
waiting for you.

212
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:11,782
Carrie?

213
00:17:15,244 --> 00:17:16,245
Fuck.

214
00:17:26,797 --> 00:17:28,674
And they run me around,
then finally

215
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:31,218
they tell me she's at home,
waiting for me.

216
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:33,554
I go home
and she's not there either.

217
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:34,888
Carrie!

218
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:41,895
The phone rings again.

219
00:17:41,979 --> 00:17:43,105
Fuck!

220
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:48,485
Where is she?

221
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,821
They send me over to Red Hook.

222
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:55,325
<i>Tell me she's in the trunk
of this abandoned car.</i>

223
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:39,036
They taped this to
the inside of the trunk

224
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:43,665
with a note that said
"for your listening pleasure."

225
00:18:55,761 --> 00:18:57,387
That's my number.

226
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:10,942
It's okay.

227
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:14,321
Look at these. Look at these.

228
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:17,783
I touch them
and the nipples get hard.

229
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:22,412
You get hot even when
you're scared, don't you?

230
00:19:24,915 --> 00:19:26,291
And kiss me.

231
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:31,380
Yeah. Come on, let's
take the tape off of her.

232
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:35,884
Hey, Carrie Anne.

233
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,511
Can anybody...

234
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:45,852
Yes?

235
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:49,606
Where in Red Hook?

236
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:19,886
She tipped me $2, which is twice

237
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:22,305
what anybody else tips,
if they even tip at all.

238
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:23,890
You mentioned a van.

239
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:25,337
Yeah. It was parked right there.

240
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:27,686
Two guys got out of it.

241
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:30,230
I remember they checked
her out pretty good.

242
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:32,433
They were both dressed the
same, some kind of uniform.

243
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,820
They pulled out
after Mrs. Kristo,

244
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:38,655
cut off a Caddy.

245
00:20:40,449 --> 00:20:42,242
You remember what the
van looked like? Yeah.

246
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:45,579
It was light blue.
It was definitely light blue.

247
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:48,610
I could tell
she was a good cook.

248
00:20:48,623 --> 00:20:50,375
Nothing frozen in her cart.

249
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:52,085
She said she was making kunafa,

250
00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:54,169
so I sent her to the Lebanese
place down the block.

251
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:56,047
Yeah, the van was
parked across the street.

252
00:20:56,131 --> 00:20:57,883
I thought they were
making a delivery.

253
00:20:57,966 --> 00:20:59,259
I don't remember a van.

254
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:02,053
I do remember the pita maker,
Mrs. Youness, came in

255
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:05,182
and was all like, "Oh, what happened?
Are we okay?"

256
00:21:09,186 --> 00:21:10,937
She saw two men and a woman

257
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:14,733
run across the street away from
the store and leap into a van.

258
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:16,943
She thought they had
just robbed the store.

259
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:18,028
Two men?

260
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:20,906
Yeah.

261
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:23,575
I think it had the name of a
TV repair place on the side.

262
00:21:23,658 --> 00:21:26,244
TWO initials, like B & R TV.

263
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,288
For sure. J & M Heating.

264
00:21:29,581 --> 00:21:30,624
R & L Stereo.

265
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:32,542
B & A Appliance.

266
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:46,241
TJ, I'd like a word with you.

267
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:48,577
Now, please.

268
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,458
I know you've
been sleeping here.

269
00:22:55,876 --> 00:22:56,960
Shit.

270
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:00,797
I know because Mr. Keyser

271
00:23:00,881 --> 00:23:03,633
says you left a god-awful
mess in the men's room.

272
00:23:05,635 --> 00:23:08,471
Not to mention
the mess you've left here.

273
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:11,224
TJ, you've got to...

274
00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:14,185
He'll clean it up later, okay?

275
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,188
Right now he's helping me
with something.

276
00:23:25,697 --> 00:23:28,533
You get back issues of all the
New York papers on there?

277
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:30,410
For what?

278
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:32,454
Naw, I'm good.

279
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:34,414
Can see from right here.

280
00:23:34,956 --> 00:23:38,084
Not the first old
white dude, come in here,

281
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:39,419
try to put a hand on me.

282
00:23:40,045 --> 00:23:41,046
Okay.

283
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,517
Child ofGod.

284
00:23:56,937 --> 00:23:57,938
What?

285
00:23:58,355 --> 00:24:01,358
The name. Gotteskind.
It means "child of God."

286
00:24:01,566 --> 00:24:02,567
It's German.

287
00:24:05,946 --> 00:24:07,572
Except, clearly,

288
00:24:07,656 --> 00:24:09,449
God never looked out for Marie.

289
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:25,548
TJ? That short for something?

290
00:24:26,216 --> 00:24:28,009
Yeah, it's short for "TJ."

291
00:24:31,721 --> 00:24:32,721
YOU 5-0?

292
00:24:32,764 --> 00:24:33,765
Nope.

293
00:24:33,974 --> 00:24:35,094
'Cause you've got that look.

294
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,351
I work private.

295
00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:40,438
Yeah? Like Sam Spade?

296
00:24:40,563 --> 00:24:41,898
Yeah, just like him.

297
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:46,277
What I'm saying is, I read about him.
And Marlowe, too.

298
00:24:46,444 --> 00:24:47,737
All of those guys.

299
00:24:47,946 --> 00:24:49,239
You spend that much
time in here?

300
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:52,534
Some. Mostly when it rains.

301
00:24:52,617 --> 00:24:54,137
Just like the sound
it makes, you know?

302
00:24:55,412 --> 00:24:56,413
Matt.

303
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,581
Short for Matthew.

304
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:03,545
So why you looking at
dead bitches, Matthew?

305
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:38,538
So these guys we 're
looking for, they be like

306
00:25:38,621 --> 00:25:40,874
real 730, or just, like, thugs?

307
00:25:41,124 --> 00:25:42,208
Like real what?

308
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:46,212
730. It's the time they give
out the meds in a mental ward.

309
00:25:46,671 --> 00:25:48,465
Ah. Right. 73o.

310
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:52,052
Can that program go
back another year?

311
00:25:52,135 --> 00:25:54,471
Listen to you. "That program."

312
00:25:54,971 --> 00:25:56,639
Take you maybe
a minute to figure out

313
00:25:56,723 --> 00:25:59,142
how to work Yahoo
all by yourself.

314
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:00,810
Why bother?

315
00:26:00,894 --> 00:26:03,730
From what I hear, it's all
going to shit in six months.

316
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:04,814
Please, please, man.

317
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:06,566
I got way more
important things to do

318
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:09,319
than worry about
all that Y2K bullshit.

319
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:11,279
Hmm.

320
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:12,655
How ironical.

321
00:26:13,364 --> 00:26:14,365
What's that?

322
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:17,160
Dumping an already dead
body at a cemetery.

323
00:26:17,744 --> 00:26:19,704
Tuesday. The body
of Leila Andresen

324
00:26:19,788 --> 00:26:22,749
a 25-year-old Interior Design
major at Brooklyn College

325
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:25,001
was found at
Green-Wood Cemetery.

326
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:28,171
Andresen had been missing two
days when Eduardo Solomon,

327
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,799
florist across the street
from the cemetery,

328
00:26:30,882 --> 00:26:32,383
found what was later identified

329
00:26:32,467 --> 00:26:34,219
as a portion of the victim's leg

330
00:26:34,344 --> 00:26:35,929
in the dumpster behind his shop.

331
00:26:36,846 --> 00:26:39,182
That same day,
more human remains were found

332
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:42,018
scattered about the cemetery
by a groundskeeper.

333
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:45,021
Witnesses say
Andresen was last seen

334
00:26:45,105 --> 00:26:47,232
getting into a blue van
with three men.

335
00:26:51,152 --> 00:26:53,530
Andresen's fiancé,
Reuben Quintana,

336
00:26:53,613 --> 00:26:56,449
told police that he and Leila were
supposed to meet up for lunch.

337
00:26:57,617 --> 00:26:58,785
But she never showed.

338
00:26:59,744 --> 00:27:00,745
Good guess.

339
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:02,497
Thanks for your help.

340
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,083
What's this? What's what?

341
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:07,377
My time is valuable, man.

342
00:27:07,877 --> 00:27:09,379
How valuable?

343
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:14,634
Ten bucks.

344
00:27:17,095 --> 00:27:18,805
Here's $20. Take it easy.

345
00:27:24,227 --> 00:27:26,688
I'm going to go get
something to eat.

346
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:32,318
Want a hamburger or something?

347
00:27:34,237 --> 00:27:35,405
I don't eat meat.

348
00:27:35,905 --> 00:27:36,906
Oh.

349
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:39,492
Okay. Nice meeting you, TJ.

350
00:27:42,287 --> 00:27:45,582
What I'm saying is, I don't
care nothing about cows.

351
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:48,293
I just care about what
I put inside my body.

352
00:27:48,418 --> 00:27:51,754
No meat, no soda, no
Pringles, none of that shit.

353
00:27:52,589 --> 00:27:55,216
But I was thinking about getting
a little eat on myself.

354
00:27:55,425 --> 00:27:58,761
All right. So we can both
get our eat ons together.

355
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:00,180
Come on.

356
00:28:04,851 --> 00:28:06,060
Come on, Watson.

357
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,228
Where do you sleep?

358
00:28:48,645 --> 00:28:50,813
Those nights you
can't hide in the library?

359
00:28:52,482 --> 00:28:53,942
There's places to stay.

360
00:28:54,984 --> 00:28:56,569
What happened to your parents?

361
00:28:57,487 --> 00:28:59,155
You don't gotta
feel sorry for me.

362
00:28:59,864 --> 00:29:00,865
I don't.

363
00:29:01,491 --> 00:29:02,492
Good.

364
00:29:05,495 --> 00:29:08,331
You could hire me, though.
Make me your partner.

365
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:10,250
I don't think so.

366
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:12,813
Why? You don't think I got what
it takes to be a good detective?

367
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:15,672
I'm sure you do. I'm just
not the partner type.

368
00:29:18,341 --> 00:29:20,843
What does it take to be
a good detective anyway?

369
00:29:20,927 --> 00:29:22,095
A strong bladder.

370
00:29:23,054 --> 00:29:24,055
Seriously.

371
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,849
I don't know what it takes.

372
00:29:27,684 --> 00:29:32,605
I don't know. Patience. Instincts.
Uh, blind luck, mostly.

373
00:29:33,523 --> 00:29:36,651
And a good name. A good
name is very important.

374
00:29:36,734 --> 00:29:40,947
One with real flavor like Sam
Spade or Philip Marlowe.

375
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:43,116
What's wrong with
the name you got?

376
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:44,951
I don't know, man.

377
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:46,828
Thinking something more like.

378
00:29:47,662 --> 00:29:49,080
Daunte Culpepper.

379
00:29:49,956 --> 00:29:51,624
Quarterback for Minnesota?

380
00:29:51,749 --> 00:29:52,750
Mmm-hmm.

381
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:54,752
It's a good name
for a detective,

382
00:29:54,836 --> 00:29:57,255
but a lame-ass name for a
guy who plays football.

383
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:00,049
Daunte Culpepper.

384
00:30:00,925 --> 00:30:04,637
Yeah. Daunte Culpepper.
Private eye.

385
00:30:05,722 --> 00:30:07,307
Now I like that name a lot.

386
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:10,310
Sure you don't want a
soda or something, honey?

387
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:14,022
I know you just love to give
a young black man like myself

388
00:30:14,105 --> 00:30:15,606
one of your sperm-killer sodas.

389
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:18,067
But no thank you, ma'am. I'll
just stick with the water.

390
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:26,284
What? They only give sodas
to low-income people.

391
00:30:26,367 --> 00:30:28,661
With a bunch of chemicals
in them to sterilize you.

392
00:30:28,745 --> 00:30:30,371
That's why I only drink water.

393
00:30:30,455 --> 00:30:32,165
A gallon a day
and stay hydrated.

394
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:34,000
You don't eat meat?

395
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:36,557
Yeah. So what. You got
a problem with that?

396
00:30:36,586 --> 00:30:39,130
Not at all. My ex-wife,
she was vegetarian.

397
00:30:39,464 --> 00:30:41,382
So what happened?
Why'd you split?

398
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:42,884
What was she? A clucker?

399
00:30:43,092 --> 00:30:44,093
A what?

400
00:30:44,177 --> 00:30:45,928
A clucker. Chickenhead.

401
00:30:46,012 --> 00:30:48,139
You know, those females
that only like you

402
00:30:48,222 --> 00:30:49,432
if you give them nice things.

403
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:51,684
If you ain't bling-blinging,
you ain't seeing shit.

404
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,269
Can't you speak English?

405
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:55,813
Hit a nerve. Sorry.

406
00:30:56,856 --> 00:30:58,191
Wait a minute. What time is it?

407
00:30:58,858 --> 00:31:00,318
Almost 10:00. Shit.

408
00:31:00,401 --> 00:31:03,321
I gotta get back to the shelter.
It closes at 10:00.

409
00:31:03,404 --> 00:31:04,906
Uh, thanks for the pancakes.

410
00:32:27,488 --> 00:32:28,489
Jonas Loogan?

411
00:32:29,323 --> 00:32:30,366
Yes?

412
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:31,701
You're the gardener here?

413
00:32:33,035 --> 00:32:34,704
I'm the groundskeeper.
Can I help you?

414
00:32:35,163 --> 00:32:37,123
I'm Matthew Scudder. Whoa!

415
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:40,376
That was fast. Public
affairs lady at the 77th

416
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,462
said it would be at least a week
before anyone got back to me.

417
00:32:42,837 --> 00:32:43,838
Excuse me?

418
00:32:44,005 --> 00:32:45,965
I just really want the book to
have an authentic feel, you know?

419
00:32:46,048 --> 00:32:47,049
Book?

420
00:32:47,133 --> 00:32:49,093
That's why this ride along is
so important to me, you know?

421
00:32:49,177 --> 00:32:50,595
Spend some real time
with real cops?

422
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,809
What do you want?

423
00:32:56,893 --> 00:32:59,187
I was hoping I could talk to
you about Leila Andresen.

424
00:33:00,188 --> 00:33:01,189
Who?

425
00:33:01,522 --> 00:33:03,316
The woman they found over here.

426
00:33:04,192 --> 00:33:06,652
Yeah, I don't know
anything about that.

427
00:33:06,736 --> 00:33:08,946
Your boss tells me
you were here that day.

428
00:33:09,614 --> 00:33:11,365
You spoke to Larry? Yeah.

429
00:33:11,574 --> 00:33:13,910
Great. 'Cause my boss
is Gretchen, okay?

430
00:33:15,036 --> 00:33:16,996
Oh, boy. I messed up.

431
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:20,249
You're too smart
for me, Jonas. Damn.

432
00:33:21,459 --> 00:33:22,627
Think you can help me anyway?

433
00:33:23,294 --> 00:33:25,087
Already told everything
I know to the police.

434
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:28,424
Eduardo. Guy who owns
the shop across the street,

435
00:33:28,508 --> 00:33:30,343
says there were about 20
garbage bags that were here.

436
00:33:30,426 --> 00:33:31,427
That true?

437
00:33:31,511 --> 00:33:33,429
Eduardo was wrong.
There were only about 10.

438
00:33:33,513 --> 00:33:35,806
And most of those were
on the Fifth Avenue side.

439
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:38,142
And there were four more
floating in the pond down there.

440
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:40,102
So you saw them?

441
00:33:41,145 --> 00:33:42,647
I saw the pigeon first.

442
00:33:43,731 --> 00:33:45,191
Keep a coop on my roof.

443
00:33:46,317 --> 00:33:47,527
This was a Helmet.

444
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:48,653
It was alone.

445
00:33:48,736 --> 00:33:50,488
Which, if you know anything
at all about Helmets,

446
00:33:50,571 --> 00:33:52,365
is quite unusual for that breed.

447
00:33:52,448 --> 00:33:53,824
<i>It was sitting
on one of the bags</i>

448
00:33:53,908 --> 00:33:56,327
trying to get at
whatever was in there.

449
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:57,954
<i>I just fished them
both out after I was done</i>

450
00:33:58,037 --> 00:33:59,330
with the mowing
and threw them away.

451
00:33:59,413 --> 00:34:00,540
You didn't open them?

452
00:34:01,624 --> 00:34:05,169
No. I figured it was all
just some waterlogged trash

453
00:34:05,253 --> 00:34:08,089
that kids had thrown
in there the night before.

454
00:34:08,172 --> 00:34:09,882
They do that, you know?

455
00:34:09,966 --> 00:34:12,176
Throw their rubbers and their
empties into the pond.

456
00:34:13,928 --> 00:34:15,846
You see the cops
across the street?

457
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:17,682
Yeah, but I didn't
make that connection

458
00:34:17,765 --> 00:34:20,226
until Vince came running over
from the Fifth Avenue entrance.

459
00:34:20,309 --> 00:34:21,727
Vince.

460
00:34:21,811 --> 00:34:23,771
Yeah, he's the other
groundskeeper.

461
00:34:23,854 --> 00:34:25,147
He's the one that
found the bags over there.

462
00:34:25,398 --> 00:34:27,441
Is Vince around?
I'd like to talk to him.

463
00:34:27,567 --> 00:34:28,568
He quit.

464
00:34:29,235 --> 00:34:30,820
He opened one of the bags.

465
00:34:34,991 --> 00:34:37,493
You know, I was just starting
to forget about her.

466
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,830
Thank you so much
for bringing that all back.

467
00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:42,206
What's your book about?

468
00:34:43,416 --> 00:34:45,084
Don't patronize me.

469
00:36:15,925 --> 00:36:17,468
Yo, Matt,
what's the dealie, man?

470
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:18,551
Hello, TJ.

471
00:36:18,594 --> 00:36:19,754
You know I been shadowing you.

472
00:36:19,762 --> 00:36:20,846
No kidding.

473
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:23,474
Aiight. So, "I followed
subject back"

474
00:36:23,557 --> 00:36:25,434
"from dinner to
a meeting at some church."

475
00:36:25,935 --> 00:36:27,269
Used to drink some, huh?

476
00:36:29,105 --> 00:36:32,191
"L then followed subject back to
some shitty-assed building on 45th"

477
00:36:32,274 --> 00:36:33,609
"where subject
remained until..."

478
00:36:33,693 --> 00:36:35,236
I know where I was, TJ.

479
00:36:36,862 --> 00:36:38,698
You made me at that
flower shop, didn't you?

480
00:36:38,781 --> 00:36:40,658
I made you back at the subway.

481
00:36:40,741 --> 00:36:41,867
Damn.

482
00:36:41,951 --> 00:36:43,869
This book I'm reading
says a foot tail is hard

483
00:36:43,953 --> 00:36:45,996
to do on account of
they're so easy to spot.

484
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,123
That it is.

485
00:36:47,248 --> 00:36:48,791
It says it's good
to use three guys.

486
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:50,251
Two alternating
behind and another guy

487
00:36:50,334 --> 00:36:51,377
on the other side of the street.

488
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,087
Sure. If you have three guys.

489
00:36:53,963 --> 00:36:55,381
You know you spend a lot of time

490
00:36:55,464 --> 00:36:57,550
at churches and you
use a lot of payphones.

491
00:36:57,633 --> 00:36:58,968
So?

492
00:36:59,093 --> 00:37:00,386
So you don't got no cell phone?

493
00:37:00,469 --> 00:37:01,470
I don't like them.

494
00:37:01,554 --> 00:37:03,754
You don't like computers and
you don't like cell phones.

495
00:37:03,764 --> 00:37:06,267
Fucking Amish got more flavor
than you do, Matthew.

496
00:37:07,143 --> 00:37:08,743
You know, I watched
you follow some dude,

497
00:37:08,769 --> 00:37:10,187
you didn't even try
to hide or nothing.

498
00:37:10,271 --> 00:37:11,814
He wasn't looking for me.

499
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:14,275
Funny. Me following you while
you following some other guy.

500
00:37:15,151 --> 00:37:16,485
It's real ironical.

501
00:37:26,829 --> 00:37:28,164
TJ? Yeah?

502
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:29,331
Stop following me.

503
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:36,422
Okay. No. No.

504
00:37:38,174 --> 00:37:39,341
Reuben Quintana?

505
00:37:39,425 --> 00:37:40,465
I help you with something?

506
00:37:40,885 --> 00:37:42,261
My name is Matt Scudder.

507
00:37:42,344 --> 00:37:44,625
I was wondering if I could talk
to you about your fiancée?

508
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,682
Fiancée? Leila Andresen?

509
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:48,559
Oh. Leila. Um...

510
00:37:48,642 --> 00:37:50,227
You know, I kind of have this
other place I have to be...

511
00:37:50,478 --> 00:37:51,562
I'll just be a minute.

512
00:37:52,521 --> 00:37:53,689
Yeah, okay.

513
00:37:55,524 --> 00:37:56,525
Yeah, come on in.

514
00:37:58,527 --> 00:38:00,070
I get you something to drink?

515
00:38:00,154 --> 00:38:01,572
No, thank you.

516
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,368
It must be nice, have the time to
work out in the middle of the day.

517
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,995
I'd rather be working.

518
00:38:08,204 --> 00:38:10,664
Period. I'm an actor.

519
00:38:11,207 --> 00:38:13,334
Yeah, I thought
you looked familiar.

520
00:38:13,417 --> 00:38:15,211
Have I seen something
you've been in?

521
00:38:15,336 --> 00:38:17,046
Maybe. I did
a Stetson commercial.

522
00:38:17,129 --> 00:38:18,130
Few years back.

523
00:38:18,214 --> 00:38:19,214
Stetson, the hat?

524
00:38:19,256 --> 00:38:20,257
No, the cologne.

525
00:38:20,758 --> 00:38:23,219
Oh. Ran during the
Stanley Cup Finals.

526
00:38:23,302 --> 00:38:24,762
Missed that one.

527
00:38:27,056 --> 00:38:28,891
Leila went to Brooklyn
College, is that right?

528
00:38:29,183 --> 00:38:30,476
Studied decorating?

529
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:31,894
Interior design.

530
00:38:32,186 --> 00:38:33,187
Right.

531
00:38:34,313 --> 00:38:36,982
You told the police that
it was three men took her.

532
00:38:37,066 --> 00:38:38,067
Yeah, that's right.

533
00:38:38,192 --> 00:38:39,443
You're sure about that?

534
00:38:39,527 --> 00:38:41,237
Yeah. I saw them.

535
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:44,490
I was at this coffee
place on Prospect...

536
00:38:44,573 --> 00:38:46,659
She used to meet me
there sometimes.

537
00:38:46,742 --> 00:38:49,912
When I see two guys jump
out of the van and grab her.

538
00:38:52,331 --> 00:38:53,332
What'd they look like?

539
00:38:53,707 --> 00:38:55,027
I couldn't really
see their faces.

540
00:38:55,209 --> 00:38:57,419
But I could see a third
guy behind the wheel.

541
00:38:59,588 --> 00:39:00,589
Move!

542
00:39:01,382 --> 00:39:03,509
Hey! What the fuck
are you doing?

543
00:39:04,009 --> 00:39:05,249
That's the last time I saw her.

544
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:07,429
This is a nice place.

545
00:39:07,763 --> 00:39:09,181
Lots of nice stuff.

546
00:39:09,348 --> 00:39:10,724
Leila do the design?

547
00:39:10,933 --> 00:39:13,185
Yeah. You should see
the bedroom, it's...

548
00:39:14,728 --> 00:39:16,397
Wait, I...
That didn't sound right.

549
00:39:17,398 --> 00:39:19,358
You don't deal, do you, Reuben?

550
00:39:19,567 --> 00:39:21,026
What? You heard me.

551
00:39:21,277 --> 00:39:22,528
You asking, am I a drug dealer?

552
00:39:22,611 --> 00:39:23,988
Unless you prefer trafficker.

553
00:39:24,697 --> 00:39:26,115
Or maybe you wanna
tell me you made

554
00:39:26,198 --> 00:39:28,200
your money peddling
cologne on ESPN.

555
00:39:28,284 --> 00:39:29,285
I got a trust fund.

556
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:32,121
From your rich family
up in the Bronx? Yeah.

557
00:39:32,371 --> 00:39:33,914
My mom won a lawsuit
a few years back.

558
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:37,626
Hey, come on, Reuben, not even the
dog's dumb enough to buy that one.

559
00:39:38,878 --> 00:39:41,589
Look, I don't care how
you earn your living.

560
00:39:41,672 --> 00:39:44,341
But the guys who grabbed Leila?
They might have.

561
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,801
How do you mean?

562
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:51,056
How do you mean?

563
00:39:51,307 --> 00:39:52,433
Thanks for your time.

564
00:39:55,311 --> 00:39:56,645
Thank you.

565
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:20,294
Jonas? Did you
forget your key again?

566
00:40:53,243 --> 00:40:55,120
What the hell is going on?
Cops showing up

567
00:40:55,204 --> 00:40:56,956
to my house asking about Leila.

568
00:40:57,247 --> 00:40:58,624
Who the hell is this guy?

569
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:50,509
"He carried
her through the field,

570
00:41:51,593 --> 00:41:54,930
"the dandelions and cattails
still wet with morning dew,

571
00:41:55,681 --> 00:41:57,182
"and set her down by a stream,

572
00:41:57,975 --> 00:41:59,560
"whispering through the strands

573
00:41:59,643 --> 00:42:01,520
"of her fine yellow hair,

574
00:42:02,062 --> 00:42:05,024
"'You're safe now.
You're safe."'

575
00:42:07,276 --> 00:42:08,444
Fuck.

576
00:42:46,482 --> 00:42:47,649
Jonas.

577
00:42:51,487 --> 00:42:52,488
You caught me.

578
00:42:54,782 --> 00:42:57,409
You gave the cops a different
address, didn't you?

579
00:42:57,951 --> 00:43:00,329
That's why they never put you
across the street from Leila.

580
00:43:02,664 --> 00:43:04,875
This is my mother's building.

581
00:43:04,958 --> 00:43:08,212
I live in Sunset Park, but I'm not
allowed to keep my birds there.

582
00:43:08,295 --> 00:43:10,214
Even though there's
room on the roof.

583
00:43:12,007 --> 00:43:13,842
Your mom home right now?
Maybe we could

584
00:43:13,926 --> 00:43:15,761
go down and talk,
have a cup of coffee.

585
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:19,181
I can't let you leave here.

586
00:43:20,057 --> 00:43:21,683
They'll kill me if I do.

587
00:43:21,767 --> 00:43:23,060
Who's "they," Jonas?

588
00:43:23,143 --> 00:43:24,144
The other two.

589
00:43:24,728 --> 00:43:27,731
So what, you gonna stab me now
with that big fucking knife?

590
00:43:29,858 --> 00:43:32,486
It's gonna bother me, too. For
a long time, I know it will.

591
00:43:32,736 --> 00:43:33,987
How much is it gonna bother you

592
00:43:34,071 --> 00:43:36,448
I take that knife away
and stick it in your neck?

593
00:43:37,533 --> 00:43:38,575
Could you really do that?

594
00:43:38,867 --> 00:43:40,285
Yeah, I really could.

595
00:43:40,452 --> 00:43:41,787
But I'd rather not.

596
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:44,039
How about instead we trade?

597
00:43:46,208 --> 00:43:47,251
Okay.

598
00:43:47,334 --> 00:43:48,335
Set it down.

599
00:43:58,303 --> 00:43:59,763
What was it I said
that gave me away?

600
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:02,432
Everything.
You're a weirdo, Jonas.

601
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:05,060
I never laid a hand on Leila.

602
00:44:06,603 --> 00:44:08,923
But the other two, they're the
ones you better worry about.

603
00:44:08,981 --> 00:44:10,232
What other two?

604
00:44:13,944 --> 00:44:15,112
Jonas.

605
00:44:17,489 --> 00:44:19,032
What other two?

606
00:44:26,331 --> 00:44:27,583
They're not human.

607
00:44:30,419 --> 00:44:31,503
How'd you meet them?

608
00:44:37,092 --> 00:44:39,386
There's this
video store near my house.

609
00:44:40,262 --> 00:44:41,862
They've got this basement
where they keep

610
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:44,933
some of the more
specialized stuff.

611
00:44:46,393 --> 00:44:47,936
Always came in together.

612
00:44:49,605 --> 00:44:52,065
You wouldn't really notice
them unless they spoke to you.

613
00:44:52,733 --> 00:44:55,903
<i>One of them had</i> a <i>beard,
or</i> a <i>goatee.</i>

614
00:44:56,778 --> 00:44:59,781
The other one smiled a lot.
He did all the talking.

615
00:45:00,532 --> 00:45:01,533
What about names?

616
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:04,953
You don't exchange names
in a place like that.

617
00:45:05,579 --> 00:45:06,622
Not real ones anyway.

618
00:45:07,289 --> 00:45:10,876
They loved that I worked in a cemetery.
Thought it was funny.

619
00:45:10,959 --> 00:45:11,960
Wanted to buy me drinks.

620
00:45:13,545 --> 00:45:16,048
So we went to this bar
in the middle of the day.

621
00:45:16,131 --> 00:45:17,883
Drank rum and Coke.

622
00:45:17,966 --> 00:45:20,219
Talked about the different
videos we liked.

623
00:45:20,302 --> 00:45:22,387
It was all one
big laugh to them,

624
00:45:22,471 --> 00:45:25,057
watching all the drug addicts
fuck each other.

625
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:27,434
They were, like, obsessed
with that whole world.

626
00:45:27,643 --> 00:45:30,020
Dealers, addicts,
different kinds of drugs.

627
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,460
They told me they
worked with the DEA.

628
00:45:33,857 --> 00:45:34,858
They were cops?

629
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:36,485
They wouldn't say for sure.

630
00:45:37,819 --> 00:45:39,321
They said what
they did was secret.

631
00:45:41,448 --> 00:45:43,617
But they had one of those
police radios, you know?

632
00:45:44,326 --> 00:45:46,203
One of those handheld units.

633
00:45:46,286 --> 00:45:49,665
And they had all these files on drug
dealers with DEA stamps on them.

634
00:45:49,873 --> 00:45:51,750
Told me they worked on
special assignments.

635
00:45:52,209 --> 00:45:53,335
You told them about Reuben.

636
00:45:53,961 --> 00:45:55,921
I told them about Leila.

637
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:58,507
About how I wanted to
save her from Reuben.

638
00:45:59,299 --> 00:46:01,551
So we came up here.
We watched them for a while.

639
00:46:03,303 --> 00:46:05,514
They said they wanted
to help her, too.

640
00:46:06,515 --> 00:46:08,433
So you followed her?

641
00:46:08,517 --> 00:46:09,797
You picked her up
off the street.

642
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,521
Then what?

643
00:46:12,688 --> 00:46:15,857
We drove around with her.
We finally parked somewhere.

644
00:46:16,066 --> 00:46:17,317
Near the water in Brooklyn.

645
00:46:17,734 --> 00:46:19,736
Said they wanted to
make their own video.

646
00:46:20,696 --> 00:46:22,030
She was really scared.

647
00:46:22,239 --> 00:46:23,365
They loved that.

648
00:46:31,331 --> 00:46:33,208
You dirty little girl.

649
00:46:36,837 --> 00:46:38,213
They kept talking to her.

650
00:46:38,547 --> 00:46:40,215
Pick one.
Which one's your favorite?

651
00:46:40,507 --> 00:46:42,301
Eeny, meeny, miney, moe.

652
00:46:42,384 --> 00:46:45,429
You pick the one that you want to
keep, and I'll take the other.

653
00:46:45,929 --> 00:46:49,558
One for you, one for me.
That's fair, isn't it?

654
00:46:50,183 --> 00:46:52,936
Well, you better pick one, or
I'm going to take them both.

655
00:46:53,437 --> 00:46:56,356
Come on, what are you waiting for?
You trying to stall?

656
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:57,607
You trying to make me mad?

657
00:46:58,025 --> 00:47:00,193
Touch the one that
you want to keep.

658
00:47:00,527 --> 00:47:01,528
This one?

659
00:47:01,903 --> 00:47:02,904
Okay, good.

660
00:47:03,238 --> 00:47:04,781
I think that's
an excellent choice.

661
00:47:04,906 --> 00:47:08,618
Okay, that's ones yours,
and this one is mine.

662
00:47:09,244 --> 00:47:12,080
A deal's a deal.
No take backsies.

663
00:47:17,919 --> 00:47:19,504
But then two days later,

664
00:47:19,588 --> 00:47:21,108
I think they thought
it would be funny,

665
00:47:21,214 --> 00:47:24,092
I show up for work and there's
garbage bags everywhere.

666
00:47:25,135 --> 00:47:27,137
They knew I'd
never say anything.

667
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:29,222
Where was this video place
you met these two?

668
00:47:29,431 --> 00:47:30,724
It moves around a lot.

669
00:47:30,932 --> 00:47:32,351
Might still be there. Who knows?

670
00:47:32,434 --> 00:47:33,435
How do I get in?

671
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:34,936
It helps if they know you.

672
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:36,563
What if you come with me?

673
00:47:41,651 --> 00:47:43,695
Can I feed my birds first?

674
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:02,923
Ray.

675
00:48:03,465 --> 00:48:04,841
What was that?

676
00:48:06,927 --> 00:48:08,387
That was his name.

677
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:10,972
Which one?
The quiet one, or the...

678
00:48:16,812 --> 00:48:17,938
Jesus.

679
00:48:25,278 --> 00:48:28,907
I was off-duty one day in this
bar in Washington Heights

680
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:31,326
where cops didn't have
to pay for their drinks.

681
00:48:32,494 --> 00:48:35,122
And a couple of guys came in
to rob the place.

682
00:48:36,164 --> 00:48:38,875
I chased them into the street,
shot two dead,

683
00:48:39,876 --> 00:48:42,003
got a third one in the leg.

684
00:48:42,671 --> 00:48:44,297
He'll never walk right again.

685
00:48:46,299 --> 00:48:48,593
Yeah. I quit drinking that day.

686
00:48:50,846 --> 00:48:54,391
It just wasn't as
much fun after that.

687
00:49:58,914 --> 00:50:01,750
People are afraid
of all the wrong things.

688
00:50:31,112 --> 00:50:32,405
I'll be right back.

689
00:51:29,504 --> 00:51:32,007
I wonder if he'd pay
as much for the nurse?

690
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,844
We made a mistake.
Come on, let's go.

691
00:51:42,309 --> 00:51:43,310
Wait, wait.

692
00:52:34,944 --> 00:52:36,946
They work for the fucking DEA?

693
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:40,116
Probably not for very long and
almost certainly not as agents.

694
00:52:40,241 --> 00:52:41,241
Then what were they?

695
00:52:41,284 --> 00:52:42,327
I don't know.

696
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:44,287
Maybe they were used as
confidential informants

697
00:52:44,371 --> 00:52:45,872
or maybe they were office staff.

698
00:52:45,955 --> 00:52:47,499
Whatever they were,
they couldn't have

699
00:52:47,582 --> 00:52:49,334
gone very far
or lasted very long.

700
00:52:49,417 --> 00:52:52,170
Why not? Because they're insane.

701
00:52:52,253 --> 00:52:54,172
They managed to get
their hands on some files.

702
00:52:54,255 --> 00:52:55,590
One of which had my name on it.

703
00:52:55,882 --> 00:52:57,634
And if my name's on a DEA file,

704
00:52:57,717 --> 00:52:58,927
that means I'm being
looked at, right?

705
00:52:59,094 --> 00:53:00,637
Or you were at one time.

706
00:53:01,888 --> 00:53:03,973
You know a lot of people,
do what you do?

707
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:08,770
It's not like we have a union or
anything, but I know a few. Why?

708
00:53:08,895 --> 00:53:11,439
I want you to call them and tell
them what happened to Carrie.

709
00:53:11,564 --> 00:53:12,524
Tell them you've hired a...

710
00:53:12,607 --> 00:53:14,150
Are you fucking kidding me?

711
00:53:14,651 --> 00:53:16,531
Word gets out about Carrie,
cops are gonna be...

712
00:53:16,611 --> 00:53:18,154
They've done this before.

713
00:53:18,238 --> 00:53:19,614
And they're gonna do it again.

714
00:53:19,739 --> 00:53:21,282
This time I wanna hear about it.

715
00:53:21,908 --> 00:53:23,118
What do I say?

716
00:53:24,077 --> 00:53:25,537
You'll think of something.

717
00:53:27,122 --> 00:53:28,289
I could have paid them.

718
00:53:30,458 --> 00:53:31,835
I had the whole million.

719
00:53:34,087 --> 00:53:35,171
It was our nest egg.

720
00:53:35,255 --> 00:53:37,424
You know, the money I was
gonna use to get out.

721
00:53:37,507 --> 00:53:40,427
And this guy I know, he was gonna
put me into some Internet startup,

722
00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:42,178
sell shoes online
or some bullshit.

723
00:53:42,303 --> 00:53:44,597
It was our future and I didn't
want to give it to them.

724
00:53:44,681 --> 00:53:46,433
Now how fucking stupid is that?

725
00:53:46,808 --> 00:53:48,101
She was already dead.

726
00:53:49,144 --> 00:53:51,813
If she wasn't, they would
have killed her anyway.

727
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:53,857
Call your friends.

728
00:54:46,993 --> 00:54:48,036
Gotteskind?

729
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:50,955
I just knew her as Marie.

730
00:54:51,664 --> 00:54:53,708
Jacinto. My man.

731
00:54:54,876 --> 00:54:56,503
You know where it is.

732
00:54:59,172 --> 00:55:00,548
She lived around here?

733
00:55:01,549 --> 00:55:02,634
She worked around here.

734
00:55:02,717 --> 00:55:03,760
Where?

735
00:55:03,927 --> 00:55:05,178
On the corner.

736
00:55:06,179 --> 00:55:08,598
No, no, your mama likes the
one percent, not the two.

737
00:55:10,517 --> 00:55:11,601
She was a dealer?

738
00:55:11,768 --> 00:55:12,769
Shh.

739
00:55:14,395 --> 00:55:16,481
She worked out of a crib
not too far from here,

740
00:55:16,564 --> 00:55:17,899
if you know what I mean.

741
00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:28,618
See that old building
down the block

742
00:55:28,701 --> 00:55:30,286
with the vacuum repair
on the ground?

743
00:56:45,028 --> 00:56:46,029
Hola.

744
00:56:48,489 --> 00:56:49,908
All right, tell me, cocksucker,

745
00:56:49,991 --> 00:56:51,409
what do you want with Marie G?

746
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:56,831
You on the job, fucker?

747
00:56:57,373 --> 00:56:58,374
Retired.

748
00:56:58,458 --> 00:57:00,126
Who you working for, the family?

749
00:57:00,752 --> 00:57:03,546
Shit. When are you guys
gonna leave it alone, huh?

750
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:04,672
We didn't do it, okay?

751
00:57:04,756 --> 00:57:05,757
Okay.

752
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,133
You think we'd
just chop up a cop

753
00:57:07,216 --> 00:57:09,093
and leave her on our
own fucking doorstep?

754
00:57:09,177 --> 00:57:11,638
My son's a fucking moron
but he's not an idiot.

755
00:57:13,306 --> 00:57:14,641
Wait. Marie was a cop?

756
00:57:16,142 --> 00:57:17,143
Who are you?

757
00:57:18,102 --> 00:57:20,521
I'm not after you. Or your son.

758
00:57:22,857 --> 00:57:24,108
I want...

759
00:57:26,611 --> 00:57:29,155
I want the guys
that killed Marie.

760
00:57:29,238 --> 00:57:30,823
Not if I kill 'em first.

761
00:57:32,492 --> 00:57:34,285
You dealing outta the store?

762
00:57:34,369 --> 00:57:35,370
Not anymore.

763
00:57:36,579 --> 00:57:38,164
But she was working you?

764
00:57:38,873 --> 00:57:41,417
Working him?

765
00:57:41,501 --> 00:57:42,961
Fucking moron
wanted to marry her.

766
00:57:43,836 --> 00:57:45,296
That's how good she was.

767
00:57:54,555 --> 00:57:56,349
Hello, my name's Peter.

768
00:57:56,933 --> 00:58:00,144
I'm an alcoholic
and still a drug addict,

769
00:58:00,228 --> 00:58:01,771
and I got one day back.

770
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:03,064
Hi, Peter.

771
00:58:03,272 --> 00:58:05,650
It's good to see all
the friendly faces again.

772
00:58:05,733 --> 00:58:07,944
Still haven't managed
to turn your back on me.

773
00:58:10,613 --> 00:58:11,698
So I slipped, you know?

774
00:58:11,781 --> 00:58:12,991
It happens.

775
00:58:13,074 --> 00:58:15,243
The funny thing is I didn't
start using until I was 28.

776
00:58:15,326 --> 00:58:16,327
Yeah?

777
00:58:16,411 --> 00:58:18,204
Up until then,
I never even smoked a joint.

778
00:58:18,287 --> 00:58:19,747
Even when I was overseas,
you know,

779
00:58:19,831 --> 00:58:21,457
half my unit was on
one thing or another.

780
00:58:21,541 --> 00:58:22,834
You were in the army?

781
00:58:22,917 --> 00:58:24,919
Yeah, I was in Germany,
then Desert Storm.

782
00:58:25,586 --> 00:58:27,672
I come home, go back to school,

783
00:58:27,755 --> 00:58:29,115
and me and Kenny,
we start dealing.

784
00:58:30,174 --> 00:58:32,510
Just enough to get by.
It was more Kenny's thing.

785
00:58:33,928 --> 00:58:35,138
He was dealing in college.

786
00:58:35,221 --> 00:58:36,681
I do it to pay for art school.

787
00:58:36,764 --> 00:58:38,349
Wind up getting
hooked on the product.

788
00:58:38,433 --> 00:58:39,642
Drop out.

789
00:58:39,726 --> 00:58:41,436
Meanwhile, Kenny,
he stays in the business,

790
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:43,104
starts making some real money

791
00:58:43,187 --> 00:58:46,441
while I'm eating garbage and
sleeping in abandoned buildings.

792
00:58:46,524 --> 00:58:49,819
Till one night I nearly blew my fucking
heart out of my mouth up in Harlem.

793
00:58:49,902 --> 00:58:51,070
What are you gonna do now?

794
00:58:51,738 --> 00:58:54,157
I got this job as a breadmaker.

795
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:56,909
Figure stay busy at night,
sleep during the day.

796
00:58:56,993 --> 00:58:58,244
Get in less trouble.

797
00:59:00,538 --> 00:59:01,789
All right. See you around.

798
00:59:01,873 --> 00:59:02,874
Take it easy.

799
00:59:03,041 --> 00:59:06,085
The number you have reached is
not in service. Please check...

800
00:59:08,296 --> 00:59:09,338
Directory assistance.

801
00:59:09,464 --> 00:59:13,217
I'd like the number for the
East Village Plumbing, please.

802
00:59:13,301 --> 00:59:14,301
What borough?

803
00:59:14,343 --> 00:59:15,720
I assume it's the East Village.

804
00:59:15,803 --> 00:59:16,888
One moment.

805
00:59:17,638 --> 00:59:19,599
No listing in Manhattan.
Try Brooklyn.

806
00:59:20,433 --> 00:59:21,642
Nothing in Brooklyn either.

807
00:59:21,726 --> 00:59:22,894
Try all the boroughs.

808
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:25,760
I 'm sorry, we have no listing.

809
00:59:25,813 --> 00:59:26,981
Thanks.

810
00:59:48,711 --> 00:59:49,962
What happened to you?

811
00:59:50,046 --> 00:59:51,839
I bumped into something.
You okay?

812
00:59:53,007 --> 00:59:54,008
I'm fine.

813
00:59:54,759 --> 00:59:56,761
What you got there in your backpack?
Nothing.

814
00:59:57,011 --> 00:59:59,889
Just my notebook.
Some Twizzlers.

815
00:59:59,972 --> 01:00:01,652
Unless you're talking
about my pencil case.

816
01:00:01,849 --> 01:00:04,769
No. I'm talking about the black
Beretta with the taped grip

817
01:00:04,852 --> 01:00:06,437
you got tucked beside
your water bottle.

818
01:00:06,687 --> 01:00:07,688
Oh.

819
01:00:08,856 --> 01:00:09,857
You mean this.

820
01:00:10,399 --> 01:00:11,484
My newjammie.

821
01:00:14,403 --> 01:00:15,530
It's a nice one.

822
01:00:15,613 --> 01:00:17,281
What are you planning
on doing with it?

823
01:00:17,365 --> 01:00:19,867
I don't know, man. Right now
it's just for protection.

824
01:00:19,951 --> 01:00:23,329
Figure, I'm gonna be a
detective, I need a piece.

825
01:00:23,496 --> 01:00:25,414
Mmm-hmm. Where'd you get it?

826
01:00:25,498 --> 01:00:27,625
I was just taking
a nap in some alley.

827
01:00:28,334 --> 01:00:30,628
Heard some footsteps.
I seen some dude who works

828
01:00:30,711 --> 01:00:32,255
as a lookout for some ballers.

829
01:00:32,338 --> 01:00:34,882
He just threw the bag
in a dumpster and split.

830
01:00:35,883 --> 01:00:37,426
You stole someone's stash?

831
01:00:38,427 --> 01:00:41,389
I didn't steal it. I left the
money and the rock where it was.

832
01:00:42,723 --> 01:00:45,017
They're going to come back for
the piece, you know that.

833
01:00:45,101 --> 01:00:48,187
Naw. They're in the wind,
Matthew. Trust me.

834
01:00:48,896 --> 01:00:50,648
Cops clipped their ass.

835
01:00:52,108 --> 01:00:53,693
You know how to use that?

836
01:00:54,694 --> 01:00:55,903
Shit.

837
01:00:57,196 --> 01:00:59,323
Point it at me.
Like you're gonna shoot me.

838
01:01:00,783 --> 01:01:01,951
Go ahead.

839
01:01:03,244 --> 01:01:04,245
Come on.

840
01:01:07,957 --> 01:01:09,167
That the way you hold a gun?

841
01:01:10,084 --> 01:01:11,544
That's the way I hold it, yeah.

842
01:01:12,336 --> 01:01:15,381
You know how to jack the clip?
Empty it? Clean it?

843
01:01:20,678 --> 01:01:23,598
But the gun's still not empty.
You know that, right?

844
01:01:24,432 --> 01:01:26,632
You know there's still a round
left in the chamber here?

845
01:01:27,393 --> 01:01:28,644
Now. Put it back together.

846
01:01:36,819 --> 01:01:37,820
Caress it.

847
01:01:37,945 --> 01:01:39,780
Rub it, like it's part of you.

848
01:01:42,325 --> 01:01:43,868
Feels good, doesn't it?

849
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:45,661
Word.

850
01:01:46,037 --> 01:01:47,496
It's all oily and whatnot.

851
01:01:48,122 --> 01:01:49,290
Turn off the safety.

852
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:53,961
Now cock it.

853
01:01:59,342 --> 01:02:02,303
Now put it to your temple
and pull the fucking trigger.

854
01:02:03,763 --> 01:02:05,097
What? You heard me.

855
01:02:05,723 --> 01:02:07,058
Shoot yourself in the head.

856
01:02:07,308 --> 01:02:08,893
Might as well get
it over with now.

857
01:02:09,227 --> 01:02:10,686
Because you walk
around with a gun,

858
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:13,356
sooner or later,
it's gonna happen anyway.

859
01:02:13,439 --> 01:02:17,276
No rewind. No going out for popcorn
and coming back to the show.

860
01:02:17,902 --> 01:02:21,697
It's just you with that gun in your
hand, stupid look on your face,

861
01:02:21,781 --> 01:02:23,157
and your hash all over the wall.

862
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:27,328
Take it easy now, TJ.

863
01:03:16,544 --> 01:03:17,586
Ahh!

864
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:18,671
Fuck!

865
01:03:24,343 --> 01:03:26,637
Scudder, I'm assuming you're not

866
01:03:26,721 --> 01:03:28,161
dumb enough to shoot
a federal agent.

867
01:03:28,306 --> 01:03:29,640
Show me your badge. Right now.

868
01:03:29,724 --> 01:03:30,725
Okay.

869
01:03:30,808 --> 01:03:32,226
I'm reaching for my folder.

870
01:03:34,854 --> 01:03:37,189
Stover. Drug Enforcement.

871
01:03:37,898 --> 01:03:38,899
Put it down.

872
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:41,527
Great. It's broken.

873
01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:43,112
Next time identify yourself.

874
01:03:43,195 --> 01:03:44,530
Hey, maybe we should pull over,

875
01:03:44,613 --> 01:03:47,213
try again this time without the
sucker punch, see how well you do.

876
01:03:47,325 --> 01:03:48,326
Why wait?

877
01:03:48,826 --> 01:03:49,952
Hey, that's enough.

878
01:03:50,953 --> 01:03:52,455
Who you working for?
Kenny Kristo?

879
01:03:52,913 --> 01:03:54,832
I can't say.
Cut it out, Scudder.

880
01:03:55,207 --> 01:03:57,501
You're not licensed
so you don't have privilege.

881
01:03:57,585 --> 01:03:58,586
And you're retired,

882
01:03:58,669 --> 01:04:00,880
so this gives you about
as much legal authority

883
01:04:00,963 --> 01:04:02,131
as a fucking mailman.

884
01:04:03,257 --> 01:04:04,592
So the sooner you
tell me what you're doing

885
01:04:04,675 --> 01:04:05,968
hanging with known drug dealers,

886
01:04:06,052 --> 01:04:08,492
the sooner you can get to an AA
meeting and not talk about it.

887
01:04:08,804 --> 01:04:11,390
I'm trying to find Ray and
his buddy what's-his-name.

888
01:04:11,891 --> 01:04:14,226
You know, the two guys
that killed Marie Gotteskind?

889
01:04:14,518 --> 01:04:15,561
I don't know who you mean.

890
01:04:15,770 --> 01:04:17,188
Really? They go around saying

891
01:04:17,271 --> 01:04:19,231
they're on the DEA payroll.

892
01:04:19,315 --> 01:04:22,068
Usually right before they chop
someone into little pieces.

893
01:04:22,318 --> 01:04:24,195
Was Gotteskind
looking at Kenny Kristo?

894
01:04:24,278 --> 01:04:25,279
I can't answer that.

895
01:04:25,613 --> 01:04:27,281
Maybe Mrs. Kristo can.

896
01:04:27,740 --> 01:04:30,493
Although we haven't seen her
around for a while, have we, guys?

897
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:32,370
I know,

898
01:04:32,453 --> 01:04:35,081
maybe you should talk
to the brother, Peter.

899
01:04:35,164 --> 01:04:37,541
Seeing as he used to spend
a lot of time over there.

900
01:04:38,709 --> 01:04:39,710
Know what?

901
01:04:40,419 --> 01:04:41,587
I was wrong.

902
01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:44,131
This guy doesn't know
a fucking thing. Uncuff him.

903
01:04:45,758 --> 01:04:47,343
We're done here.

904
01:05:20,292 --> 01:05:22,420
In the program,
they have this saying.

905
01:05:23,337 --> 01:05:25,756
"Don't give up five minutes
before the miracle happens."

906
01:05:26,048 --> 01:05:27,049
Scudden.

907
01:05:27,508 --> 01:05:28,759
Of course the flip
side of that one is,

908
01:05:28,843 --> 01:05:30,845
if you do give up,
you'll never know.

909
01:05:31,053 --> 01:05:32,054
What are you doing here?

910
01:05:36,434 --> 01:05:38,519
I'm admiring your wallpaper. Oh.

911
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:42,773
Those are the studies
I was doing for the painting.

912
01:05:43,023 --> 01:05:44,024
You do them all here?

913
01:05:44,108 --> 01:05:45,443
Yeah. We had to.

914
01:05:45,526 --> 01:05:48,154
Wanted it to be
a surprise for Kenny.

915
01:05:48,404 --> 01:05:50,656
Was he? Surprised?

916
01:05:52,116 --> 01:05:53,159
What do you want, man?

917
01:05:54,076 --> 01:05:55,703
You and Carrie put the DEA

918
01:05:55,786 --> 01:05:56,986
onto your brother, didn't you?

919
01:05:57,663 --> 01:05:58,664
Hey.

920
01:05:58,831 --> 01:06:01,167
I wouldn't blame you
for hating the guy. I mean,

921
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:03,294
it's not just that
he has a beautiful wife,

922
01:06:03,377 --> 01:06:05,337
it's not just that
he's got all that money,

923
01:06:05,421 --> 01:06:09,008
while you work some get-well
job making donuts.

924
01:06:09,091 --> 01:06:11,051
What would really get me

925
01:06:11,844 --> 01:06:13,929
is how he can be
around all thatjunk

926
01:06:15,055 --> 01:06:16,223
and never use.

927
01:06:19,185 --> 01:06:21,061
Carrie had
nothing to do with it.

928
01:06:25,774 --> 01:06:29,195
About nine months ago, they go to
Bermuda for their anniversary.

929
01:06:30,529 --> 01:06:32,740
Carrie asked me
to watch the house.

930
01:06:34,158 --> 01:06:35,451
I'm there maybe a day.

931
01:06:36,410 --> 01:06:38,579
Found some cash Kenny
hadn't locked up.

932
01:06:38,662 --> 01:06:40,247
I don't even think about it.

933
01:06:40,331 --> 01:06:42,958
I go to Queens,
to this guy I know to score.

934
01:06:43,209 --> 01:06:44,376
And you get busted?

935
01:06:44,710 --> 01:06:47,713
Yeah. I get put in a room
with this woman DEA agent.

936
01:06:49,798 --> 01:06:51,509
She's so nice to me, you know.

937
01:06:52,676 --> 01:06:54,053
I give Kenny up like that.

938
01:06:54,345 --> 01:06:56,785
Of course, it didn't help that
you were in love with his wife.

939
01:06:57,765 --> 01:07:00,643
Sometimes I think Kenny left
that money out on purpose.

940
01:07:01,227 --> 01:07:03,771
Yeah.
I'm sure that's what he did.

941
01:07:05,689 --> 01:07:09,276
I'm sure this is all exactly
what he wanted to happen.

942
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:10,736
What are you talking about?

943
01:07:10,819 --> 01:07:13,280
That agent that busted you,
the nice one,

944
01:07:14,365 --> 01:07:16,200
her name was Marie Gotteskind.

945
01:07:18,202 --> 01:07:20,162
She was killed by the same
two men who got Carrie.

946
01:07:21,121 --> 01:07:22,206
How did they know about that...

947
01:07:22,289 --> 01:07:23,290
They stole her files.

948
01:07:23,666 --> 01:07:25,918
And one of them, thanks to
you, had Kenny's name in it.

949
01:07:31,715 --> 01:07:33,342
Tell your brother I'm done.

950
01:07:34,051 --> 01:07:35,886
I'll return his money tomorrow.

951
01:07:36,554 --> 01:07:38,180
Does Kenny know about me?

952
01:07:38,806 --> 01:07:40,140
Not unless you tell him.

953
01:07:51,151 --> 01:07:52,152
MAN 13 Y0.

954
01:07:52,236 --> 01:07:53,676
There goes his
bitch-ass right there.

955
01:07:54,238 --> 01:07:55,614
Roll up next to him, man.

956
01:07:55,698 --> 01:07:58,701
Yo, TJ! Feeling those new
Timbs you're rocking, man.

957
01:07:59,243 --> 01:08:01,078
I know you hear me
talking to you, right?

958
01:08:01,161 --> 01:08:02,663
Let's go fuck this boy up.

959
01:08:06,458 --> 01:08:08,961
Yo, slow your ass down! Whoa, whoa!
What's up? What's up?

960
01:08:09,461 --> 01:08:11,261
Yo, you got something
that belongs to me, man.

961
01:08:11,297 --> 01:08:12,298
What you all talking about, man?

962
01:08:12,381 --> 01:08:14,221
Where my Gat at, man?
That's my favorite piece!

963
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:15,509
Man, lthrew it in the
fucking river, man. I...

964
01:08:15,593 --> 01:08:16,594
What?

965
01:08:16,677 --> 01:08:17,803
Serious, man?

966
01:08:17,886 --> 01:08:19,606
The fuck you mean you
threw it in the river?

967
01:08:19,638 --> 01:08:21,432
Where you going?
We just want to talk to you.

968
01:08:21,515 --> 01:08:22,516
Get back here, bitch.

969
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:24,184
Yo, run his fucking bag.
Give me that!

970
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:27,730
Yo, what's this cartoon shit?

971
01:08:27,896 --> 01:08:28,981
No, no, no!

972
01:08:29,273 --> 01:08:30,274
No, man, that's my... Shutup!

973
01:08:30,357 --> 01:08:31,400
Yo, where you get
this money from?

974
01:08:31,567 --> 01:08:32,985
It's my allowance!
You sell my Gat?

975
01:08:33,068 --> 01:08:34,695
No! Yo, take his fucking
Timbs off, man.

976
01:08:35,362 --> 01:08:36,447
No, man.

977
01:08:36,905 --> 01:08:38,240
What the fuck? Yo, motherfucker!

978
01:08:38,324 --> 01:08:40,244
Fuck, I'm going to kill his bitch ass!
Fucking A!

979
01:08:40,576 --> 01:08:42,696
What's wrong with you? You crazy?
You outta your mind?

980
01:08:45,914 --> 01:08:46,957
Any messages?

981
01:08:47,708 --> 01:08:48,709
Um...

982
01:08:49,543 --> 01:08:50,544
Yeah. JR called.

983
01:08:50,669 --> 01:08:51,670
TJ?

984
01:08:52,463 --> 01:08:53,797
Yeah, whatever.

985
01:08:53,881 --> 01:08:54,965
Did he leave a message?

986
01:08:55,674 --> 01:08:57,635
Let me think. No.

987
01:08:58,427 --> 01:08:59,428
Well, yeah.

988
01:08:59,803 --> 01:09:00,804
He's at Bellevue.

989
01:09:03,432 --> 01:09:04,850
He got worked over pretty good.

990
01:09:05,184 --> 01:09:06,769
But he was also out in the rain.

991
01:09:07,061 --> 01:09:08,145
Either one could have
triggered the crisis.

992
01:09:08,228 --> 01:09:09,229
Crisis?

993
01:09:09,355 --> 01:09:10,356
He's a sickler.

994
01:09:11,106 --> 01:09:12,733
He's got sickle cell anemia.

995
01:09:13,609 --> 01:09:15,194
You didn't know that? No.

996
01:09:15,277 --> 01:09:17,696
Well, a sickler
gets a cold or a chill.

997
01:09:17,780 --> 01:09:20,616
Anything that makes a normal
person's blood cell count go up,

998
01:09:20,741 --> 01:09:22,826
any time the body gets
ready to fight something,

999
01:09:22,910 --> 01:09:24,286
the red blood cells panic,

1000
01:09:24,370 --> 01:09:25,954
and they take on a sickle shape.

1001
01:09:26,038 --> 01:09:27,598
Actually create
a kind of a traffic: Jam

1002
01:09:27,665 --> 01:09:28,999
in the arteries.

1003
01:09:29,083 --> 01:09:30,542
The blood gets very thick.

1004
01:09:30,668 --> 01:09:32,252
Suddenly, you're not
getting any oxygen.

1005
01:09:32,419 --> 01:09:33,504
What are you doing for him?

1006
01:09:33,921 --> 01:09:34,922
Well,

1007
01:09:35,172 --> 01:09:37,508
we're hydrating him, giving
him Demerol for the pain.

1008
01:09:37,591 --> 01:09:38,634
But he knew the drill.

1009
01:09:38,717 --> 01:09:40,477
He got in here early enough,
so I don't think

1010
01:09:40,552 --> 01:09:42,179
it'll go on for too long.

1011
01:09:42,262 --> 01:09:43,681
I'll be right out there
if you need me.

1012
01:09:43,764 --> 01:09:45,140
Thanks, doctor.

1013
01:09:58,070 --> 01:09:59,571
Don't feel sorry for me.

1014
01:10:00,906 --> 01:10:01,907
I don't.

1015
01:10:05,953 --> 01:10:07,579
How long I gotta
be here for, man?

1016
01:10:07,705 --> 01:10:09,415
Depends how well you behave.

1017
01:10:11,333 --> 01:10:14,420
You know, my mom told me once
that I got special blood.

1018
01:10:14,503 --> 01:10:16,046
That I can never catch malaria.

1019
01:10:16,714 --> 01:10:18,632
That's how sickle cell
got started.

1020
01:10:18,716 --> 01:10:20,676
In Africa.
As a defense against malaria.

1021
01:10:21,176 --> 01:10:22,594
Where is your mother, TJ?

1022
01:10:23,804 --> 01:10:25,222
Why aren't you a cop no more?

1023
01:10:25,305 --> 01:10:26,306
You first.

1024
01:10:30,227 --> 01:10:33,731
I had a crisis one time.
I was about 11.

1025
01:10:33,814 --> 01:10:35,441
My mom took me to the hospital,

1026
01:10:35,524 --> 01:10:38,026
but never came back
to check me out.

1027
01:10:38,110 --> 01:10:39,737
I guess she thought
that if she left me there

1028
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:42,573
they'd put me with
a really nice family.

1029
01:10:42,656 --> 01:10:43,949
Little did she know.

1030
01:10:44,867 --> 01:10:49,621
I saw her in the street a few times
after that, but that was a while ago.

1031
01:10:50,664 --> 01:10:52,166
She had some issues then.

1032
01:10:53,459 --> 01:10:54,543
Your turn.

1033
01:10:55,711 --> 01:10:57,588
I was off duty one day.

1034
01:10:58,756 --> 01:11:00,758
I was in a bar in
Washington Heights where

1035
01:11:00,841 --> 01:11:02,509
cops didn't have to
pay for their drinks.

1036
01:11:02,593 --> 01:11:03,594
Wait a minute.

1037
01:11:03,927 --> 01:11:05,804
Three kids held up the place.

1038
01:11:07,848 --> 01:11:11,226
On their way out, they shot
the bartender in the heart.

1039
01:11:11,310 --> 01:11:13,270
I chased them out
into the street,

1040
01:11:14,438 --> 01:11:17,483
and I shot two dead, caught
the other one in the thigh.

1041
01:11:17,649 --> 01:11:19,193
I heard this already. No.

1042
01:11:19,401 --> 01:11:20,527
You didn't.

1043
01:11:22,279 --> 01:11:23,280
You see,

1044
01:11:24,031 --> 01:11:25,032
one shot...

1045
01:11:25,532 --> 01:11:28,035
Well, the bullet took a bad hop.

1046
01:11:48,722 --> 01:11:50,891
It hit a 7-year-old girl
in the eye.

1047
01:11:52,059 --> 01:11:53,393
Killed her instantly.

1048
01:11:54,144 --> 01:11:56,188
An inch higher and it would
have grazed her head.

1049
01:11:56,897 --> 01:11:58,857
Left a nasty scar. That's all.

1050
01:11:59,191 --> 01:12:01,193
So wait, they quit your ass

1051
01:12:01,276 --> 01:12:03,278
after you took on
three bangers by yourself?

1052
01:12:04,321 --> 01:12:07,866
They gave me a commendation.
I quit my own ass.

1053
01:12:09,409 --> 01:12:11,328
I never met anybody
that tight before.

1054
01:12:11,745 --> 01:12:12,913
Tight?

1055
01:12:12,996 --> 01:12:13,997
Brave.

1056
01:12:15,916 --> 01:12:17,084
I wasn't brave.

1057
01:12:19,419 --> 01:12:20,754
I was just drunk.

1058
01:12:23,924 --> 01:12:25,509
Don't feel sorry for me.

1059
01:12:28,887 --> 01:12:30,013
I don't.

1060
01:12:36,770 --> 01:12:38,230
Now, please.

1061
01:13:19,938 --> 01:13:20,981
Watson?

1062
01:13:38,665 --> 01:13:39,875
Watson?

1063
01:13:49,092 --> 01:13:50,093
Shh.

1064
01:14:12,908 --> 01:14:14,701
You don't know
how lucky you are.

1065
01:14:24,544 --> 01:14:25,545
Scudden.

1066
01:14:42,062 --> 01:14:43,063
Hello?

1067
01:14:48,068 --> 01:14:49,069
Kenny?

1068
01:14:52,948 --> 01:14:54,074
Anybody home?

1069
01:15:04,918 --> 01:15:06,128
And where've you been?

1070
01:15:08,463 --> 01:15:09,464
Hmm?

1071
01:15:09,631 --> 01:15:11,508
Been trying to call you.
Where's Kenny?

1072
01:15:11,842 --> 01:15:13,135
Whitestone.

1073
01:15:13,218 --> 01:15:14,720
With a friend who
says he's having

1074
01:15:14,803 --> 01:15:16,680
the same kind of
problem as Kenny had.

1075
01:15:16,930 --> 01:15:17,931
The wife?

1076
01:15:18,598 --> 01:15:19,599
Worse.

1077
01:15:26,857 --> 01:15:28,400
I don't got that kind of money.

1078
01:15:33,697 --> 01:15:34,823
You're the detective?

1079
01:15:34,906 --> 01:15:35,949
Matt Scudder.

1080
01:15:36,283 --> 01:15:39,786
Hello. Dani, why don't you go
outside and keep an eye out.

1081
01:15:39,870 --> 01:15:41,079
That's a good boy.

1082
01:15:43,123 --> 01:15:44,875
Now I post guards.

1083
01:15:45,375 --> 01:15:49,379
The horse is stolen, so I lock the barn.
For what? Huh?

1084
01:15:49,671 --> 01:15:52,507
What can they take from me now?
She's 14 years old.

1085
01:15:52,799 --> 01:15:54,593
Fourteen.

1086
01:15:54,676 --> 01:15:56,553
This is Anna, the nurse.

1087
01:15:58,555 --> 01:16:01,892
They took her last night
and call us in the morning

1088
01:16:02,809 --> 01:16:04,519
and tell us not
to call the police.

1089
01:16:05,479 --> 01:16:06,897
I remember Kenny
calling the other day,

1090
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:09,232
so I put two and two together.

1091
01:16:09,357 --> 01:16:12,402
Mr. Landau, listen,
you have to know that...

1092
01:16:12,611 --> 01:16:13,862
I'm sorry,
what's your daughter's name?

1093
01:16:14,029 --> 01:16:16,865
Ludmilla. But she calls
herself Lucia.

1094
01:16:17,824 --> 01:16:19,826
You have to know
that the men who took Lucia

1095
01:16:19,910 --> 01:16:23,497
have already killed at least two
women, including Kenny's wife.

1096
01:16:24,831 --> 01:16:26,083
As things stand,

1097
01:16:26,166 --> 01:16:27,417
they haven't got
the slightest intention

1098
01:16:27,501 --> 01:16:29,503
of releasing
your daughter alive.

1099
01:16:30,504 --> 01:16:31,797
In fact,

1100
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:33,965
there's a strong possibility
that she's already dead.

1101
01:16:34,049 --> 01:16:35,842
No... The police know
about these two.

1102
01:16:36,051 --> 01:16:37,594
They know who they are,
they know what they're doing.

1103
01:16:37,677 --> 01:16:39,012
No, no, no police.

1104
01:16:39,513 --> 01:16:42,432
You have to help me. Kenny
said you would. I'll pay.

1105
01:16:43,141 --> 01:16:44,476
I'll do whatever you ask.

1106
01:16:45,519 --> 01:16:46,686
Please.

1107
01:16:54,861 --> 01:16:55,904
Hello?

1108
01:16:55,987 --> 01:16:58,031
Okay,
you know what happens next?

1109
01:16:58,156 --> 01:17:00,867
Yes, I'm trying.
I'm working on it.

1110
01:17:00,951 --> 01:17:03,370
Well, work harder, Yuri.
We want our money.

1111
01:17:03,495 --> 01:17:04,788
I just need some time, please.

1112
01:17:04,871 --> 01:17:05,956
I'll give you whatever you want,

1113
01:17:06,039 --> 01:17:07,541
but please, the one thing I want

1114
01:17:07,624 --> 01:17:09,024
is to talk to my daughter.
I just...

1115
01:17:09,084 --> 01:17:10,127
She can't talk right now.

1116
01:17:10,210 --> 01:17:11,930
You gotta let me talk to her.
Just let me...

1117
01:17:12,879 --> 01:17:14,714
If she's dead, you get nothing.

1118
01:17:15,298 --> 01:17:17,217
And who the fuck are you?

1119
01:17:17,384 --> 01:17:20,387
I'm the best chance you've got
if you wanna get your money.

1120
01:17:20,804 --> 01:17:22,889
But the girl's gotta be
alive and all in one piece

1121
01:17:22,973 --> 01:17:24,975
for any kind of deal to happen.

1122
01:17:25,225 --> 01:17:27,102
Are you listening, motherfucker?

1123
01:17:28,562 --> 01:17:30,313
Fuck this shit.

1124
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:35,277
I can't believe you
talked to him like that.

1125
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:36,570
He knows what he's doing.

1126
01:17:36,653 --> 01:17:38,738
The important thing right
now is to keep Lucia alive.

1127
01:17:38,905 --> 01:17:40,323
That means
these guys have to know

1128
01:17:40,407 --> 01:17:41,700
that they can't get
a nickel out of you

1129
01:17:41,783 --> 01:17:43,326
until we first know
that she's okay.

1130
01:17:43,410 --> 01:17:45,453
But if you make them mad...
They're already mad.

1131
01:17:45,537 --> 01:17:47,289
But you'll give them
an excuse to kill her.

1132
01:17:47,372 --> 01:17:48,665
They don't need an excuse.

1133
01:17:48,748 --> 01:17:49,948
They're gonna kill her anyway.

1134
01:17:50,584 --> 01:17:52,961
What they need is
a reason to keep her alive.

1135
01:17:53,587 --> 01:17:54,880
How much cash have you got?

1136
01:17:54,963 --> 01:17:56,323
I got damn little
right now, but...

1137
01:17:56,798 --> 01:17:58,175
Do these bastards want cocaine?

1138
01:17:58,258 --> 01:18:00,135
Because I got 15 kilos
10 minutes from here.

1139
01:18:01,595 --> 01:18:02,721
I don't know.

1140
01:18:02,804 --> 01:18:05,557
Maybe I could get my hands on a few
hundred in counterfeit, but...

1141
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:07,350
I can't guarantee the quality,

1142
01:18:07,434 --> 01:18:08,560
and I'd have to return it.

1143
01:18:08,643 --> 01:18:10,937
I got at least
five hundred in cash.

1144
01:18:12,397 --> 01:18:13,815
Time comes, I'll go get it.

1145
01:18:14,274 --> 01:18:15,984
Is there another line I can use?

1146
01:18:16,902 --> 01:18:18,904
There's a phone in
my daughter's room.

1147
01:18:24,826 --> 01:18:27,037
- Culpepper Investigations.
- Daunte speaking.

1148
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:28,121
Where the hell are you?

1149
01:18:28,538 --> 01:18:29,998
I'm in my office, man.
What's up?

1150
01:18:30,248 --> 01:18:31,458
Why'd you leave the hospital?

1151
01:18:31,833 --> 01:18:33,710
I didn't want some
Social Services person

1152
01:18:33,793 --> 01:18:35,629
to come haul my ass
away to a foster home.

1153
01:18:35,712 --> 01:18:36,922
I need you to do me a favor

1154
01:18:37,005 --> 01:18:38,715
and get me something
out of my apartment.

1155
01:18:38,798 --> 01:18:39,841
What's going on?

1156
01:18:40,133 --> 01:18:43,637
There's a box up in my closet.
I want you to get it for me.

1157
01:18:43,762 --> 01:18:45,764
The kid at the front
desk will let you up.

1158
01:18:46,139 --> 01:18:48,516
Apartment 11G.
Key's above the door.

1159
01:18:48,850 --> 01:18:52,229
A guy named Peter will meet you out front.
Give it to him.

1160
01:18:52,312 --> 01:18:54,192
And then go back to whatever
it is you're doing.

1161
01:19:03,365 --> 01:19:04,366
Hello?

1162
01:19:04,616 --> 01:19:06,743
I understand we have
a new player in the game.

1163
01:19:06,826 --> 01:19:08,662
I don't believe
we've been introduced.

1164
01:19:08,954 --> 01:19:11,581
I'm a friend of Mr. Landau's.
My name is not important.

1165
01:19:11,665 --> 01:19:14,876
I'm assuming that Mr. Landau's not
dumb enough to speak to the police.

1166
01:19:15,001 --> 01:19:16,002
He hasn't.

1167
01:19:16,127 --> 01:19:17,128
Then who are you?

1168
01:19:17,504 --> 01:19:19,589
One likes to know
who's on the other side.

1169
01:19:19,673 --> 01:19:22,384
We're on the same side.
We both want this to happen.

1170
01:19:22,467 --> 01:19:24,803
Good. Then all you got to
do is follow instructions.

1171
01:19:24,886 --> 01:19:26,304
No. It's not that simple.

1172
01:19:26,888 --> 01:19:29,266
Of course it is.
We tell you what to do

1173
01:19:29,349 --> 01:19:30,350
and you do it.

1174
01:19:30,475 --> 01:19:31,995
If you ever want to
see the girl again.

1175
01:19:32,185 --> 01:19:34,396
You have to convince me she's
alive in the first place.

1176
01:19:34,562 --> 01:19:35,855
You have my word on that.

1177
01:19:37,691 --> 01:19:38,733
That's funny.

1178
01:19:38,817 --> 01:19:39,897
What, it's not good enough?

1179
01:19:39,985 --> 01:19:41,861
Let's just say you lost
a lot of credibility

1180
01:19:41,945 --> 01:19:44,698
when you returned Mrs.
Kristo in poor condition.

1181
01:19:45,198 --> 01:19:47,784
There were special circumstances
regarding Mrs. Kristo.

1182
01:19:47,867 --> 01:19:49,286
Her husband tried to haggle.

1183
01:19:49,369 --> 01:19:53,164
He sliced the price,
and we in turn...

1184
01:19:53,498 --> 01:19:54,499
Mmm...

1185
01:19:54,874 --> 01:19:57,155
Well, you can finish that thought
for yourself, can't you?

1186
01:19:57,210 --> 01:19:59,004
We're not going
to argue the price.

1187
01:19:59,337 --> 01:20:00,422
You'll pay the million?

1188
01:20:00,922 --> 01:20:02,173
For the girl alive and well.

1189
01:20:02,882 --> 01:20:04,509
I assure you she's both.

1190
01:20:04,718 --> 01:20:06,511
Your assurance means shit to me.

1191
01:20:06,594 --> 01:20:08,555
Put her on the phone,
let her father talk to her.

1192
01:20:08,763 --> 01:20:11,975
Uh, I'm afraid lwon't be able to
put her on the phone right now.

1193
01:20:12,058 --> 01:20:13,560
Please deposit 25 cents...

1194
01:20:13,685 --> 01:20:15,925
Out of quarters? Give me your
number, I'll call you back.

1195
01:20:29,909 --> 01:20:30,910
Yeah?

1196
01:20:31,036 --> 01:20:34,039
I'm afraid the girl cannot come to the
phone. That's out of the question.

1197
01:20:34,372 --> 01:20:37,459
How else can we reassure
you of her wellbeing?

1198
01:20:37,542 --> 01:20:38,626
Wait.

1199
01:20:39,210 --> 01:20:40,890
Tell me something
your daughter would know.

1200
01:20:41,588 --> 01:20:42,589
The dog's name.

1201
01:20:43,089 --> 01:20:45,216
They could know that.
They've been following her.

1202
01:20:45,550 --> 01:20:48,190
They know your schedule. They've
probably seen her walking the dog.

1203
01:20:48,678 --> 01:20:51,639
Heard her call him by name.
Think of something else.

1204
01:20:51,848 --> 01:20:54,351
Yes. We had a dog
before this one.

1205
01:20:54,434 --> 01:20:56,811
A little black-and-white one.
He got hit by a car.

1206
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:01,649
The dog's name. And the name
of the dog before this one.

1207
01:21:01,983 --> 01:21:04,652
Have her describe both of them.
Then call me back.

1208
01:21:49,656 --> 01:21:51,825
The 16 years we were married,

1209
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:55,161
I don't remember her
even having a cold.

1210
01:21:56,329 --> 01:22:00,166
Then one day she wakes up and
says she can't smell anything.

1211
01:22:03,503 --> 01:22:05,088
You were a policeman?

1212
01:22:05,171 --> 01:22:06,881
Yeah, I was.

1213
01:22:07,424 --> 01:22:09,384
You dealt with
situations like this?

1214
01:22:10,593 --> 01:22:12,762
No, not like this.

1215
01:22:12,846 --> 01:22:15,807
Still, your gut must be
telling you something?

1216
01:22:15,890 --> 01:22:18,435
What is it telling you now?
Is she alive?

1217
01:22:25,567 --> 01:22:26,568
Yeah?

1218
01:22:26,651 --> 01:22:29,154
I'd still like to know how
you figure in all this.

1219
01:22:29,821 --> 01:22:31,156
Tell me the dog's name.

1220
01:22:31,573 --> 01:22:33,199
Oh, well, let's see,

1221
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:36,077
what are the old standbys, huh?

1222
01:22:36,578 --> 01:22:39,831
Fido? Towser? King?

1223
01:22:40,165 --> 01:22:41,958
Rover, that's always
a popular choice.

1224
01:22:42,459 --> 01:22:46,129
<i>Hey, I know what it is.
How about Bingo?</i>

1225
01:22:47,088 --> 01:22:48,089
What about Spot, huh?

1226
01:22:48,590 --> 01:22:51,676
"Run, Spot, run!" It's not a
bad name for a Rottweiler.

1227
01:22:52,886 --> 01:22:54,220
The dog's name is Watson.

1228
01:22:54,429 --> 01:22:55,638
Watson.

1229
01:22:57,557 --> 01:22:59,350
And the other dog?
The one before?

1230
01:22:59,642 --> 01:23:01,436
She couldn't tell me what
breed the other dog was.

1231
01:23:01,519 --> 01:23:03,396
She was young when it died.

1232
01:23:04,063 --> 01:23:05,815
They had it put
to sleep, she said.

1233
01:23:05,899 --> 01:23:07,984
It's a silly term for it,
don't you think?

1234
01:23:09,027 --> 01:23:10,111
I mean, you're gonna
kill something

1235
01:23:10,195 --> 01:23:12,635
you ought to have the courage to
say that's what you're doing.

1236
01:23:14,616 --> 01:23:16,016
You're not talking.
You still there?

1237
01:23:16,075 --> 01:23:17,076
I'm here.

1238
01:23:17,452 --> 01:23:20,622
I gather it was a mongrel.
So many of us are.

1239
01:23:21,122 --> 01:23:24,209
Now the name's a bit of a problem.
I may not have it right.

1240
01:23:24,292 --> 01:23:27,086
It's a Russian word. How's
your Russian, my friend?

1241
01:23:27,545 --> 01:23:28,546
Tell me.

1242
01:23:30,089 --> 01:23:32,967
I may be saying this wrong.
Balalaika.

1243
01:23:33,051 --> 01:23:34,051
Balalaika.

1244
01:23:35,220 --> 01:23:38,306
The name of a musical
instrument, or so she tells me.

1245
01:23:38,890 --> 01:23:42,101
What do you say, pal?
Does it strike a chord?

1246
01:23:46,272 --> 01:23:48,566
You got two hours to
get the money together.

1247
01:23:59,619 --> 01:24:00,620
TJ?

1248
01:24:44,622 --> 01:24:46,708
TJ? What are you doing here?

1249
01:24:46,791 --> 01:24:48,126
Handing you this.

1250
01:24:48,501 --> 01:24:51,296
I told you to give it to Peter.
Not to come down here.

1251
01:24:52,171 --> 01:24:54,215
Matthew, that dude's all spun.

1252
01:24:54,299 --> 01:24:55,939
There's no way I was
gonna give it to him.

1253
01:24:56,467 --> 01:24:57,510
Later.

1254
01:25:01,097 --> 01:25:02,265
How much have we got?

1255
01:25:02,348 --> 01:25:03,433
Hang on a sec.

1256
01:25:03,558 --> 01:25:04,726
Keep it separate.

1257
01:25:06,269 --> 01:25:07,979
Holy fucking shit.

1258
01:25:09,397 --> 01:25:11,983
This is TJ, my associate.

1259
01:25:15,028 --> 01:25:17,614
Paper's good. Ink looks right.

1260
01:25:18,281 --> 01:25:20,283
Nice used bills.
This looks real enough.

1261
01:25:20,617 --> 01:25:22,076
We'll repackage them slightly.

1262
01:25:22,452 --> 01:25:23,572
We'll use the back wrappers,

1263
01:25:23,578 --> 01:25:25,371
but we'll take six bills
out of each stack

1264
01:25:25,455 --> 01:25:26,695
and replace them with real ones.

1265
01:25:26,706 --> 01:25:30,209
Three on top, three on the bottom.
What's this make the count?

1266
01:25:30,501 --> 01:25:32,712
I got at least 210 in fake stuff

1267
01:25:32,795 --> 01:25:34,130
and Kenny brought another six.

1268
01:25:34,339 --> 01:25:35,673
Puts us right about eight.

1269
01:25:36,466 --> 01:25:37,759
That's good enough.

1270
01:25:40,178 --> 01:25:41,971
We have to meet face-to-face.

1271
01:25:42,055 --> 01:25:44,057
You get an opportunity
to inspect the money,

1272
01:25:44,766 --> 01:25:46,726
and we get to see that
the girl is all right.

1273
01:25:46,851 --> 01:25:48,394
And then you people
come down on us.

1274
01:25:48,478 --> 01:25:49,979
You'll have the girl covered.

1275
01:25:50,396 --> 01:25:51,522
A knife at her throat.

1276
01:25:51,606 --> 01:25:52,607
If you want.

1277
01:25:52,690 --> 01:25:55,068
The edge of the blade
tucked up under her windpipe.

1278
01:25:55,151 --> 01:25:56,152
Whatever.

1279
01:25:56,444 --> 01:25:58,655
Yeah, I don't like this
face-to-face business.

1280
01:25:58,821 --> 01:26:00,323
We'll set up 50 yards apart.

1281
01:26:00,865 --> 01:26:03,534
You'll be in place first.
You'll see us arrive.

1282
01:26:03,743 --> 01:26:06,412
You show the girl, then I
come over with the money.

1283
01:26:06,746 --> 01:26:08,790
By yourself? Yes.

1284
01:26:08,998 --> 01:26:09,999
Unarmed?

1285
01:26:10,083 --> 01:26:12,335
I'll have a suitcase
full of money in each hand,

1286
01:26:12,418 --> 01:26:14,337
a gun won't do me much good.

1287
01:26:14,921 --> 01:26:16,255
Keep talking.

1288
01:26:16,798 --> 01:26:20,760
You check the money. When you're
satisfied, you let the girl go.

1289
01:26:20,927 --> 01:26:23,012
Your man takes off
with the cash.

1290
01:26:23,096 --> 01:26:25,139
You and I wait
until you feel good.

1291
01:26:25,932 --> 01:26:26,933
Then we go home.

1292
01:26:27,975 --> 01:26:29,185
You could grab me.

1293
01:26:29,435 --> 01:26:33,523
You'll have that knife you keep talking
about, a gun, too, if you want one.

1294
01:26:34,190 --> 01:26:35,775
You'll see my face.

1295
01:26:35,858 --> 01:26:37,360
Wear a mask.

1296
01:26:37,485 --> 01:26:39,278
Cuts the visibility.

1297
01:26:39,946 --> 01:26:42,699
I already know what
you look like, Ray.

1298
01:26:45,284 --> 01:26:46,327
What do you know?

1299
01:26:47,954 --> 01:26:49,789
I know you're a genetic fuck-up,

1300
01:26:49,872 --> 01:26:51,874
who, if I'd met on
the street 10 years ago,

1301
01:26:51,999 --> 01:26:53,751
I'd have thrown you
out of a fucking window.

1302
01:26:53,835 --> 01:26:55,211
Careful.

1303
01:26:55,294 --> 01:26:57,338
It's been a busy year
for you and your boyfriend.

1304
01:26:57,463 --> 01:26:59,263
You know, I could cut
the little cunt's throat

1305
01:26:59,298 --> 01:27:01,551
and send her back to Daddy
a chunk at a time.

1306
01:27:01,676 --> 01:27:03,636
Then you're dead. Oh?

1307
01:27:04,053 --> 01:27:05,638
Yeah, "oh."

1308
01:27:05,888 --> 01:27:06,889
You want your money

1309
01:27:06,973 --> 01:27:08,307
or you wanna be
looking behind you

1310
01:27:08,391 --> 01:27:10,184
for the rest of your
worthless fucking life?

1311
01:27:11,310 --> 01:27:14,313
Do this deal and I'll sit
on what I know about you.

1312
01:27:14,689 --> 01:27:16,566
You can take your
little Bert and Ernie act

1313
01:27:16,649 --> 01:27:18,109
to the other side
of the country.

1314
01:27:18,192 --> 01:27:19,986
There's plenty of
dope dealers in LA.

1315
01:27:28,244 --> 01:27:29,328
Where do you want to do it?

1316
01:27:30,163 --> 01:27:31,873
How about Green-Wood Cemetery?

1317
01:27:33,166 --> 01:27:34,584
Yeah, I think I know that place.

1318
01:27:34,667 --> 01:27:37,712
You should. That's where
you dumped Leila Andresen.

1319
01:27:38,296 --> 01:27:40,381
There are two entrances
on the Fifth Avenue side.

1320
01:27:41,132 --> 01:27:43,217
Take the 35th Street entrance

1321
01:27:43,301 --> 01:27:45,636
and head south about
20 yards inside the fence.

1322
01:27:45,970 --> 01:27:48,973
We'll enter at 25th
and approach you from there.

1323
01:27:49,557 --> 01:27:51,851
Say, uh, 10:30.

1324
01:27:51,934 --> 01:27:54,187
That gives you over an hour
to get there and set up.

1325
01:27:54,353 --> 01:27:57,190
Leila. Was that her name?

1326
01:27:57,523 --> 01:27:59,025
I would think you'd remember.

1327
01:27:59,150 --> 01:28:01,652
No, once they're in the van,
they're just body parts.

1328
01:28:02,820 --> 01:28:03,988
10:30.

1329
01:28:04,071 --> 01:28:06,199
Oh, God, she was so scared...

1330
01:28:08,576 --> 01:28:10,244
Have you got a rifle?

1331
01:28:10,536 --> 01:28:11,537
Dani.

1332
01:28:11,704 --> 01:28:12,705
Is he a good shot?

1333
01:28:13,122 --> 01:28:16,083
During the day maybe.
Dani's a little nearsighted.

1334
01:28:16,167 --> 01:28:17,710
Peter was in the army.

1335
01:28:21,547 --> 01:28:23,466
Yeah, it was a while ago. Yeah.

1336
01:28:24,675 --> 01:28:28,554
Give him the rifle. Keep Dani and
the other one here with your wife.

1337
01:28:29,263 --> 01:28:30,890
I don't want to
spook our friends.

1338
01:28:55,289 --> 01:28:57,416
Who would like to
read the 12 steps?

1339
01:29:04,674 --> 01:29:06,968
Hi, I'm Sarah
and I'm an alcoholic.

1340
01:29:07,051 --> 01:29:08,386
Hi, Sarah.

1341
01:29:09,846 --> 01:29:11,180
Step one.

1342
01:29:12,056 --> 01:29:14,767
We admitted we were
powerless over alcohol.

1343
01:29:15,434 --> 01:29:17,353
That our lives had
become unmanageable.

1344
01:29:56,767 --> 01:29:57,810
What's the drill?

1345
01:29:57,935 --> 01:29:59,312
Stay in the car. Lock the doors.

1346
01:29:59,395 --> 01:30:01,230
Call 911 if anything goes down.

1347
01:30:01,314 --> 01:30:02,315
This is such bull...

1348
01:30:06,485 --> 01:30:07,486
Step two.

1349
01:30:09,488 --> 01:30:11,365
Came to believe
that a power greater

1350
01:30:11,449 --> 01:30:13,951
than ourselves could
restore us to sanity.

1351
01:30:48,194 --> 01:30:49,612
That's far enough.

1352
01:30:49,695 --> 01:30:52,198
Come out where I can see you.
Show the girl.

1353
01:30:52,323 --> 01:30:54,200
I have a knife to her throat.

1354
01:30:54,992 --> 01:30:56,243
If my hand slips...

1355
01:30:56,327 --> 01:30:57,703
Let's hope it doesn't.

1356
01:30:58,496 --> 01:30:59,705
Is that our money?

1357
01:31:05,544 --> 01:31:06,879
Step three.

1358
01:31:07,213 --> 01:31:09,715
Made a decision to turn
our will and our lives

1359
01:31:09,799 --> 01:31:12,385
over to the care of God
as we understood him.

1360
01:31:16,138 --> 01:31:17,431
Now, let her go.

1361
01:31:17,515 --> 01:31:19,308
We ought to just
shoot this cocksucker.

1362
01:31:19,558 --> 01:31:21,060
Don't change the rules now, Ray.

1363
01:31:27,733 --> 01:31:28,734
Let her go.

1364
01:31:31,237 --> 01:31:32,655
Sweet Lucy.

1365
01:31:34,240 --> 01:31:35,574
I hate to see you go.

1366
01:31:39,745 --> 01:31:43,207
Lucia, walk toward me. Your
father's just over here, Lucia.

1367
01:31:49,588 --> 01:31:50,756
Step four.

1368
01:31:51,549 --> 01:31:52,967
What's the matter with her hand?

1369
01:31:53,050 --> 01:31:54,677
Nothing. She's right as rain.

1370
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:58,097
Made a searching and fearless
moral inventory of ourselves.

1371
01:32:04,770 --> 01:32:06,272
It was before you set the terms.

1372
01:32:09,442 --> 01:32:12,862
Go to your dad. Go to your dad, baby.
Atta girl.

1373
01:32:19,535 --> 01:32:21,287
Go on, get out of here.

1374
01:32:25,374 --> 01:32:27,376
I liked her. She was nice.

1375
01:32:33,299 --> 01:32:35,301
What the fuck is
the matter with you, man?

1376
01:32:35,718 --> 01:32:37,261
Why aren't you afraid?

1377
01:32:37,970 --> 01:32:39,138
I don't know.

1378
01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:42,975
Maybe I don't care if
you shoot me or not.

1379
01:32:43,768 --> 01:32:46,979
Or maybe there's a high-powered
rifle pointed at your head.

1380
01:32:55,071 --> 01:32:56,113
I could still kill you.

1381
01:32:56,197 --> 01:32:57,239
I'm right here.

1382
01:32:58,741 --> 01:33:00,576
In some ways, you'll be
doing me a big favor.

1383
01:33:01,994 --> 01:33:04,663
No. I think I'll just
fade into the shadows.

1384
01:33:06,582 --> 01:33:07,583
They fucked us.

1385
01:33:07,833 --> 01:33:08,834
Shoot him.

1386
01:33:10,753 --> 01:33:11,796
Step five.

1387
01:33:11,921 --> 01:33:14,340
Admitted to God, to ourselves,

1388
01:33:14,673 --> 01:33:18,385
and to another human being the
exact nature of our wrongs.

1389
01:33:31,524 --> 01:33:32,817
Step six.

1390
01:33:33,109 --> 01:33:35,027
We are entirely
ready to have God

1391
01:33:35,111 --> 01:33:37,363
remove all these
defects of character.

1392
01:33:39,532 --> 01:33:40,699
Peter!

1393
01:33:50,292 --> 01:33:51,710
Step seven.

1394
01:33:52,461 --> 01:33:55,339
Humbly ask Him
to remove our shortcomings.

1395
01:34:03,139 --> 01:34:04,390
Step eight.

1396
01:34:04,515 --> 01:34:06,392
Made a list of all
persons we had harmed

1397
01:34:06,851 --> 01:34:09,395
and became willing
to make amends to them all.

1398
01:34:27,746 --> 01:34:28,831
Don't move.

1399
01:34:29,206 --> 01:34:30,875
Kenny, I got to tell you...

1400
01:34:31,417 --> 01:34:32,459
Shh. It's okay.

1401
01:34:32,710 --> 01:34:33,919
You gotta know.

1402
01:34:35,754 --> 01:34:36,839
Ilovedu.

1403
01:34:36,922 --> 01:34:38,090
Step nine.

1404
01:34:39,341 --> 01:34:41,427
Make direct amends
to such people.

1405
01:34:42,595 --> 01:34:43,596
I loved...

1406
01:34:44,930 --> 01:34:46,223
I love you, too, man.

1407
01:34:51,604 --> 01:34:54,899
Except when to do so
would injure them or others.

1408
01:34:59,945 --> 01:35:01,113
Which way did they go?

1409
01:35:07,244 --> 01:35:08,537
He shot me!

1410
01:35:14,376 --> 01:35:15,461
TJ?

1411
01:35:15,628 --> 01:35:16,629
Oh, Christ.

1412
01:35:17,671 --> 01:35:19,591
He must have panicked
when he heard the shooting.

1413
01:35:20,132 --> 01:35:22,551
He can't be out in this rain.
We have to find him.

1414
01:35:23,135 --> 01:35:24,470
Well, he's got a phone, right?

1415
01:35:53,207 --> 01:35:54,208
Help!

1416
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,001
Albert!

1417
01:36:12,351 --> 01:36:13,352
Shit!

1418
01:36:16,855 --> 01:36:17,856
Hello?

1419
01:36:19,358 --> 01:36:20,359
Oh, fuck.

1420
01:36:21,860 --> 01:36:22,861
TJ.

1421
01:36:22,987 --> 01:36:25,114
Scudder. I got in the van.
They don't know I'm here.

1422
01:36:25,197 --> 01:36:27,491
Listen to me.
Get out of there. Now.

1423
01:36:27,700 --> 01:36:29,285
It's cool. I'm in the garage
and they in the house.

1424
01:36:29,368 --> 01:36:30,369
Which is where?

1425
01:36:30,536 --> 01:36:31,704
Sit down.

1426
01:36:33,706 --> 01:36:35,582
I've never been shot before.

1427
01:36:36,583 --> 01:36:38,752
There's a first aid
kit in the bathroom.

1428
01:37:14,413 --> 01:37:15,831
Hey, I don't see any numbers.

1429
01:37:15,914 --> 01:37:17,041
Try next door.

1430
01:37:18,792 --> 01:37:21,128
697.Wait, no.692.

1431
01:37:21,378 --> 01:37:23,088
Okay, now walk away
from the house.

1432
01:37:23,797 --> 01:37:24,882
Go to the corner.

1433
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:28,635
Is any of it real? Some.

1434
01:37:40,522 --> 01:37:41,523
Uh...

1435
01:37:41,607 --> 01:37:43,150
51st Street and Church Avenue.

1436
01:37:43,776 --> 01:37:45,110
Borough Park.

1437
01:37:45,194 --> 01:37:46,474
That's not even
a mile from here.

1438
01:37:47,446 --> 01:37:48,781
Stay put. You hear me?

1439
01:37:49,114 --> 01:37:50,115
Pigs.

1440
01:38:04,088 --> 01:38:05,130
Hey, who's...

1441
01:38:09,676 --> 01:38:11,345
Shit, shit, shit.

1442
01:39:47,733 --> 01:39:49,818
You can have your money back.

1443
01:39:49,902 --> 01:39:51,028
It's downstairs.

1444
01:39:56,200 --> 01:39:57,576
Don't even think about it.

1445
01:40:19,556 --> 01:40:20,599
You're the husband.

1446
01:40:21,391 --> 01:40:22,392
So?

1447
01:40:22,726 --> 01:40:23,726
I was just wondering.

1448
01:40:23,769 --> 01:40:25,489
Were you just going to
leave Ray down there?

1449
01:40:25,604 --> 01:40:26,605
No.

1450
01:40:27,523 --> 01:40:29,858
I was going to get
something to eat.

1451
01:40:29,942 --> 01:40:31,860
I was going to
clean up before I left.

1452
01:40:32,110 --> 01:40:34,154
What were you
going to do with him?

1453
01:40:34,238 --> 01:40:35,405
Chop him up.

1454
01:40:36,156 --> 01:40:38,992
Wrap him. There are plenty
of bags in the cupboard.

1455
01:40:39,076 --> 01:40:41,828
And then what? Deliver him to
somebody in the trunk of a car?

1456
01:40:41,954 --> 01:40:42,955
No.

1457
01:40:44,122 --> 01:40:45,457
That was just for you.

1458
01:40:47,626 --> 01:40:49,461
You have a choice
to make, Kenny.

1459
01:40:50,254 --> 01:40:53,006
There's a lot of hard evidence
against this asshole.

1460
01:40:53,090 --> 01:40:55,300
He's got his dead buddy
in the basement.

1461
01:40:55,801 --> 01:40:57,761
Not to mention
the van in the garage.

1462
01:40:57,844 --> 01:41:01,515
It's gonna be full of fibers and blood
traces and God knows what else.

1463
01:41:02,808 --> 01:41:04,810
He ought to be looking at
three life sentences,

1464
01:41:05,143 --> 01:41:08,647
plus an extra 20 or 30 years
tacked on as a bonus.

1465
01:41:09,314 --> 01:41:11,483
What about the other choice?

1466
01:41:12,025 --> 01:41:13,026
You with me?

1467
01:41:16,989 --> 01:41:17,990
No.

1468
01:41:19,616 --> 01:41:21,535
I could turn him in
and sleep just fine.

1469
01:41:21,660 --> 01:41:23,412
I don't think I could.

1470
01:41:23,495 --> 01:41:25,455
That's why it has
to be your decision.

1471
01:41:28,166 --> 01:41:30,002
Well, I guess I just made it.

1472
01:41:32,671 --> 01:41:34,006
Take it easy, Matt.

1473
01:41:43,015 --> 01:41:44,016
Come on.

1474
01:41:52,399 --> 01:41:54,943
You know I could
help you with that hand.

1475
01:41:57,571 --> 01:41:58,572
Could you?

1476
01:43:08,558 --> 01:43:11,645
Shelter's gonna be closed.
Wait for me back at my place.

1477
01:43:11,937 --> 01:43:13,105
Where are you going?

1478
01:43:13,188 --> 01:43:14,272
Just do as I say.

1479
01:43:25,409 --> 01:43:29,246
Step 10. Continue to
take personal inventory.

1480
01:43:29,371 --> 01:43:32,124
And when we were wrong,
promptly admitted it.

1481
01:43:33,125 --> 01:43:34,126
Step 11.

1482
01:43:34,793 --> 01:43:36,795
Sought through
prayer and meditation

1483
01:43:37,337 --> 01:43:41,007
to improve our conscious contact
with God as we understand him.

1484
01:43:41,174 --> 01:43:43,301
Praying only for
the knowledge of his will

1485
01:43:43,385 --> 01:43:45,971
for us and the power
to carry that out.

1486
01:43:47,639 --> 01:43:52,519
Step 12. Having had a spiritual
awakening as the result of these steps,

1487
01:43:53,145 --> 01:43:55,897
we try to carry this
message to alcoholics

1488
01:43:56,148 --> 01:43:59,651
and to practice these
principles in all our affairs.

1489
01:44:32,976 --> 01:44:34,144
Kenny?

1490
01:47:39,996 --> 01:47:40,997
You know,

1491
01:47:43,083 --> 01:47:44,376
I just wanted to...
