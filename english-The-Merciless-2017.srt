1
00:00:59,802 --> 00:01:02,759
Are you enjoying yourself, tell me.
Do you like that fish?

2
00:01:03,706 --> 00:01:05,511
I can't get enough.

3
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:07,791
I love it raw,

4
00:01:07,815 --> 00:01:10,769
fried, in all its forms, in fact.

5
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:13,833
I don't eat it.

6
00:01:13,857 --> 00:01:14,878
Why?

7
00:01:15,369 --> 00:01:17,877
The trick with the fish,

8
00:01:17,901 --> 00:01:20,100
is that they die with eyes wide open.

9
00:01:20,124 --> 00:01:23,806
I feel they fixate me
and talk bullshit.

10
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:25,506
I can't stand them.

11
00:01:26,339 --> 00:01:30,333
What about anchovies?
I know you eat it.

12
00:01:30,839 --> 00:01:32,607
Anchovies are OK.

13
00:01:32,632 --> 00:01:35,171
It is also fish,
with eyes.

14
00:01:35,735 --> 00:01:38,529
They have tiny eyes.

15
00:01:39,912 --> 00:01:42,996
Me, I can't look in the eyes.

16
00:01:43,151 --> 00:01:45,401
Jae-ho, he's the opposite.

17
00:01:45,426 --> 00:01:47,918
He kills while looking
right in the eyes.

18
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:51,149
Besides, he loves fish.
He eats that.

19
00:01:53,022 --> 00:01:56,333
You're like a kid
When you talk about Jae-ho.

20
00:01:56,546 --> 00:01:58,446
You're all excited.

21
00:02:01,685 --> 00:02:03,708
I think he doesn't feel any remorse.

22
00:02:04,422 --> 00:02:07,259
But the guilt,
It's sometimes useful.

23
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:11,803
Thanks to this,
Our business has evolved.

24
00:02:12,552 --> 00:02:16,431
In the Stone Age,
They were killing with pebbles.

25
00:02:17,787 --> 00:02:21,387
In the Bronze Age and Iron Age,
With knives and axes.

26
00:02:22,356 --> 00:02:24,942
Now, it's with guns.

27
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:27,843
Guns reduce guilt.

28
00:02:27,999 --> 00:02:30,200
Probably because they kill at a distance.

29
00:02:30,429 --> 00:02:32,763
Fuck, What's this bullshit?

30
00:02:41,063 --> 00:02:43,104
I can't look at him.

31
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,807
Nice work, Nicolai.

32
00:02:56,522 --> 00:03:01,549
MERCILESS

33

<font color="#f6f900">1st day after release from prison</font>

34
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:43,144
That's really corny.

35
00:03:44,301 --> 00:03:46,293
The hurdle of honor,

36
00:03:47,248 --> 00:03:49,716
The color of the car.

37
00:03:58,586 --> 00:04:01,411
And the worst, the tradition of tofu.

38
00:04:05,025 --> 00:04:06,306
It's mine.

39
00:04:14,853 --> 00:04:16,304
What about me?

40
00:04:17,395 --> 00:04:18,395
You?

41
00:04:22,635 --> 00:04:24,281
Natasha!

42
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:05,157
The only woman I respect,

43
00:05:05,182 --> 00:05:07,778
It's you, Inspector Cheon.

44
00:05:08,106 --> 00:05:10,183
I love your tenacity.

45
00:05:11,637 --> 00:05:14,912
My lawyers want to ask you

46
00:05:14,936 --> 00:05:18,714
of the damages and interests

47
00:05:20,206 --> 00:05:22,404
But I quickly calmed them down.

48
00:05:22,594 --> 00:05:26,493
"First of all you need respect,
To be respected. "

49
00:05:28,813 --> 00:05:33,316
So many CEOs for such a small country.

50
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:37,118
Personally,
I have nothing against you.

51
00:05:38,269 --> 00:05:41,786
My job,
is to put the smugglers behind bars.

52
00:05:42,755 --> 00:05:45,201
It's just like that,
which gives me an advancement.

53
00:05:46,766 --> 00:05:48,647
Give me a hand.

54
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:52,755
A helping hand, my ass.
Do you have any evidence?

55
00:05:55,431 --> 00:05:57,986
It's Russian beluga.

56
00:05:58,673 --> 00:06:01,495
It costs a month of your salary.

57
00:06:02,345 --> 00:06:03,884
Want to taste?

58
00:06:07,594 --> 00:06:09,792
Do you do it with your fingers?

59
00:06:14,937 --> 00:06:17,014
You don't get it up for a long time?

60
00:06:18,184 --> 00:06:19,987
Shit, I can not believe it.

61
00:06:20,011 --> 00:06:22,159
Say thank you and chow.

62
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,668
That makes a lease, inspector!

63
00:06:30,236 --> 00:06:32,207
Still beautiful !

64
00:06:36,388 --> 00:06:37,634
A beginner ?

65
00:06:38,456 --> 00:06:39,606
Who are you ?

66
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:44,485
We know each other ?
Why do you talk to me?

67
00:06:45,061 --> 00:06:47,425
I can't believe it.

68
00:06:51,996 --> 00:06:53,178
Very good !

69
00:06:54,383 --> 00:06:56,697
Make a good chow-down

70
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,428
And have fun with girls.

71
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:04,202
You will end up in jail
and jerk off in front of the wall.

72
00:07:05,613 --> 00:07:07,406
Isn't that right, Mr. Han?

73
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:16,877
<font color="#f6f900">Three years ago
Gyeonggi Penitentiary</font>

74
00:07:19,028 --> 00:07:20,527
1, 2, 3!

75
00:07:35,098 --> 00:07:36,827
Next ! No one ?

76
00:07:36,851 --> 00:07:38,851
Come on, you do not deflate!

77
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,818
There, a candidate!

78
00:07:54,276 --> 00:07:57,708
I hesitate. A breath would knock him out.

79
00:08:00,926 --> 00:08:02,187
Ready!

80
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,287
1, 2, 3!

81
00:08:07,605 --> 00:08:08,696
Kid,

82
00:08:08,681 --> 00:08:11,623
Put your teeth together,
not to cut your tongue.

83
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,602
Son of a bitch!

84
00:09:16,624 --> 00:09:18,637
It was a punch!

85
00:09:18,918 --> 00:09:20,630
You want to give me a punch!

86
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:22,113
Calm down.

87
00:09:22,585 --> 00:09:23,802
It's a shame.

88
00:09:23,826 --> 00:09:26,355
It was a punch,
Dirty cheater.

89
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:29,487
It was a slap,
bald ass-fucker.

90
00:09:29,931 --> 00:09:31,476
Bitch!

91
00:09:34,763 --> 00:09:36,070
Ass-fucker!

92
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:43,641
Catch him!

93
00:09:52,227 --> 00:09:53,520
Sorry !

94
00:10:11,643 --> 00:10:12,952
Motherfucker !

95
00:10:24,131 --> 00:10:25,384
Son of a bitch!

96
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,481
I slapped like that!

97
00:10:29,341 --> 00:10:30,776
Like that!

98
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,474
That's a punch!

99
00:10:42,088 --> 00:10:44,446
He's a big tart, this guy!

100
00:11:06,126 --> 00:11:07,697
Why are you here?

101
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:10,353
There are two kinds of guys

102
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:13,149
Which are locked up here.

103
00:11:15,496 --> 00:11:17,812
Those with whom you can mess

104
00:11:18,305 --> 00:11:20,550
And the real bastards.

105
00:11:20,557 --> 00:11:25,661
The ones you fucked
Are among the latter.

106
00:11:27,058 --> 00:11:28,399
And you ?

107
00:11:37,858 --> 00:11:39,263
In your opinion ?

108
00:11:40,744 --> 00:11:43,417
I believe that you belong to
the real bastards.

109
00:11:48,538 --> 00:11:49,538
No.

110
00:11:50,823 --> 00:11:53,291
I am the referee.

111
00:11:54,394 --> 00:11:57,286
I advise you to keep a low profile.

112
00:12:06,555 --> 00:12:07,610
Say...

113
00:12:10,103 --> 00:12:12,146
you have beautiful eyes you know.

114
00:12:35,793 --> 00:12:36,793
Pan!

115
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:06,422
You've been given a pardon.

116
00:13:07,944 --> 00:13:10,495
These are not the kind of guys
to let it pass.

117
00:13:11,527 --> 00:13:13,784
Looks like they've decided
To close their eyes.

118
00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:23,665
Between the blessed children of God,
lets be friends.

119
00:13:23,689 --> 00:13:25,133
I'm not a believer.

120
00:13:25,157 --> 00:13:28,433
If I am with you,
These demons will give me peace.

121
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:32,205
After the dueling of slaps,
You made a name for yourself.

122
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:48,344
He manages the tax on cigarettes.

123
00:13:49,141 --> 00:13:50,307
The cigarettes?

124
00:13:50,902 --> 00:13:54,440
Do not hawk all, off the bat
like the last time.

125
00:13:54,795 --> 00:13:57,569
You will receive the cash
For three boxes tomorrow.

126
00:14:00,025 --> 00:14:03,167
To control the traffic of cigarettes,
It pays big here.

127
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:08,665
It's the war
To have the monopoly.

128
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,455
That's Han Jae-ho.

129
00:14:16,785 --> 00:14:17,983
Hallelujah!

130
00:14:19,486 --> 00:14:22,430
Han's been dealing with meth
Since he is a teenager.

131
00:14:22,601 --> 00:14:24,839
He's not a real leader,

132
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:27,801
But even the bosses

133
00:14:28,226 --> 00:14:30,805
Move away from him
Like the Red Sea.

134
00:14:32,217 --> 00:14:34,875
Everyone knows
That he has a handheld.

135
00:14:35,238 --> 00:14:37,047
That's Jesus Christ in prison.

136
00:14:37,385 --> 00:14:41,169
He dines every night in the kitchen
With his disciples.

137
00:14:41,185 --> 00:14:42,828
Fill your glasses!

138
00:14:44,047 --> 00:14:46,546
Let's have a toast.

139
00:14:52,422 --> 00:14:53,422
We are...

140
00:14:53,446 --> 00:14:55,446
a family !

141
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:58,279
Boss ! We love you !

142
00:15:14,403 --> 00:15:16,681
<font color="#f6f900">13th day after release from prison</font>

143
00:15:20,555 --> 00:15:23,666
Han told me
The greatest good of you...

144
00:15:24,051 --> 00:15:26,180
A good brain
And a nice punch.

145
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:30,023
The brains, I don't know,
But the punch ...

146
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:33,187
Want to check?

147
00:15:36,507 --> 00:15:37,887
What do you mean ?

148
00:15:37,893 --> 00:15:40,359
He wants to rub himself on you.

149
00:15:42,171 --> 00:15:44,337
I do not want dishonored cum.

150
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:45,903
Stop.

151
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,010
Jae-ho.

152
00:15:49,165 --> 00:15:51,244
It's me you should remember!

153
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,034
No it's me.

154
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:04,352
Cocky little upstart.

155
00:16:04,836 --> 00:16:05,836
If you win,

156
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:09,565
I will sing the national anthem
By sucking your cock.

157
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:13,062
You're not my type.

158
00:16:14,752 --> 00:16:16,101
Fucker!

159
00:16:18,348 --> 00:16:20,030
It's a real gun?

160
00:16:37,641 --> 00:16:39,023
Shit!

161
00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:48,134
Come here.

162
00:16:53,752 --> 00:16:55,124
My dear nephew,

163
00:16:55,828 --> 00:16:57,082
you should

164
00:16:57,647 --> 00:17:00,970
Separate work and pleasure.

165
00:17:02,471 --> 00:17:05,445
Don't be an idiot like your father.

166
00:17:07,383 --> 00:17:08,383
Go.

167
00:17:18,486 --> 00:17:19,525
Bitch...

168
00:17:22,529 --> 00:17:23,703
Shit !

169
00:17:28,533 --> 00:17:29,588
Are you okay ?

170
00:17:32,701 --> 00:17:35,412
Why did you leave so early?

171
00:17:38,554 --> 00:17:39,983
You cried ?

172
00:17:42,578 --> 00:17:43,994
I've cried?

173
00:17:44,018 --> 00:17:45,153
Sorry ?

174
00:17:45,194 --> 00:17:47,023
I've cried, asshole?

175
00:17:47,352 --> 00:17:48,566
Yes sir.

176
00:17:48,597 --> 00:17:51,962
Jerk! Tell me when I cried?

177
00:17:52,303 --> 00:17:53,906
Get down!

178
00:17:58,317 --> 00:18:00,836
It was like Jae-ho, in jail?

179
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,507
Without me,
He ought to behave like a king.

180
00:18:05,674 --> 00:18:07,502
Rather like a president.

181
00:18:07,865 --> 00:18:09,599
What is the difference ?

182
00:18:10,301 --> 00:18:12,040
A president has a mandate.

183
00:18:13,414 --> 00:18:15,347
When it's over,
It can be replaced.

184
00:18:37,012 --> 00:18:38,012
Good Lord!

185
00:18:38,407 --> 00:18:40,013
the time has come.

186
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:42,708
What?

187
00:18:43,749 --> 00:18:44,880
Kim Sung-han.

188
00:18:45,437 --> 00:18:47,593
You surely
Heard of him.

189
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:49,409
That's a big fish.

190
00:18:55,191 --> 00:18:56,655
We'll see.

191
00:18:57,694 --> 00:18:59,926
This is the election campaign.

192
00:19:34,253 --> 00:19:36,974
I know of your reputation.
It is an honor.

193
00:19:37,011 --> 00:19:38,493
I'm Han Jae-ho.

194
00:19:40,786 --> 00:19:42,726
You're the boss here, it seems.

195
00:19:43,344 --> 00:19:45,185
I don't about the bush.

196
00:19:45,388 --> 00:19:49,188
I will be brief. Let's share
The business of the cigarettes, 50-50.

197
00:19:49,449 --> 00:19:52,162
No change
Neither the price nor the quality ...

198
00:19:52,186 --> 00:19:53,208
Listening.

199
00:19:56,051 --> 00:19:57,409
I'm Kim Sung-han.

200
00:19:58,843 --> 00:20:00,976
I am a small clerk
in your eyes ?

201
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,507
It seems you were making a living
By dealing meth.

202
00:20:14,705 --> 00:20:17,186
If war is declared,
who will win ?

203
00:20:17,698 --> 00:20:20,963
If not, do we start right away?

204
00:20:25,941 --> 00:20:28,472
Boss, the guards took Ho-yeol.

205
00:20:48,377 --> 00:20:51,322
Well, can we talk?

206
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,388
Chief Warden!

207
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,775
There will be a general inspection.

208
00:21:01,796 --> 00:21:03,220
Is this a joke?

209
00:21:08,605 --> 00:21:09,299
What?

210
00:21:09,323 --> 00:21:11,005
Is that Kim Sung-han?

211
00:21:11,573 --> 00:21:14,466
He poured more water on you, that's it!
He gives you more than me?

212
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:18,107
Son of a bitch!
Repeat what you just said!

213
00:21:21,842 --> 00:21:23,577
You bloody stinker!

214
00:21:26,944 --> 00:21:28,139
Bitch.

215
00:21:30,124 --> 00:21:31,762
What riffraff ...

216
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:38,931
Stop. That's enough !

217
00:21:39,111 --> 00:21:41,411
Stop. You're gonna kill him.

218
00:21:42,027 --> 00:21:43,189
Take him.

219
00:21:47,436 --> 00:21:49,526
- Send him to the hole.
- Yes sir.

220
00:22:14,676 --> 00:22:16,392
The elections are over.

221
00:22:16,989 --> 00:22:20,055
Kim and the Chief Warden
Come from the same corner.

222
00:22:26,776 --> 00:22:29,093
631, outside.

223
00:22:31,129 --> 00:22:33,126
Han Jae-ho is coming, chief.

224
00:22:34,236 --> 00:22:36,618
The director disperse the crowd

225
00:22:37,107 --> 00:22:39,031
So he's isolated for the moment.

226
00:22:39,909 --> 00:22:43,983
He is a hard one
But he will not survive on his own.

227
00:22:48,186 --> 00:22:50,176
- Let's drink.
- Everybody !

228
00:24:15,226 --> 00:24:16,513
Guardian!

229
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,239
He has a knife!
Guardian!

230
00:24:26,803 --> 00:24:28,008
It's yours !

231
00:24:28,178 --> 00:24:29,745
Not at all !

232
00:24:29,929 --> 00:24:32,835
He took it out of his sleeve.
I saw him.

233
00:24:38,552 --> 00:24:40,190
Can you prove it?

234
00:24:40,418 --> 00:24:41,493
How?

235
00:24:41,986 --> 00:24:43,855
I didn't take a picture!

236
00:25:05,018 --> 00:25:07,164
Just a cartridge,
For your life?

237
00:25:09,739 --> 00:25:11,782
The investigation begins tomorrow.

238
00:25:12,529 --> 00:25:13,747
It is useless.

239
00:25:14,945 --> 00:25:18,630
Kim and the Chief Warden
Must already masturbate together.

240
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:22,630
There's something I do not get.

241
00:25:24,007 --> 00:25:28,482
The war is completely lost
for me.

242
00:25:28,831 --> 00:25:30,431
Why would they want to kill me?

243
00:25:36,845 --> 00:25:38,238
Why did they do that ?

244
00:25:40,494 --> 00:25:42,703
My mother always told me

245
00:25:42,727 --> 00:25:44,841
The once who fail to help are
Those who suffer.

246
00:25:49,808 --> 00:25:51,428
Come on, we'll see you tomorrow.

247
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,620
Yes.

248
00:26:13,103 --> 00:26:15,180
You always have your handheld?

249
00:26:17,543 --> 00:26:19,478
Do you have something to report?

250
00:26:21,899 --> 00:26:25,632
I found it on the floor.
You should take a look at it.

251
00:26:25,953 --> 00:26:29,618
It has photos on it,
Rather interesting.

252
00:26:41,047 --> 00:26:45,872
I would like to request this
guy for cigarette smuggle.

253
00:26:48,883 --> 00:26:49,883
This guy?

254
00:26:50,416 --> 00:26:51,927
"Sir", please.

255
00:26:52,697 --> 00:26:53,835
This "Sir".

256
00:26:54,381 --> 00:26:56,131
Are you threatening me?

257
00:26:56,180 --> 00:27:01,851
How can we dare to threaten
The chief guard?

258
00:27:03,149 --> 00:27:06,297
With the photos,
Your report will be easy to establish.

259
00:27:06,908 --> 00:27:08,134
Fuck!

260
00:27:08,281 --> 00:27:10,803
Motherfuckers!

261
00:27:11,101 --> 00:27:14,070
Son of a bitch, I fuck you.

262
00:27:15,882 --> 00:27:18,856
Motherfucker, you shitting me?

263
00:27:18,872 --> 00:27:19,995
Not at all.

264
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:22,897
I also see
The illegal possession of a telephone.

265
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:24,898
Son of a bitch!

266
00:27:26,321 --> 00:27:28,118
You shit!

267
00:27:30,556 --> 00:27:32,035
Didn't you catch it?

268
00:27:32,829 --> 00:27:35,719
We have already sent these photos

269
00:27:35,743 --> 00:27:38,124
To the gentleman's friends.

270
00:27:38,483 --> 00:27:41,736
If they can not contact us
Or visit us,

271
00:27:42,643 --> 00:27:45,285
Photos will be transmitted
To the prosecutor.

272
00:27:48,772 --> 00:27:50,260
Warden.

273
00:27:50,814 --> 00:27:54,559
I risk another year,
that's all.

274
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:58,620
In your opinion,
Whom will I denounce first?

275
00:28:17,652 --> 00:28:19,107
When I was a kid,

276
00:28:20,158 --> 00:28:24,011
I have devoured your memories:

277
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:29,077
"Every night my fists are crying."

278
00:28:31,832 --> 00:28:36,621
You say you demolished
Thirty guys at once.

279
00:28:36,842 --> 00:28:37,909
That is true ?

280
00:28:39,065 --> 00:28:43,006
I thought you had
Super-powers.

281
00:28:50,389 --> 00:28:52,308
Boss, it's ready.

282
00:28:54,111 --> 00:28:55,146
Just a second.

283
00:29:06,634 --> 00:29:07,926
Ouch, it's hot!

284
00:29:29,528 --> 00:29:30,984
You can go out.

285
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,909
Fuck!

286
00:29:54,898 --> 00:29:57,524
You're a real gangster,
it shows.

287
00:30:00,125 --> 00:30:02,311
There's something eles intriguing me.

288
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,276
There is no chance
That we meet outside.

289
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:08,001
So why did you want to kill me?

290
00:30:10,054 --> 00:30:12,468
I have difficulties to connect the dots.

291
00:30:17,269 --> 00:30:18,820
I apologize.

292
00:30:19,347 --> 00:30:20,867
Stop it now.

293
00:30:24,414 --> 00:30:26,267
Wrong answer !

294
00:30:30,625 --> 00:30:31,952
Ko Byung-chul!

295
00:30:32,001 --> 00:30:33,902
This is Mr. Ko!

296
00:30:34,089 --> 00:30:35,809
Shut your mouth !

297
00:30:36,133 --> 00:30:40,421
It was your boss who gave it to you!

298
00:30:40,445 --> 00:30:43,122
Do you realize
what you say?

299
00:30:43,146 --> 00:30:45,146
And the delivery of the 5 Kg?

300
00:30:45,387 --> 00:30:48,240
Your boss promised 30% to our gang

301
00:30:48,264 --> 00:30:50,079
If we killed you!

302
00:30:50,994 --> 00:30:52,369
Son of a bitch!

303
00:30:52,393 --> 00:30:54,942
That's enough !

304
00:31:04,805 --> 00:31:06,031
This time...

305
00:31:08,042 --> 00:31:10,535
That's a good answer.

306
00:31:13,072 --> 00:31:14,281
Isn't it ?

307
00:31:16,433 --> 00:31:18,016
I'm Kim Sung-han.

308
00:31:19,364 --> 00:31:21,548
What happened today ...

309
00:31:22,284 --> 00:31:26,677
Tomorrow does not exist for us.
It's useless to threaten me.

310
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:34,481
There are so many accidents here ...

311
00:31:35,376 --> 00:31:36,982
Here.

312
00:31:38,685 --> 00:31:40,919
Look at me.

313
00:31:41,214 --> 00:31:44,465
Come on, look at me.

314
00:31:44,613 --> 00:31:46,238
If you do not look at me,

315
00:31:46,274 --> 00:31:48,015
It will never end.

316
00:31:59,522 --> 00:32:00,741
Very good.

317
00:32:18,427 --> 00:32:19,613
Ball.

318
00:32:19,703 --> 00:32:23,634
<font color="#f6f900">32nd day after release from prison</font>

319
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,535
Strike!

320
00:32:32,953 --> 00:32:34,024
Out!

321
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:37,546
You are sure that Kim Sung-han

322
00:32:37,703 --> 00:32:39,874
Had a heart attack?

323
00:32:41,948 --> 00:32:45,475
And Jae-ho, he has no suspicions?

324
00:32:46,253 --> 00:32:47,676
You start again.

325
00:32:48,074 --> 00:32:50,192
My uncle, I've already checked.

326
00:32:50,629 --> 00:32:52,597
Kim had some tension.

327
00:32:53,567 --> 00:32:55,329
The older you get,

328
00:32:56,302 --> 00:32:58,714
The more one becomes paranoid.

329
00:32:59,009 --> 00:33:00,937
And more sensitive too ...

330
00:33:04,348 --> 00:33:05,633
Thank you.

331
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:13,754
My uncle.

332
00:33:15,342 --> 00:33:18,005
Jae-ho, what are you going to do with him?

333
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,724
He is still useful to us.

334
00:33:21,221 --> 00:33:24,208
The friendship of two orphans,
it's for life.

335
00:33:24,387 --> 00:33:25,728
Not necessarily.

336
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:28,416
You and I are the same blood.

337
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:30,900
It's a family affair.

338
00:33:32,583 --> 00:33:33,583
Good.

339
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:36,107
I have a question to ask you.

340
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:42,691
You pick up a stray dog
in the street

341
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,950
And you feed him well.

342
00:33:46,197 --> 00:33:48,910
It becomes fat
And its hair is shiny.

343
00:33:50,401 --> 00:33:56,651
But as we grew older,
He no longer stirs his tail.

344
00:33:58,154 --> 00:34:00,816
He barks
And sometimes shows his fangs.

345
00:34:02,316 --> 00:34:06,725
The funny thing is, it takes time
For a human being.

346
00:34:07,685 --> 00:34:08,922
This dog...

347
00:34:10,203 --> 00:34:11,440
Byung-gab.

348
00:34:12,332 --> 00:34:14,260
What must his master do?

349
00:34:15,226 --> 00:34:16,893
If you were in my place ...

350
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:24,093
You are idiots or what?

351
00:34:26,051 --> 00:34:27,388
You stupid!

352
00:34:27,412 --> 00:34:29,967
You almost injured Mr. Ko!

353
00:34:30,264 --> 00:34:32,858
It has been a long time,
I have more control of my strength.

354
00:34:33,048 --> 00:34:34,730
Sorry, boss!

355
00:34:37,778 --> 00:34:39,293
Be soft !

356
00:34:40,228 --> 00:34:41,537
What assholes.

357
00:34:42,265 --> 00:34:45,056
If I do nothing,
He will eventually bite me.

358
00:34:45,495 --> 00:34:47,447
You have to prick it then.

359
00:34:48,508 --> 00:34:49,556
Indeed.

360
00:34:50,012 --> 00:34:54,332
We finish the deal with the Russians
And they take care of him.

361
00:35:02,089 --> 00:35:03,724
<i>Ocean Import</i>

362
00:35:04,115 --> 00:35:06,574
<i>The home of fresh fish</i>

General direction. Busan Police</font>

368
00:35:25,022 --> 00:35:26,566
Why are we looking at this?

369
00:35:26,628 --> 00:35:29,352
This is our main target.

370
00:35:29,868 --> 00:35:32,316
Ko Byung-chul, 52 years old.

371
00:35:32,657 --> 00:35:36,524
CEO of Ocean import
And head of the fishermen's union.

372
00:35:36,995 --> 00:35:37,995
Mr. Ko, the CEO?

373
00:35:38,059 --> 00:35:41,288
He delivered strippers to
A Russian nightclub.

374
00:35:41,538 --> 00:35:44,332
That's how he knew
Gegard of Vladivostok.

375
00:35:44,839 --> 00:35:48,677
Vitaly Gegard controls more than 80 cargo ships

376
00:35:48,701 --> 00:35:51,164
Which dock at the port of Busan.

377
00:36:00,888 --> 00:36:02,130
Continue.

378
00:36:05,341 --> 00:36:10,189
In 2008, Ko moved to Busan
And founded the company Ocean import.

379
00:36:11,347 --> 00:36:15,147
It's a cover
For smuggling operations.

380
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:23,782
Meth hashish cocaine
Transit through coolers.

381
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,626
More than 15 kg have been imported
last year.

382
00:36:27,369 --> 00:36:29,191
You should have stopped him!

383
00:36:29,289 --> 00:36:32,809
No use crying over
spilled milk.

384
00:36:34,342 --> 00:36:35,640
File this case.

385
00:36:36,854 --> 00:36:38,921
Find a deal
Which is of interest to the press.

386
00:36:39,103 --> 00:36:41,495
A celebrity who is drugged,
for example.

387
00:36:43,704 --> 00:36:48,947
Why not legalize the cam
for that matter ?

388
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:53,292
It seems we are on a very high level!

389
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:56,131
Let's make the people happy
for once.

390
00:36:56,156 --> 00:36:57,585
- Shut up !
- What?

391
00:36:59,291 --> 00:37:00,291
Chief ?

392
00:37:00,693 --> 00:37:01,990
Explain me !

393
00:37:02,006 --> 00:37:03,939
It is an economic problem.

394
00:37:04,396 --> 00:37:08,530
The Russian import quota
Decreases each year.

395
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,547
If the Mafia ships are also banned,
It will be a disaster.

396
00:37:15,283 --> 00:37:17,955
So we drop the drug
Because of the fish?

397
00:37:17,988 --> 00:37:22,013
Calm down
And do as I ask.

398
00:37:22,045 --> 00:37:24,577
It's not by sitting idle

399
00:37:24,661 --> 00:37:26,927
That you will be awarded a medal!

400
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:30,386
Han Jae-ho out of jail
In 2 or 3 years.

401
00:37:30,545 --> 00:37:32,954
We can kill two birds with one stone.

402
00:37:33,452 --> 00:37:35,011
What is your plan?

403
00:37:38,075 --> 00:37:39,856
Infiltrate our men.

404
00:38:12,529 --> 00:38:13,699
That's okay ?

405
00:38:20,934 --> 00:38:22,468
It's a three-year mission.

406
00:38:23,187 --> 00:38:24,187
It's long.

407
00:38:24,214 --> 00:38:26,041
- With whom ?
- No one.

408
00:38:26,081 --> 00:38:28,641
The police, the customs ...
No one knows.

409
00:38:28,644 --> 00:38:31,337
We infiltrate North Korea?

410
00:38:31,354 --> 00:38:33,429
A rookie and a thief.

411
00:38:37,107 --> 00:38:38,573
The rookie is me!

412
00:38:38,576 --> 00:38:40,508
Lower your arm, you idiot.

413
00:38:40,696 --> 00:38:44,495
You are still single.
I have a wife and a son.

414
00:38:45,285 --> 00:38:46,285
Inspector.

415
00:38:46,292 --> 00:38:48,620
My son just spoke his first word.

416
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,790
You know what he said?
Guess !

417
00:38:50,889 --> 00:38:54,362
We're selling the family now?
My mother is very sick.

418
00:38:54,426 --> 00:38:55,809
You know, don't you?

419
00:38:55,845 --> 00:38:58,023
His first word was "daddy".

420
00:38:58,117 --> 00:39:01,202
In his mother's womb, he already
listened to songs in English.

421
00:39:01,445 --> 00:39:04,919
It's not the time
To send his father to jail!

422
00:39:05,145 --> 00:39:06,252
Jo Hyun-su,

423
00:39:06,778 --> 00:39:08,432
I count on you.

424
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:14,653
For such a mission,

425
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:18,139
Why take a rookie like me?

426
00:39:18,425 --> 00:39:20,817
Modesty does not suit you at all.

427
00:39:21,757 --> 00:39:24,356
You were the first of your class.

428
00:39:26,449 --> 00:39:28,675
I can't.
I do not want to.

429
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,552
I would have warned you!

430
00:39:34,569 --> 00:39:37,933
Take him.
He always has hidden missions.

431
00:39:37,966 --> 00:39:40,226
I did a lot of shit!

432
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:42,160
It's me who always has to do the shit!

433
00:39:42,184 --> 00:39:44,394
You really make me do shit, there!

434
00:39:44,528 --> 00:39:48,553
Inspector, the jail for him
And the gang for me, okay?

435
00:39:59,754 --> 00:40:01,806
I'll find a kidney for your mother.

436
00:40:07,788 --> 00:40:10,984
Dialysis costs will be covered
Before the operation.

437
00:40:12,514 --> 00:40:13,938
It's up to you to decide.

438
00:40:26,974 --> 00:40:30,737
The freighter came from Hong Kong
And went to Incheon.

439
00:40:31,361 --> 00:40:33,656
It carried 20,000 bamboos
And Chinese Ephedra ...

440
00:40:34,455 --> 00:40:36,276
Of ephedrine.

441
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:39,490
But the docking time has leaked.

442
00:40:39,691 --> 00:40:41,201
Do you have a presentation?

443
00:40:41,722 --> 00:40:43,388
You tell your exploits.

444
00:40:43,411 --> 00:40:45,311
I am better in the situation.

445
00:40:47,247 --> 00:40:49,302
Isn't it good, that?

446
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,480
Guy.

447
00:40:56,901 --> 00:40:58,166
We're working here!

448
00:40:58,259 --> 00:41:01,581
Your language will be more precious
Than your fists.

449
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:03,802
Be more convincing.

450
00:41:08,974 --> 00:41:11,842
We disembarked at Incheon
At 2 o'clock in the morning.

451
00:41:11,911 --> 00:41:13,534
But there was a leak.

452
00:41:13,851 --> 00:41:16,173
The port swarmed with cops.

453
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,900
What should we do?

454
00:41:21,266 --> 00:41:24,666
Unload the bamboo, hide for
One week in the bunkers.

455
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:26,348
We're fucked
like dead rats.

456
00:41:26,388 --> 00:41:31,679
False Chinese viagra was found.

457
00:41:31,719 --> 00:41:34,040
The Sino-Koreans said to themselves:

458
00:41:34,627 --> 00:41:36,707
"We'll see if it works."

459
00:41:38,508 --> 00:41:40,976
Result, they all got a hard on
Like deer.

460
00:41:41,052 --> 00:41:42,979
It was effective, then!

461
00:41:43,055 --> 00:41:44,814
Yes quite.

462
00:41:44,957 --> 00:41:48,159
They eventually got off the boat
And got caught.

463
00:41:50,665 --> 00:41:53,976
The trucks were called,
All discharged in one second

464
00:41:53,992 --> 00:41:55,464
And spun.

465
00:41:56,929 --> 00:41:58,315
And the Sino-Koreans?

466
00:41:58,347 --> 00:41:59,922
Everything was unloaded.

467
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:03,337
Without evidence,
The cops released them.

468
00:42:03,556 --> 00:42:04,758
Hallelujah!

469
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:06,929
Viagra has saved everyone.

470
00:42:07,361 --> 00:42:09,828
Viagra saves all that is dead.

471
00:42:16,516 --> 00:42:17,877
No, not that !

472
00:42:28,027 --> 00:42:30,437
Make a wish.

473
00:42:32,597 --> 00:42:33,597
Me...

474
00:42:34,715 --> 00:42:36,440
I want a new cell.

475
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:38,199
The biggest !

476
00:42:39,138 --> 00:42:40,749
It's mine.

477
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,889
<i> Han is not easy to fool ... </ i></i>

478
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:48,057
So ? He died on the hook?

479
00:42:48,644 --> 00:42:50,679
Yeah, a little ...

480
00:42:52,503 --> 00:42:55,373
We'll see. No more news?

481
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:58,331
<i>Congratulations. We have a kidney.</i>

482
00:42:58,581 --> 00:43:00,727
<i>Your mother will soon be operated.</i>

483
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:02,480
That is true ?

484
00:43:04,157 --> 00:43:05,157
Yes !

485
00:43:07,748 --> 00:43:09,214
Good news ?

486
00:43:09,418 --> 00:43:12,025
Yes mom. I'll call you soon.

487
00:43:24,632 --> 00:43:25,789
Tell me.

488
00:43:27,632 --> 00:43:30,546
At your age, you're still
In your mother's skirts?

489
00:43:30,767 --> 00:43:32,311
You exaggerate.

490
00:43:32,609 --> 00:43:34,621
Family love, don't you know?

491
00:43:34,721 --> 00:43:38,523
I don't have a family.
I can't know.

492
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:42,136
But your gang's out,
It's your family.

493
00:43:44,924 --> 00:43:47,801
And if I joined your gang
At my release?

494
00:43:48,328 --> 00:43:49,514
What do you think ?

495
00:43:50,834 --> 00:43:54,433
It was just a joke.
Don't worry yourself!

496
00:43:58,175 --> 00:44:01,431
Kim Sung-han is here, right?
Nothing to report?

497
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:06,984
He had a heart attack
upon arrival.

498
00:44:07,552 --> 00:44:08,857
A heart attack ?

499
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:11,426
It's good news !

500
00:44:12,402 --> 00:44:13,922
According to my sources,

501
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:17,554
This idiot was here
Only for you.

502
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,978
You know who sent him?

503
00:44:20,466 --> 00:44:23,149
It is this fucker of Ko.

504
00:44:29,543 --> 00:44:30,809
That's it!

505
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,175
A heart attack.

506
00:44:36,418 --> 00:44:38,524
What are you going to do ?

507
00:44:38,784 --> 00:44:40,772
We take care of Ko,
when you leave ?

508
00:44:40,952 --> 00:44:42,625
I'll fix that.

509
00:44:45,259 --> 00:44:46,723
You have no mercy.

510
00:44:47,218 --> 00:44:49,999
You're talking about killing
Your own family, there!

511
00:44:50,102 --> 00:44:52,153
Family, my ass!

512
00:44:52,729 --> 00:44:56,468
When my father died,
He stuck me to the orphanage.

513
00:44:56,669 --> 00:44:57,839
Look!

514
00:44:58,131 --> 00:44:59,694
Look at that!

515
00:45:01,216 --> 00:45:04,108
I ordered spicy noodles
Instead of natural noodles

516
00:45:04,147 --> 00:45:08,257
And he hit me with an ashtray.

517
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:11,607
You deserved it then.

518
00:45:13,831 --> 00:45:17,098
That is true.
Natural noodles are better.

519
00:45:19,974 --> 00:45:25,614
If war is declared,
The guys will stay on the money side.

520
00:45:26,517 --> 00:45:30,254
Let's wait for the right moment.

521
00:45:31,152 --> 00:45:32,425
I can't take it anymore.

522
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:37,158
To make the lackey for this old fuck
makes me sick.

523
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:39,672
BTW,

524
00:45:40,618 --> 00:45:42,113
You inquired?

525
00:45:42,579 --> 00:45:44,700
About Jo Hyun-su?

526
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:48,644
He did good with the gang
Of the Golden Crane.

527
00:45:58,381 --> 00:45:59,814
Get out!

528
00:46:14,862 --> 00:46:16,629
They have balls ...

529
00:46:20,139 --> 00:46:23,285
Before sending him to the lawyer,
Clean his file.

530
00:46:25,403 --> 00:46:26,891
And Hyun-su, will it work?

531
00:46:26,988 --> 00:46:28,515
He is still alive.

532
00:46:29,504 --> 00:46:31,815
Where he is, that's difficult
to expose.

533
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:37,225
Better not inform him.
He could fuck up the plan.

534
00:46:37,265 --> 00:46:39,461
This is when his mother's operation?

535
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:45,374
Yes, I go to the hospital today.

536
00:46:45,748 --> 00:46:47,767
Thanks a lot Madam.

537
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:51,349
Yes.

538
00:46:53,284 --> 00:46:55,491
And Hyun-su, is he okay?

539
00:47:02,717 --> 00:47:04,081
You tan?

540
00:47:06,426 --> 00:47:08,220
It is so beautiful ...

541
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:14,317
Yes, what light.

542
00:47:40,338 --> 00:47:42,474
Are you kidding me, fucker!

543
00:47:42,499 --> 00:47:44,336
- Calm down !
- Bastard!

544
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:46,683
Why is she dead?

545
00:47:47,419 --> 00:47:48,813
Calm down.

546
00:47:49,458 --> 00:47:51,458
She can not be dead!

547
00:47:51,601 --> 00:47:52,942
Liar !

548
00:47:54,758 --> 00:47:56,598
I want to see my mother ...

549
00:47:56,623 --> 00:47:58,351
I want to see her.

550
00:47:59,819 --> 00:48:01,505
Sit down, Jo!

551
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:03,945
I want to see her, fuck!

552
00:48:06,003 --> 00:48:07,353
Take a seat !

553
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:29,843
Masked number

554
00:48:30,242 --> 00:48:31,817
<i>Let me out,</i>

555
00:48:32,496 --> 00:48:34,054
Just one day.

556
00:48:35,688 --> 00:48:38,460
Apart from me, she will not have anyone
At her funeral.

557
00:48:39,762 --> 00:48:43,162
<i>You are not an exemplary prisoner.
It will be hard.</i>

558
00:48:44,810 --> 00:48:47,234
And because of who I am here?

559
00:48:52,091 --> 00:48:53,618
I beg you.

560
00:48:53,837 --> 00:48:56,185
<i>I did everything
What you asked me.</i>

561
00:48:57,025 --> 00:48:59,189
I can not help you right now.

562
00:48:59,336 --> 00:49:00,721
Undercover agent

563
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:04,416
Do something else,
please.

564
00:49:06,242 --> 00:49:10,847
I've been languishing here for two years,
And I can not bury my mother?

565
00:49:16,986 --> 00:49:20,645
If you do not get me out,
I unveil everything.

566
00:49:23,445 --> 00:49:26,306
If I destroy your file,
You're just a bitch.

567
00:49:26,978 --> 00:49:28,997
<i>Is that what you want?</i>

568
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:32,223
How can you ...

569
00:49:33,622 --> 00:49:35,427
Do this to me...

570
00:49:35,922 --> 00:49:37,223
Hyun-su.

571
00:49:38,623 --> 00:49:40,904
It's not the time to make a child.

572
00:50:02,089 --> 00:50:03,498
Do not touch me.

573
00:50:07,115 --> 00:50:08,115
Yes...

574
00:50:09,575 --> 00:50:11,015
I understand.

575
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:12,250
What?

576
00:50:14,975 --> 00:50:16,796
You understand what?

577
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:21,560
Hey?

578
00:50:23,972 --> 00:50:27,168
You'll never understand me, asshole!

579
00:50:33,627 --> 00:50:35,297
Stop, or you'll regret it.

580
00:50:41,076 --> 00:50:42,674
What are you playing at ?

581
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,896
Motherfucker !

582
00:50:56,795 --> 00:50:58,362
Stop it now.

583
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:08,366
Bastard!

584
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:16,435
- Stop !
- Leave me !

585
00:51:40,305 --> 00:51:41,602
Stop.

586
00:52:14,252 --> 00:52:15,700
It's curious.

587
00:52:16,924 --> 00:52:18,729
It seems to me that it was yesterday

588
00:52:18,959 --> 00:52:20,606
That you and Han were threatening me.

589
00:52:22,499 --> 00:52:23,499
Drink.

590
00:52:27,256 --> 00:52:29,180
You have an exit permit.

591
00:52:30,654 --> 00:52:33,252
You will be escorted and handcuffed.

592
00:52:37,959 --> 00:52:39,637
This is the address of the funeral home.

593
00:52:42,330 --> 00:52:44,841
Han Jae-ho paid the funeral.

594
00:52:47,421 --> 00:52:51,537
He threatened me
To give you a few days.

595
00:52:52,908 --> 00:52:55,387
<i>But this is the work
of the Director.</i>

596
00:52:56,306 --> 00:52:58,080
<i>A few hours,
It's not so bad.</i>

597
00:53:45,991 --> 00:53:48,350
I don't even remember
The face of my father.

598
00:53:49,393 --> 00:53:52,356
She was everything to me.

599
00:53:54,812 --> 00:53:58,597
I feel completely abandoned.

600
00:54:01,742 --> 00:54:02,920
Let it go.

601
00:54:05,344 --> 00:54:07,212
You can not understand.

602
00:54:12,222 --> 00:54:17,079
You know who wanted to kill me
the first time ?

603
00:54:22,453 --> 00:54:24,266
The woman I called Mom.

604
00:54:25,952 --> 00:54:31,475
When he was drunk, my father beat us,
my mother and I.

605
00:54:32,924 --> 00:54:37,585
When he was sober, it's OK,
But he drank every day.

606
00:54:40,633 --> 00:54:42,240
When I was 12 years old,

607
00:54:43,362 --> 00:54:48,167
One day during the meal,
I felt something weird.

608
00:54:48,589 --> 00:54:52,615
The taste of the rice was bizarre.
My mother avoided my gaze.

609
00:54:53,909 --> 00:54:56,214
So I ran to the toilet

610
00:54:57,571 --> 00:55:00,328
And made myself vomit
with my fingers.

611
00:55:02,914 --> 00:55:04,394
When I came back,

612
00:55:05,984 --> 00:55:10,562
My parents were on the ground,

613
00:55:12,237 --> 00:55:14,317
with foam around their mouth.

614
00:55:16,554 --> 00:55:18,407
I am sorry...

615
00:55:22,472 --> 00:55:25,174
I, too, know what it is.
To be abandoned.

616
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:30,985
In any case, the moral of the story:

617
00:55:36,901 --> 00:55:38,817
Never believe anyone,

618
00:55:39,732 --> 00:55:42,479
Always believe the circumstances.

619
00:55:48,164 --> 00:55:49,850
When you get out of here,

620
00:55:51,048 --> 00:55:53,218
You really want to work
with me ?

621
00:55:56,062 --> 00:55:59,250
Fuck, if you say yes,

622
00:56:01,375 --> 00:56:02,874
let's do it. Okay ?

623
00:56:03,732 --> 00:56:06,626
Two solitaries must unite
To be strong.

624
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:09,680
You know,

625
00:56:10,350 --> 00:56:12,662
It would be cool to work with you.

626
00:56:14,637 --> 00:56:18,173
It does not mean
That you will be my lackey.

627
00:56:19,479 --> 00:56:21,974
Would you like to ? Do you agree?

628
00:56:23,306 --> 00:56:24,807
- On the other hand...
- Jae-ho ...

629
00:56:27,581 --> 00:56:29,130
I'm a cop.

630
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:36,819
<font color="#f6f900">127th day after release from prison</font>

631
00:56:37,341 --> 00:56:38,341
What is happening ?

632
00:56:38,376 --> 00:56:40,368
- We lost the signal.
- What?

633
00:56:41,941 --> 00:56:43,123
He got grilled?

634
00:56:43,131 --> 00:56:46,105
I do not think so.
His watch must be broken.

635
00:56:46,292 --> 00:56:47,292
Go ahead.

636
00:56:50,808 --> 00:56:54,304
<i>I do not know what you said</i>

637
00:56:54,992 --> 00:56:59,714
But I only unloaded 200 cartons
Of royal crabs.

638
00:57:01,717 --> 00:57:05,217
Even though I still agree
With Ko,

639
00:57:06,141 --> 00:57:09,201
I'd never do something like that.

640
00:57:25,221 --> 00:57:27,121
Can I call?

641
00:57:27,221 --> 00:57:28,221
Go ahead.

642
00:57:28,384 --> 00:57:31,748
We are in a free country.

643
00:57:33,367 --> 00:57:34,636
<i>Who is it?</i>

644
00:57:34,744 --> 00:57:38,655
Choi Dae-hyun, 45,
12 violent crimes and ...

645
00:57:39,635 --> 00:57:41,152
Captain Choi?

646
00:57:41,331 --> 00:57:42,525
Then ...

647
00:57:43,655 --> 00:57:45,878
He's a professional criminal.

648
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:48,913
It's too many big fish
For Hyun-su.

649
00:57:49,530 --> 00:57:50,796
What is their story?

650
00:57:50,819 --> 00:57:54,872
Ko tampered with official stamps
For his export documents

651
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:57,082
But Choi intercepted them.

652
00:57:58,154 --> 00:57:59,196
What stamps?

653
00:57:59,221 --> 00:58:02,926
Those of the customs of Busan
And port government.

654
00:58:03,174 --> 00:58:05,636
Customs officers are going to start a crisis.

655
00:58:06,395 --> 00:58:07,978
Should we not intervene?

656
00:58:08,655 --> 00:58:12,025
And spoil 3 years of undercover?

657
00:58:22,738 --> 00:58:25,339
This is Mr. Ko's last offer.

658
00:58:27,978 --> 00:58:32,479
Stop your delusions.
I have never seen these stamps.

659
00:58:34,358 --> 00:58:37,103
Look at the numbers,
You will love it.

660
00:58:37,833 --> 00:58:38,948
So that.

661
00:58:40,339 --> 00:58:43,776
You're a clown, you,
With your pretty face.

662
00:58:43,812 --> 00:58:45,601
Do I seem to joke?

663
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:21,603
Let's go.

664
00:59:22,385 --> 00:59:25,064
Why are you in such a hurry?

665
00:59:26,905 --> 00:59:29,409
Looks like you want to piss.

666
00:59:30,074 --> 00:59:32,374
We have to kill them all at once.

667
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,245
Are you afraid for your little protege?

668
01:00:08,109 --> 01:00:09,638
Not here!

669
01:00:11,651 --> 01:00:13,226
Do not come here.

670
01:00:28,152 --> 01:00:30,672
What are you waiting for?
Kill him!

671
01:00:32,103 --> 01:00:33,210
They're coming.

672
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:44,068
What do you have ?

673
01:00:45,307 --> 01:00:46,556
You want to go there ?

674
01:00:46,830 --> 01:00:48,996
I'll unwind my muscles.

675
01:00:49,171 --> 01:00:50,171
Jae-ho!

676
01:00:59,833 --> 01:01:01,492
Is everyone going?

677
01:01:01,936 --> 01:01:03,170
Good luck.

678
01:01:26,148 --> 01:01:28,446
Honey, it's me!

679
01:02:00,304 --> 01:02:01,494
Come here.

680
01:03:20,075 --> 01:03:21,501
What? Don't do that !

681
01:03:33,799 --> 01:03:34,913
Bitch !

682
01:03:35,769 --> 01:03:37,224
I almost got hurt.

683
01:03:38,077 --> 01:03:39,819
Me, I almost died.

684
01:03:41,342 --> 01:03:43,118
Get rid of that.

685
01:03:44,443 --> 01:03:45,615
Help me to get up.

686
01:03:45,631 --> 01:03:47,683
<i>Get it off first ...</i>

687
01:03:47,898 --> 01:03:50,714
<i>If you do not help me,
I can not move.</ I></i>

688
01:04:07,585 --> 01:04:08,665
Stop...

689
01:04:10,830 --> 01:04:13,171
Stay here ! Do not come near me!

690
01:04:13,499 --> 01:04:15,637
Do not hurt me.

691
01:04:41,755 --> 01:04:47,583
Stamps were found
And we took care of Choi.

692
01:04:48,246 --> 01:04:49,655
Nice work, Hyun-su.

693
01:04:49,735 --> 01:04:51,603
It was fun for me too.

694
01:04:51,988 --> 01:04:52,988
Fun?

695
01:04:54,753 --> 01:04:57,225
Did you hear what he said?

696
01:05:03,171 --> 01:05:05,707
He said it was fun!

697
01:06:14,765 --> 01:06:16,391
It's been a long time.

698
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:25,652
Is that fun here?

699
01:06:30,872 --> 01:06:31,872
Hello.

700
01:07:11,218 --> 01:07:13,219
Mr. Gegard is waiting for you.

701
01:07:17,014 --> 01:07:18,221
Cheers.

702
01:07:21,887 --> 01:07:23,005
Stay here.

703
01:07:51,815 --> 01:07:53,973
It's been a long time, Mr. Gegard.

704
01:07:55,053 --> 01:07:56,953
Nice to see you again, Han.

705
01:08:36,318 --> 01:08:37,484
You're crazy !

706
01:08:37,921 --> 01:08:39,396
What are you doing here?

707
01:08:40,951 --> 01:08:42,083
You're smart.

708
01:08:43,607 --> 01:08:45,511
Watch this time.

709
01:08:45,831 --> 01:08:47,807
I'm fed up, fucker.

710
01:08:49,099 --> 01:08:51,520
I'm under surveillance or what?

711
01:08:51,714 --> 01:08:55,429
Because of you,
Choi is still unconscious.

712
01:08:55,485 --> 01:08:57,845
We had to be covered!

713
01:08:57,869 --> 01:08:59,675
Send me back to jail, then.

714
01:08:59,691 --> 01:09:01,073
Son of a bitch!

715
01:09:02,376 --> 01:09:03,472
Jo Hyun-su!

716
01:09:05,926 --> 01:09:07,621
Crazy guy !

717
01:09:13,517 --> 01:09:14,953
What are you doing here ?

718
01:09:15,763 --> 01:09:19,288
The toilet was broken,
so I went out to piss.

719
01:09:19,304 --> 01:09:21,423
But this pervert checked me out

720
01:09:24,008 --> 01:09:25,190
My God...

721
01:09:25,587 --> 01:09:28,582
The company has evolved
But there are limits.

722
01:09:28,928 --> 01:09:30,726
It's a misunderstanding.

723
01:09:30,742 --> 01:09:31,956
You are wrong.

724
01:09:32,647 --> 01:09:34,412
Dirty pervert.

725
01:09:36,923 --> 01:09:38,946
You're wrong ...

726
01:09:39,417 --> 01:09:41,189
For playing peeping tom.

727
01:09:41,212 --> 01:09:42,212
Stop !

728
01:09:42,237 --> 01:09:43,816
That's enough now.

729
01:09:45,442 --> 01:09:49,019
Look at your cock.
Okay ? Son of a bitch!

730
01:09:52,918 --> 01:09:55,076
Did you see the cop's mouth?

731
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,986
He pissed on it.

732
01:10:03,128 --> 01:10:05,474
The hit of the pervert,
It was exaggerated.

733
01:10:19,666 --> 01:10:21,481
Why did he emerge like that?

734
01:10:21,847 --> 01:10:23,521
Because of the watch.

735
01:10:29,756 --> 01:10:32,375
- What do you have ?
- Do not move !

736
01:10:34,768 --> 01:10:36,846
Do not move !

737
01:10:39,448 --> 01:10:41,397
Raise your arms!

738
01:11:06,609 --> 01:11:08,319
Are you happy now?

739
01:11:17,429 --> 01:11:18,492
Shit!

740
01:11:55,874 --> 01:11:58,505
At your age, I was already on the field.

741
01:12:00,037 --> 01:12:01,442
You can not imagine

742
01:12:02,701 --> 01:12:05,885
The number of guys who betrayed me.

743
01:12:08,658 --> 01:12:13,958
Even Ko
To whom I dedicated 20 years of my life

744
01:12:19,408 --> 01:12:24,221
In my place,
Whom would you trust?

745
01:12:32,802 --> 01:12:34,876
OK I understand.

746
01:12:35,811 --> 01:12:39,139
I will never force you
To trust me.

747
01:12:47,122 --> 01:12:49,197
But I trust you.

748
01:13:01,615 --> 01:13:03,777
It's really cheesy here.

749
01:13:06,908 --> 01:13:10,262
But you know,
You're somebody right now.

750
01:13:16,790 --> 01:13:17,790
Somebody ?

751
01:13:24,782 --> 01:13:26,547
This is a new sample.

752
01:13:26,778 --> 01:13:28,314
An improved formula,

753
01:13:28,407 --> 01:13:31,165
90% pure and half price.

754
01:13:31,493 --> 01:13:34,680
If it was not illegal,
It would deserve the Nobel Prize.

755
01:13:36,646 --> 01:13:38,990
There is more to choose the day J,
my uncle.

756
01:13:40,066 --> 01:13:42,204
Let's do a big job this time.

757
01:13:42,598 --> 01:13:43,598
How many ?

758
01:13:45,260 --> 01:13:47,389
We think of 50 kg.

759
01:13:47,461 --> 01:13:48,461
50?

760
01:13:49,428 --> 01:13:52,106
We expand our network
And we cover the whole country.

761
01:13:52,447 --> 01:13:54,539
It will take a month
To find the money.

762
01:13:54,570 --> 01:13:57,954
Come on, God created the world
In six days.

763
01:13:59,153 --> 01:14:02,781
This jerk-off Cheon
Will come and sniff our ass.

764
01:14:07,415 --> 01:14:08,895
There's a way.

765
01:14:10,191 --> 01:14:11,881
<i> What is your plan? </ I></i>

766
01:14:12,275 --> 01:14:14,870
This cop con,
What are you going to do with it?

767
01:14:15,855 --> 01:14:17,279
Lower your voice.

768
01:14:20,383 --> 01:14:23,281
Girls !
This guy hangs around with a cop!

769
01:14:29,054 --> 01:14:31,824
You still have not told me
How did you do it.

770
01:14:33,681 --> 01:14:34,804
Do what ?

771
01:14:35,207 --> 01:14:38,324
Your cop, how did you shoot him?

772
01:14:43,634 --> 01:14:44,971
Jo Hyun-su?

773
01:14:45,109 --> 01:14:47,271
He was fine with the gang
Of the Golden Crane.

774
01:14:48,572 --> 01:14:51,682
But the trick is that ...

775
01:14:57,849 --> 01:15:00,798
I got pissed for this.

776
01:15:01,921 --> 01:15:06,184
I wanted to fuck
This jerk-off Cheon, you see ...

777
01:15:07,043 --> 01:15:08,043
Look!

778
01:15:08,773 --> 01:15:11,665
So I got this picture.

779
01:15:12,589 --> 01:15:13,933
Inspector Cheon.

780
01:15:14,158 --> 01:15:16,280
I take care of this bastard outside.

781
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:20,391
And that's for you.

782
01:15:21,738 --> 01:15:23,688
It's that simple.

783
01:15:30,587 --> 01:15:33,398
The cops are still
More cunning than us.

784
01:15:37,481 --> 01:15:38,533
What?

785
01:15:39,078 --> 01:15:41,666
It is too good
To be removed.

786
01:15:42,948 --> 01:15:45,147
He makes you bend?

787
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:49,576
I'll put it on our side.

788
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:53,716
He's a cop!
How do you plan to do this?

789
01:15:54,008 --> 01:15:56,160
Don't bother.

790
01:16:07,034 --> 01:16:09,503
<i>First I try,</ i></i>

791
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:13,743
And if it does not work

792
01:16:14,416 --> 01:16:16,114
I'll kill him.

793
01:16:16,845 --> 01:16:17,845
<i>Jae-ho.</i>

794
01:16:18,765 --> 01:16:20,338
I'm a cop.

795
01:16:25,022 --> 01:16:27,724
I know it's crazy on my part.

796
01:16:28,059 --> 01:16:30,589
You can break my neck
in just one time.

797
01:16:37,135 --> 01:16:39,454
But I do not want to lie to you.

798
01:16:46,524 --> 01:16:48,274
<i> I'm really sorry. </ I></i>

799
01:16:49,485 --> 01:16:52,372
So this idiot confessed
himself ?

800
01:16:53,517 --> 01:16:55,123
How did you do it?

801
01:16:56,216 --> 01:16:57,394
Relate.

802
01:16:57,762 --> 01:16:59,163
He's too nice.

803
01:17:00,522 --> 01:17:04,357
You and me,
We will never understand that.

804
01:17:18,153 --> 01:17:20,426
Jung Kyung-hee
1962 - 2014

805
01:17:47,672 --> 01:17:49,020
Who are you ?

806
01:17:49,737 --> 01:17:50,755
Who are you, dammit?

807
01:17:50,771 --> 01:17:52,314
Hey, pig.

808
01:17:55,857 --> 01:17:57,756
pig?
What are you talking about ?

809
01:17:57,780 --> 01:17:59,863
Han Jae-ho reveiled everything.

810
01:18:00,210 --> 01:18:01,210
What?

811
01:18:01,786 --> 01:18:04,214
In your opinion, who send us?

812
01:18:07,432 --> 01:18:08,785
Bring the gasoline.

813
01:18:13,481 --> 01:18:14,481
Tip over.

814
01:18:28,637 --> 01:18:31,013
Do you have a last will?

815
01:18:31,721 --> 01:18:33,685
I'll give you 5 seconds.

816
01:18:33,993 --> 01:18:35,235
- 5 ...
- Hold on !

817
01:18:35,305 --> 01:18:37,062
4 ... 3 ...

818
01:18:37,095 --> 01:18:38,077
How did he know?

819
01:18:38,093 --> 01:18:40,547
- How did Han Jea-ho learn it?
- 2 ... 1!

820
01:19:03,628 --> 01:19:04,925
What, a test?

821
01:19:07,781 --> 01:19:09,292
Was this a test?

822
01:19:10,967 --> 01:19:13,835
Didn't you put me in jail?

823
01:19:14,146 --> 01:19:16,758
Want to burn me again?

824
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:21,657
Hey, pervert.

825
01:19:23,093 --> 01:19:25,326
You took your revenge!

826
01:19:26,196 --> 01:19:28,291
You really talk
Like a gangster.

827
01:19:28,323 --> 01:19:31,025
Do 3 years of prison,
we will speak again !

828
01:19:31,511 --> 01:19:33,269
- Son of a bitch.
- Stop.

829
01:19:38,845 --> 01:19:40,594
The D-Day is fixed?

830
01:19:42,425 --> 01:19:44,769
Han tries to convince Ko.

831
01:19:45,001 --> 01:19:47,953
As soon as he agrees,
The Russians set a date.

832
01:19:49,613 --> 01:19:50,733
The amount ?

833
01:19:51,464 --> 01:19:52,610
About 50.

834
01:19:58,766 --> 01:20:01,150
And who killed my mother?

835
01:20:02,776 --> 01:20:05,674
Hit and Run always ends up pin down

836
01:20:06,114 --> 01:20:08,503
We put pressure on the investigators,

837
01:20:08,921 --> 01:20:10,618
Have more patience.

838
01:20:24,061 --> 01:20:26,005
<font color="#f6f900">A year ago</font>

839
01:20:26,084 --> 01:20:27,999
<font color="#f6f900">The day of the accident</font>

840
01:20:33,073 --> 01:20:34,838
We must tell the truth to Hyun-su.

841
01:20:34,847 --> 01:20:38,232
If we told him,
It will make his mother come back?

842
01:20:41,504 --> 01:20:45,352
Even if we work undercover,
It goes too far.

843
01:20:46,397 --> 01:20:48,148
Bullshit!

844
01:21:05,927 --> 01:21:07,486
Listen to me carefully.

845
01:21:09,363 --> 01:21:13,025
As long as the fault is not revealed,
No one is guilty.

846
01:21:14,345 --> 01:21:18,360
<i>The culprit,
is the one who gets it.</i>

847
01:21:21,344 --> 01:21:23,804
<i>No sentiment for the bloody idiot.</i>

848
01:21:25,972 --> 01:21:28,353
<i>Otherwise you run at your loss.</i>

849
01:21:39,762 --> 01:21:41,242
What are you doing ?

850
01:21:42,015 --> 01:21:44,439
You repeat a role or what?

851
01:21:44,586 --> 01:21:47,018
What happened to you ?

852
01:21:52,399 --> 01:21:54,593
It's a long story.

853
01:21:55,679 --> 01:21:56,679
Let's get out.

854
01:22:35,650 --> 01:22:36,650
Jae-ho.

855
01:22:37,644 --> 01:22:39,869
You're not fed up
To live like that?

856
01:22:40,029 --> 01:22:41,029
How?

857
01:22:41,855 --> 01:22:47,414
Sometimes your way of life
Makes me sorry.

858
01:22:50,125 --> 01:22:53,332
I don't live like that to live
But to survive.

859
01:22:55,219 --> 01:22:57,699
Things that turn your life upside down

860
01:22:58,380 --> 01:23:00,585
Always arrive at your back.

861
01:23:01,741 --> 01:23:03,911
Never before you.

862
01:23:04,925 --> 01:23:05,925
You must...

863
01:23:07,589 --> 01:23:09,561
Always watch your back.

864
01:23:12,654 --> 01:23:13,816
That is true...

865
01:23:15,543 --> 01:23:18,600
I never believed
That my mother would go that way.

866
01:23:21,827 --> 01:23:23,457
If it had not happened,

867
01:23:24,211 --> 01:23:26,174
You would not be by my side.

868
01:24:23,792 --> 01:24:27,330
<i>Given the quantity of dope,
It will go very fast.</i>

869
01:24:27,512 --> 01:24:29,470
<i>You'll only have one chance.</i>

870
01:24:29,701 --> 01:24:31,067
<i>Are you sure about the info?</i>

871
01:24:31,088 --> 01:24:33,036
<i>It has been hard to get downstream.</i>

872
01:24:33,333 --> 01:24:36,319
<i>The police, the sea guard,
Customs, SWAT ...</i>

873
01:24:36,383 --> 01:24:38,042
<i>It's a blockbuster.</i>

874
01:24:38,721 --> 01:24:41,299
Make it a hit at the box office then.

875
01:24:43,584 --> 01:24:46,320
<font color="#f6f900">150th day after release from prison</font>

876
01:24:47,446 --> 01:24:49,979
<font color="#f6f900">D-DAY</ font>

877
01:24:53,469 --> 01:24:54,865
Let's go !

878
01:25:37,754 --> 01:25:39,342
Thank you very much !

879
01:26:34,275 --> 01:26:35,768
Hi guys !

880
01:26:58,828 --> 01:27:00,713
Not bad.

881
01:27:02,291 --> 01:27:04,503
It's been a long time, Mr. Ko!

882
01:27:10,921 --> 01:27:14,804
What are you waiting for?
On your knees, assholes!

883
01:27:20,103 --> 01:27:21,313
Stop them!

884
01:27:30,597 --> 01:27:32,442
Reach the crates!

885
01:27:40,343 --> 01:27:43,874
Mr. Ko, how's your rheumatism?

886
01:27:46,259 --> 01:27:47,595
Open it to me.

887
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:00,931
I like that.

888
01:28:01,009 --> 01:28:03,070
You want to use it with me?

889
01:28:31,260 --> 01:28:34,948
The sailors had to feel lonely.

890
01:28:35,279 --> 01:28:37,171
With all my respect.

891
01:28:38,865 --> 01:28:40,202
Mr. Gegard!

892
01:28:52,922 --> 01:28:54,043
Shit.

893
01:29:09,185 --> 01:29:12,915
It takes 2 hours for the salt to melt,
that's it ?

894
01:29:13,601 --> 01:29:15,764
It's almost time.

895
01:29:16,141 --> 01:29:17,168
OK.

896
01:29:17,329 --> 01:29:22,002
Hyun-su is really smart.
Maybe because he's young.

897
01:29:24,075 --> 01:29:26,801
What genius transmitted the info
to Cheon ...

898
01:29:28,458 --> 01:29:29,596
By chance...

899
01:29:31,129 --> 01:29:34,009
Curiosity is a bad thing.
Yes it's me.

900
01:29:37,927 --> 01:29:40,520
I confirm the amount.

901
01:29:40,598 --> 01:29:44,009
Now check the merchandise.

902
01:29:52,505 --> 01:29:53,722
Checked.

903
01:29:54,136 --> 01:29:55,136
Very good.

904
01:29:59,459 --> 01:30:01,343
Clink glasses, Mr. Ko.

905
01:30:02,016 --> 01:30:04,465
Of course, thank you!

906
01:30:05,357 --> 01:30:06,757
Beautiful work, Jae-ho.

907
01:30:06,879 --> 01:30:08,894
Let's get out of here tonight.

908
01:30:10,890 --> 01:30:12,521
Cheers

909
01:30:17,981 --> 01:30:19,035
Boss.

910
01:30:20,603 --> 01:30:23,011
I do not drink with a corpse.

911
01:30:24,729 --> 01:30:26,153
What are you doing ?

912
01:30:26,885 --> 01:30:27,913
Han ...

913
01:30:31,444 --> 01:30:32,908
My apologies.

914
01:30:33,666 --> 01:30:35,456
Traitor.

915
01:31:17,122 --> 01:31:18,939
Take care of the dope.

916
01:31:19,150 --> 01:31:22,073
You, take care of your protege.

917
01:31:24,133 --> 01:31:25,256
Look!

918
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:28,445
This one is not dead.

919
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:30,548
Good work !

920
01:31:31,589 --> 01:31:33,232
Is he one of us?

921
01:32:08,034 --> 01:32:09,339
It's okay ?

922
01:32:12,238 --> 01:32:13,510
It hurts !

923
01:32:13,558 --> 01:32:16,126
Bitch ! It rocks !

924
01:32:17,017 --> 01:32:18,742
Do we have to go that far?

925
01:32:23,729 --> 01:32:24,918
Again ?

926
01:32:26,138 --> 01:32:28,380
You're really a sick person.

927
01:32:39,829 --> 01:32:42,404
I was hit during the raid

928
01:32:43,868 --> 01:32:46,594
But the inspector does not give a damn.

929
01:32:54,005 --> 01:32:55,778
Bring me Hyun-su.

930
01:32:55,810 --> 01:32:58,496
<i>He took 2 hits.
He can be sewed up again.</i>

931
01:32:58,529 --> 01:33:00,990
And then, it's not in the head!

932
01:33:18,723 --> 01:33:20,186
What is that ?

933
01:34:13,919 --> 01:34:15,601
Do you recognize him?

934
01:34:32,129 --> 01:34:33,251
Why...

935
01:34:34,064 --> 01:34:35,916
Why did not you tell me?

936
01:34:36,310 --> 01:34:37,761
Why ?

937
01:34:37,794 --> 01:34:40,435
So you do not screw up the operation.

938
01:34:40,844 --> 01:34:43,141
It's fucked up anyway.

939
01:34:44,852 --> 01:34:46,383
Why are you doing this to me ?

940
01:34:47,657 --> 01:34:48,610
Calm down.

941
01:34:48,626 --> 01:34:51,503
Bitch!
Why are you doing this to me ?

942
01:34:51,543 --> 01:34:53,182
You know it well.

943
01:34:54,024 --> 01:34:56,676
What are you going to do
With your mother's murderer?

944
01:34:57,783 --> 01:34:58,974
Calm down.

945
01:35:01,621 --> 01:35:03,251
If it had not happened,

946
01:35:03,970 --> 01:35:05,865
You would not be by my side.

947
01:35:10,523 --> 01:35:11,781
Stop!

948
01:35:12,786 --> 01:35:14,408
No !

949
01:35:32,295 --> 01:35:34,410
The moral of the story :

950
01:35:35,786 --> 01:35:37,853
Never believe anyone,

951
01:35:39,575 --> 01:35:41,642
Always believe the circumstances.

952
01:35:42,872 --> 01:35:44,296
Circumstances.

953
01:35:53,826 --> 01:35:54,826
We are...

954
01:35:54,929 --> 01:35:57,136
A family !

955
01:36:11,186 --> 01:36:12,979
It's classified, buddy!

956
01:36:18,438 --> 01:36:19,624
Let's drink !

957
01:36:21,596 --> 01:36:22,995
Thank you boss.

958
01:36:28,565 --> 01:36:32,163
My friend,
Co-directing is not uncommon these days.

959
01:36:34,266 --> 01:36:36,229
But it's not our style.

960
01:36:38,787 --> 01:36:40,553
- We are...
- A family !

961
01:36:50,709 --> 01:36:52,780
There is a problem ?

962
01:36:53,630 --> 01:36:54,630
<i> Jae-ho. </i>

963
01:36:56,446 --> 01:36:59,538
<i>We're going to investigate.
You're in danger.</i>

964
01:37:02,297 --> 01:37:03,753
What are you saying ?

965
01:37:03,790 --> 01:37:05,531
I think they sold me out.

966
01:37:07,532 --> 01:37:10,202
Someone else know
My real identity?

967
01:37:17,937 --> 01:37:21,483
<i>A warrant will be issued tomorrow
For a jacked search.</i>

968
01:37:21,689 --> 01:37:23,683
<i>Shoot us Today
With the dope.</i>

969
01:37:27,064 --> 01:37:30,498
See you later, I'll tell you when.
See you where you know.

970
01:37:38,299 --> 01:37:39,739
<i>Yes, see you later.</i>

971
01:37:43,056 --> 01:37:44,471
Are we asking for reinforcement?

972
01:37:44,503 --> 01:37:46,972
If the hierarchy learns,
We're in deep shit.

973
01:37:47,004 --> 01:37:48,408
Our target is Han Jae-ho.

974
01:37:48,442 --> 01:37:50,470
About how many guys
Can we count on?

975
01:37:50,483 --> 01:37:53,131
About three.
Will they really come?

976
01:38:20,402 --> 01:38:21,900
What is that ?

977
01:38:23,248 --> 01:38:25,121
He calls me and he is not there?

978
01:38:33,935 --> 01:38:35,463
President.

979
01:38:40,640 --> 01:38:43,033
It's nice. Really nice.

980
01:39:00,927 --> 01:39:02,383
Give me that.

981
01:39:17,815 --> 01:39:18,945
Jae-ho!

982
01:39:35,408 --> 01:39:36,519
Jae-ho ...

983
01:39:38,899 --> 01:39:41,011
Jo Hyun-su, that asshole ...

984
01:39:41,801 --> 01:39:43,543
I'm going to kill him ...

985
01:39:45,071 --> 01:39:46,146
Jae-ho ...

986
01:39:48,705 --> 01:39:50,024
Don't do that.

987
01:39:53,290 --> 01:39:55,825
You're blind, man.

988
01:39:59,950 --> 01:40:01,224
My friend...

989
01:40:03,254 --> 01:40:04,980
Wake up !

990
01:40:05,291 --> 01:40:06,291
Shit.

991
01:40:18,832 --> 01:40:20,915
You're not my buddy.

992
01:40:22,212 --> 01:40:24,017
Bitch!

993
01:40:37,706 --> 01:40:38,868
Jae-ho ...

994
01:40:42,163 --> 01:40:44,532
You're fighting ...

995
01:40:47,123 --> 01:40:49,944
Stop, I beg you!

996
01:41:16,370 --> 01:41:17,842
Young-geun.

997
01:41:18,543 --> 01:41:21,055
You're not fed up
To live like that?

998
01:41:25,178 --> 01:41:26,467
You can go.

999
01:43:05,490 --> 01:43:07,243
What the hell is he doing?

1000
01:43:30,547 --> 01:43:32,384
Have you been waiting for a long time?

1001
01:43:34,717 --> 01:43:36,745
I am a little late.

1002
01:43:39,543 --> 01:43:40,543
Hello.

1003
01:43:42,671 --> 01:43:44,151
Did you see the rain?

1004
01:43:45,071 --> 01:43:46,280
Do not laugh!

1005
01:43:48,866 --> 01:43:50,552
It's better ?

1006
01:43:53,502 --> 01:43:57,112
You shot me.
You should know.

1007
01:44:04,576 --> 01:44:06,771
Yes, you paid dearly.

1008
01:44:09,820 --> 01:44:11,637
On the road,

1009
01:44:12,323 --> 01:44:17,154
I saw a tank truck
In the middle of the cars.

1010
01:44:17,879 --> 01:44:18,879
Shit.

1011
01:44:20,605 --> 01:44:26,018
Tank trucks
Have tinted windows now?

1012
01:44:29,411 --> 01:44:31,462
Are you still suspicious of me?

1013
01:44:41,136 --> 01:44:42,330
Dig me.

1014
01:44:54,894 --> 01:44:56,501
I am really fed up...

1015
01:44:57,912 --> 01:44:59,487
To live like that.

1016
01:45:01,386 --> 01:45:02,386
Hyun-su!

1017
01:45:03,129 --> 01:45:07,579
Sell ​​all the dope
And leave the business.

1018
01:45:13,737 --> 01:45:14,737
No.

1019
01:45:16,557 --> 01:45:18,832
You're cut for this job.

1020
01:45:21,118 --> 01:45:24,487
Kill traitors,
Kill competitors,

1021
01:45:24,870 --> 01:45:27,091
Kill all people
That you do not like ...

1022
01:45:30,605 --> 01:45:33,012
About that,
Byung-gab is still alive?

1023
01:45:40,554 --> 01:45:43,119
I was even told
That you had killed my mother.

1024
01:46:11,152 --> 01:46:12,441
That is true,

1025
01:46:15,816 --> 01:46:17,709
I was really blinded.

1026
01:46:19,596 --> 01:46:20,596
Yes.

1027
01:46:21,831 --> 01:46:26,086
I should have killed you from the start.

1028
01:46:28,748 --> 01:46:29,871
I should have.

1029
01:46:40,541 --> 01:46:41,854
Bitch...

1030
01:46:46,582 --> 01:46:47,582
I will have...

1031
01:46:49,230 --> 01:46:50,305
Well done ...

1032
01:46:52,999 --> 01:46:54,812
That you never find it.

1033
01:46:57,181 --> 01:46:58,381
You're hesitating ?

1034
01:47:01,536 --> 01:47:03,413
Do you feel guilty?

1035
01:47:16,648 --> 01:47:18,557
If you want to shoot, hurry.

1036
01:47:18,882 --> 01:47:20,957
The cops will soon disembark.

1037
01:47:31,019 --> 01:47:32,019
The plan,

1038
01:47:34,038 --> 01:47:36,790
was to go down check
the goods,

1039
01:47:37,064 --> 01:47:39,036
And there they arrest you.

1040
01:47:40,507 --> 01:47:42,526
I blew it.

1041
01:48:01,104 --> 01:48:02,493
Bitch.

1042
01:48:22,848 --> 01:48:24,574
Where is Han Jae-ho?

1043
01:48:56,603 --> 01:48:58,553
Where is he ?

1044
01:48:59,373 --> 01:49:00,924
Show yourself !

1045
01:49:20,850 --> 01:49:23,991
Give me your gun,
This is the only way out.

1046
01:49:27,254 --> 01:49:30,861
Poor cunt, you want to die?

1047
01:49:31,315 --> 01:49:33,773
It's too big of a fish
for you.

1048
01:50:08,156 --> 01:50:09,366
Are you scared ?

1049
01:50:09,599 --> 01:50:11,085
Shut your mouth !

1050
01:50:26,832 --> 01:50:29,886
Stop being stupid !

1051
01:50:58,343 --> 01:51:00,703
If you do not kill me, you're done.

1052
01:51:35,483 --> 01:51:38,108
<i>At your age, I was already on the field.</i>

1053
01:51:39,582 --> 01:51:41,164
<i>You can not imagine</i>

1054
01:51:42,315 --> 01:51:45,236
<i>the number of guys who betrayed me.</i>

1055
01:51:46,863 --> 01:51:48,286
<i>Okay, I understand.</i>

1056
01:51:48,709 --> 01:51:52,551
<i>I will never force you
To trust me.</i>

1057
01:51:55,430 --> 01:51:57,505
<i>But I trust you.</i>

1058
01:52:00,174 --> 01:52:01,174
<i>Jae-ho.</i>

1059
01:52:01,787 --> 01:52:03,884
<i>You know, you're somebody now.</i>

1060
01:52:04,101 --> 01:52:05,101
<i>Somebody?</i>

1061
01:52:54,422 --> 01:52:55,473
Han Jae-ho.

1062
01:52:58,046 --> 01:52:59,494
Where is the merchandise?

1063
01:53:46,812 --> 01:53:47,812
Its good.

1064
01:53:57,117 --> 01:53:58,117
Jo Hyun-su.

1065
01:54:01,189 --> 01:54:02,189
Hold on...

1066
01:55:05,591 --> 01:55:06,709
Hyun-su ...

1067
01:55:11,270 --> 01:55:12,270
You...

1068
01:55:14,879 --> 01:55:17,457
Do not do
The same mistakes that I made.
