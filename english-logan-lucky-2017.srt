John Denver, he was

3
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:04,231
playin' at this little ol' place called
the Cellar Door in Washington, D.C...

Christmas time in 1970.

5
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,663
His opening act was
this husband and wife duo,

6
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,408
named Bill Danoff
and Taffy Nivert

7
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,914

themself Fat City.

11
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:30,390
Now, one night, they decide
to go on back to the house

12
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:32,559
and have a little
jam session.

13
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,062
On the way,
they got into an accident

14
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:38,391
and John Denver,
he broke his thumb.

15
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:40,943
And when they finally
got back to the house,

16
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:42,520
and Bill and Taffy
played him,

17
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:45,732
played John Denver this song
they'd been working on,

18
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:48,238
he flipped for it, man.

19
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,619
And they worked on
that thing till dawn.

20
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:51,695
Screwdriver.

21
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:54,031
Flat head or Phillips?
Flat.

22
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:56,538
So that's why
you like the song.

23
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:59,871
Well, I like the song
because of the song.

24
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,376
I mean, I guess I also like it

25
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,215
'cause it's got
a story behind it.

26

You know,
Bill Danoff later said that

27
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,220
he ain't never even
been to West Virginia.

28
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,139
Well, I like
the song, too,

29
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:14,514
but I don't really think
it'll work for the pageant.

32
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:18,563
Needle.

Yeah. I'm gonna pick
you up right after work.

35

Just so you know,
I asked Mommy

36
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:33,032
if she and Moody would
pay for your cell phone.

37
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,910
She said even if they did,
you wouldn't take it.

list it on your paperwork

No.

a liability issue.

What is that, two to three feet?

if you're gonna go to
Charleston, then, duh,

91
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,736
you get on the 85 to Danville,

92
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,819
then the I-19
to Charleston. 54 miles.

stretch outside of Julian.

I took the 85 to Danville,

100
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,629
but then I hopped onto the 3,

101

so instead of
goin' up and over,

102

up right, so what did they do?

when you think about it,

970
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:39,762
your body is your
operating system.

971
01:00:40,137 --> 01:00:43,061
So when your OS may
feel like it's working fine,

972
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:46,019
a problem with software can make
your computer not perform properly.

973

Even crash.

So eating only clean software,

01:08:54,088 --> 01:08:55,715
that I wasn't
thinking about science!

1111
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:58,267
Now, you said yourself
we couldn't bring in

1112
01:08:58,384 --> 01:09:00,261
normal explosives
'cause of the security!

1113
01:09:00,928 --> 01:09:04,273
Now, to make our bang,
we need potassium chlorate.

1114
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:06,730
Bleach pens is
pure sodium hypochlorite.

1115
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:11,030
Combined with the potassium
chloride in the salt substitute,

1116
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:14,613
we have created
an equal exchange of ions.

1117
01:09:14,942 --> 01:09:18,446
Sugar, plus potassium chlorate

1118
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:20,123
yields...

1119
01:09:26,621 --> 01:09:28,794
...two gasses and

1120
01:09:30,792 --> 01:09:32,135
a solid.

1121
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:35,634
Now, you throw in some heat,
you get energy.

1122
01:09:35,963 --> 01:09:38,887
Energy means light, explosion,

1123
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:41,469
or, as I like to call it...

1124

I was going to use

1126
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:52,488

or something?

1127
01:09:55,817 --> 01:09:58,570

01:38:31,989 --> 01:38:34,663
Clyde Logan drives through the
window of a Corner Save Mart

1530
01:38:35,660 --> 01:38:38,379
and ends up being sentenced
to 90 days here.

1531
01:38:39,497 --> 01:38:43,001
You seem to have a lot of information
in your FBI folders there.

1532
01:38:45,753 --> 01:38:46,754
And so?

1533
01:38:47,255 --> 01:38:49,508
You don't think that's
an incredible coincidence?

1534
01:38:53,010 --> 01:38:54,853
No. Not really.

1535
01:38:55,513 --> 01:38:59,734
I mean, if you're asking me, am I shocked
that the criminals locked up in here

1536
01:38:59,809 --> 01:39:01,982
are friends with other criminals?
No, I'm not.

1537
01:39:07,358 --> 01:39:10,737
So Clyde Logan and Joseph Bang
were incarcerated here

1538
01:39:10,820 --> 01:39:12,538
at your prison
on May the 28th.

1539
01:39:12,613 --> 01:39:14,536
And you had no problems,

1540
01:39:14,782 --> 01:39:18,207
no issues of any kind
at your prison on that day?

1541
01:39:18,286 --> 01:39:19,458
Is that right?

1542
01:39:19,537 --> 01:39:21,460
No, we didn't have
any problems.

1543
01:39:21,539 --> 01:39:23,712
Right. 'Cause Monroe
County Fire Department

1544
01:39:23,791 --> 01:39:25,151
said they
dispatched multiple units

1545
01:39:25,209 --> 01:39:27,303
around 8:30 p.m. that night.

1546
01:39:27,378 --> 01:39:29,346
There was
a small kitchen fire,

1547
01:39:29,422 --> 01:39:32,301
but that's not a problem
in the context of this prison.

1548
01:39:33,301 --> 01:39:35,099
I mean, it's
standard operating procedure

1549
01:39:35,178 --> 01:39:38,307
for them to
dispatch multiple units

1550
01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:40,482
any time there's
a fire at the prison.

1551
01:39:41,392 --> 01:39:45,238
That was no big deal.
It was out within a few minutes.

1552

You're certain
that these two inmates

couldn't have
broken out of here,

1554
01:39:52,570 --> 01:39:55,164
robbed the Speedway and then
broken back into your prison

Sure.

1645

was actually stolen.

Yeah.

I've been learning a lot. Like how
gelato isn't just fancy ice cream.

1700
01:52:00,881 --> 01:52:02,849
It's made at a slower
churn rate than ice cream,

1701
01:52:02,925 --> 01:52:04,723
so less air gets mixed in.

1702
01:52:04,801 --> 01:52:07,304
That's why it has
such a silky texture.

01:52:09,139 --> 01:52:12,143
Yeah, a churn rate. How fast the
paddle in the machine moves.

1705
01:52:12,392 --> 01:52:14,895
Sometimes the paddle
is called a dasher.

Oh, yeah, no,
I know what that is. A dasher.

Dasher and Dancer and Vixen.

No, Daddy!

No, it's not that.
