Good. I'll show you

00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,967
You're not like
our usual recruits.

369

I'm sure you will.

374
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,964
But someone like you

here by choice.

Well, I suppose
it doesn't matter.

379

Torn apart by hatred
between the races.

385
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,044
And as a result,
the world is in chaos.

386
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,964

to make the sacrifices

387

Here, we deal in

You'll be trained

to exploit that weakness
through seduction...

Since your birth,
the state nourished it.

Now the state asks
something in return.

405
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,041
You must learn to sacrifice

beyond all limitation...

407
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,011

the sentimental morality

00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,487
He's not exactly
match-fit.

717
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:56,086
He swims
every afternoon.

718
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:59,801
Logs his time.
But he drinks too much.

719
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:04,451
He looks
at pornography.

720
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,923
Nothing out of
the ordinary.

721
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:11,082
Anal. Threesomes.

722
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:13,720
Usually two men on a girl.

723
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,003
No relationships
to speak of.

724
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,891
A few girls he's paid,
couple of times...

725
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,804
but then he feels guilty
and over-tips.

726
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:26,131
Perhaps we'd have
more success

727
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,202

what we were looking for.

728

cooperation of my office.

729

I hope that you will...

I think.

at the pool, I guess.

Registered as a translator
for the Embassy.

788
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:38,890
But her real name
is Dominika Egorova.

789
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:42,090
She used to dance
with the Bolshoi.

790
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:44,811
There's officially no record
of her being SVR...

791
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,962
but that's bullshit.
She's here for Marble.
I know it.

792
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:49,361
Stay away from her.
I think she's valuable.

00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:50,487
And now you think
she's recruitable?

794
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:51,561
Maybe.

795
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:53,130

back into play.

00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:11,530

804

exposing themselves
on the Internet.

806
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:16,044
Why would she use
her real name?

807
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,486
Because
she's an innocent.

808
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:20,047
Or because
ifs a provocation.

809
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,009

Mmm-hmm?

If she does
let you fuck her,
she's definitely SVR...

817
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,165

way out of your league.

you give me

on your back by now.

826
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:03,767
You know...

827
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:07,003
there were always stories
about Sparrows.

828
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:11,409

01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:04,560
That's what it smells like,
when you butcher an animal.

1071
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:07,328
I took my time with her.

1072
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:12,530
So you would see what happens
when you tell secrets.

1073
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:15,081
(CRYING)
Please, please, please.

1074
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:17,288
This is your only warning.

1075
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:19,847
Now...

1076
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:21,800
call the police.

1077

1078
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:32,884
Where the fuck
have you been?

1079
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:41,681
Close your door.

1080
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,604
So, Marble surfaced.

1081
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:52,762
Jesus Christ. Here?

1082
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:54,361

1083

You don't say anything?

1084
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,240
What is that?

1085
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:58,561
It's a warning.

1086
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:01,924
MARTY:
She is a fucking Sparrow.

1087
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:03,684
Told you she was
way out of your league.

1088
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:06,121
I think
she's still recruitable.

1089
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:07,691
Now that we know
what we're dealing with,

1090
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:08,841
maybe even more so.

1091
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,047
If she's a Sparrow...

1092
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:12,567
we can't trust a fucking
word that comes out
other mouth.

1093
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:13,721
(PHONE RINGING)

1094
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:15,926
Yeah.

1095
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,081
When?

1096
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:20,926
DETECTIVE: <i>And you came home
to find her like this?</i>

1097
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:23,044
Yes.

1098
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:28,130
DETECTIVE: This wasn't
just a break-in.

1099
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:30,607
This was torture,
punishment.

1100
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:33,127
Any idea why someone
would do this to her?

1101
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:38,728
What happened
to your eye?

1102
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:43,370
Did you
get along with her?

1103
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:47,644
You seem upset.
Of course I'm fucking upset!

1104

you're shielding...

whoever you are
scared of...

1109
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:05,728
we can protect you.
May I go?

1110
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:12,761
NATE: I'm assuming
you guys were pretty close.

1111
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:16,647
You must be pretty scared.

1112
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:18,810
For yourself.

1113
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,240
When I was in Moscow,

1114
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:23,608
they talked about a program
that Khrushchev had set up.

1115
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:28,049
Young officers. Trained to
seduce and manipulate.

1116
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:29,850
They called 'em Sparrows.

1117
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:32,164
That is what
she was, right?

1118
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:34,488
The thing I just cannot
wrap my head around...

1119
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:37,684
is why a man
would put his niece

1120
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:39,330
through somethin‘
like that.

1121
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:50,043
I was told
to take a man to a hotel.

1122
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:51,730
To get information.

1123
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:56,451
They said he was
an enemy of the state.

1124
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:58,281
And in exchange,

1125
01:20:58,360 --> 01:21:00,522
my mother would get
the doctor she needed.

1126
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:06,646
Instead, they cut his throat,
and he died on top of me.

1127
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:13,367
There could be no witnesses,
so my uncle gave me a choice.

1128
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:16,649
Die, or become a Sparrow.

1129
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:19,049
What they did to Marta
was a message.

1130
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:21,248
They cut her open to show me
what they'll do to me...

1131
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:22,765
if I don't give them
what they want.

1132
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:24,968
What do they want?
A name.

1133
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:26,531
They think you're
running an agent.

1134
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:28,120
What do you think?

1135
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:29,685
I don't care.

1136
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:32,564
I just want
my mother to be safe.

1137
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:34,404
The men that you work for,
men like your uncle...

1138
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,608
they'll never let you go
no matterwhat you give them.

1139
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:38,524
It's how they function.

1140
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:40,808
You only matter because of
what you can do forthem.

1141
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,731
You don’t exist
unless they say so.

1142
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:49,045
And not just now. I mean,
when you were dancing...

1143
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:51,566
you were dancing for them.

1144
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:53,125
Because they were
Iettin‘ you.

1145
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:54,486
I mean,
you see it now, right?

1146
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:57,411
You belonged to them,
pretty much your whole life.

1147
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:04,682
So, Dominika, work with me.

1148
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:08,488
Make this something
that you own

1149
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:10,767
for the first time
in your life.

1150
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:15,609
And make them
fucking pay.

1151
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:17,171
What is it
you want from me?

1152
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:18,924
Whatever you can give us.

1153
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:21,043
But if I had my choice...

1154
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:22,770

1156
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:28,488
ls that any different
from being his?

1157
01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:31,484
Yeah, because I would never
ask you to do what he did.

1158
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:33,369
Nothing's worth that.

1159
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:36,844
I need to sleep.

1160
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,650
Why don't you
take my room?

1161
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:49,690
You know, you asked me
why I fired the gun
in Moscow?

1162
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:53,640
Well, the man

I was protecting
had everything to lose.

1163
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:56,041
He was benefiting
from the system.“

1164
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:58,846
but when he saw what was
happening in his name...

1165
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,128
he didn't just say
that he didn't know.

1166
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:03,647
He risked his life.
He risked everything.

1167
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:06,007
He didn't deserve to die
in a cellar somewhere.

1168
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:07,764
If you do this...

1169
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:10,486

in my power
to protect you.

the night before,
I couldn't sleep.

And I played this music
in my room...

and, after I fell asleep,
I dreamed that...

1183
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:37,650

and I could paint...
