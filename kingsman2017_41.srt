0:0:29.175 --> 0:0:31.311
(GROANING)

3
0:0:37.149 --> 0:0:38.651
(POWERING DOWN)

4
0:0:42.721 --> 0:0:43.989
Give me the code!

5
0:0:44.023 --> 0:0:45.958
I can't.

6
0:0:45.992 --> 0:0:47.760
Only Poppy knows it.

7
0:0:47.792 --> 0:0:49.595
Well, then you're no use
to me, are you?

8
0:0:50.262 --> 0:0:51.396
For the record, Charlie...

9
0:0:51.430 --> 0:0:54.767
I'm more of a gentleman
than you'll ever be.

10
0:0:54.801 --> 0:0:57.370
But right now, it's time
to drop the gentle bit.

11
0:0:58.538 --> 0:1:0.006
This is for Kingsman.

12
0:1:1.007 --> 0:1:2.609
For my mate Brandon.

13
0:1:3.342 --> 0:1:5.176
For Roxy.

14
0:1:5.209 --> 0:1:6.746
For JB.

15
0:1:9.047 --> 0:1:10.617
And for Merlin.

16
0:1:12.184 --> 0:1:13.886
Good night, bruv.

17
0:1:13.919 --> 0:1:15.755
(NECK SNAPS)
(PANTING)

18
0:1:40.311 --> 0:1:42.481
Hey, fellas.

19
0:1:42.515 --> 0:1:44.083
You're going to
give us the code.

20
0:1:44.115 --> 0:1:46.017
(GASPS) Mmm.

21
0:1:46.051 --> 0:1:47.320
Or what?

22
0:1:47.354 --> 0:1:49.556
'Cause you don't seem like
the kind of gentleman

23
0:1:49.588 --> 0:1:52.091
who would hurt a lady.

24
0:1:54.926 --> 0:1:57.729
Perhaps not.
Call me old-fashioned...

25
0:1:57.762 --> 0:2:0.164
I don't consider genocide
especially ladylike.

26
0:2:0.199 --> 0:2:2.936
Right. Enough small talk.

27
0:2:5.203 --> 0:2:6.304
Give us the code.

28
0:2:6.338 --> 0:2:7.606
Sure.

29
0:2:7.640 --> 0:2:9.943
No. I don't think so.

30
0:2:10.709 --> 0:2:11.744
Ooh!

31
0:2:14.146 --> 0:2:15.414
Ow!

32
0:2:19.984 --> 0:2:21.586
Heroin.

33
0:2:21.619 --> 0:2:22.988
You know, where I come from...

34
0:2:23.021 --> 0:2:25.091
this shit you've been peddling's
ruined a lot of lives.

35
0:2:26.257 --> 0:2:28.394
But yours is even more deadly.

36
0:2:28.426 --> 0:2:30.496
But it feels so nice,
it's gonna make you

37
0:2:30.529 --> 0:2:32.331
lower your guard.
Mmm.

38
0:2:32.364 --> 0:2:35.868
Our colleague, Merlin,
may he rest in peace...

39
0:2:35.900 --> 0:2:38.403
managed to synthesize your
horrible little formula...

40
0:2:38.438 --> 0:2:39.739
and speed up its effects.

41
0:2:39.773 --> 0:2:42.775
So I would say you have
just under eight minutes...

42
0:2:42.809 --> 0:2:45.611
before paralysis sets in
and your breathing stops.

43
0:2:45.645 --> 0:2:48.347
But, of course,
you know all about that.

44
0:2:48.381 --> 0:2:51.383
So here's the deal.
You release the antidote worldwide,

45
0:2:51.417 --> 0:2:53.218
and we make sure you get a dose.

46
0:2:53.252 --> 0:2:55.353
I have to give you
the code to live?

47
0:2:55.387 --> 0:2:58.624
Honey, you're so smart.
You should work for me.

48
0:2:58.658 --> 0:3:1.227
Right. Give us the code.
