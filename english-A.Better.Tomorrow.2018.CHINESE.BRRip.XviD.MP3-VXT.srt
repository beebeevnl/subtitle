1
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:19,083
The suspect opened fire.

2
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:21,083
I'm shot, but it's not serious.

3
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:26,292
The balcony door is open, inspector. He may run.

4
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,250
What do we do?

5
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:28,542
Go down and provide backup.

6
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,167
Freeze, police!

7
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,083
Stop!

8
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,292
Get down here!

9
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,500
Get back here.

10
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,292
Don't move! No funny business!

11
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:10,583
Little one. Avoiding my calls?

12
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:12,542
What's going on, Kai?

13
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,208
What else is there?

14
00:03:14,292 --> 00:03:16,250
It's my handsome brother's birthday!

15
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:17,667
Happy birthday!

16
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:20,708
What are you doing?

17
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:24,875
What's with the attitude?

18
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:30,625
Forget it. Forget it.

19
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,333
Today's my first operation.

20
00:03:40,417 --> 00:03:42,375
You've really picked the perfect time to call.

21
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:44,708
A real cop now, aren't ya?

22
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,917
You've taken the game quite seriously now.

23
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:50,542
That was when we were kids. This is for real.

24
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:58,500
It's been ages since I've been home.
How's the old man?

25
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,458
Talking about you every day.

26
00:03:59,542 --> 00:04:00,500
Walk!

27
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,292
I gotta go. We'll talk later.

28
00:04:12,792 --> 00:04:13,750
Who is it?

29
00:04:14,292 --> 00:04:15,583
My buddy from Taiwan.

30
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:17,125
He's doing pretty well out here.

31
00:04:18,667 --> 00:04:19,667
That's good!

32
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,292
What's wrong?

33
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,292
Isn't your brother a cop now?

34
00:04:23,417 --> 00:04:25,125
That's good for us.

35
00:04:33,667 --> 00:04:34,958
Fight on!

36
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,500
Earthquake!

37
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:44,125
An earthquake!

38
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:59,083
"L say, it's better to spend life on the sea"

39
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,625
you're always off-key.

40
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,333
"A better tomorrow 2018"

41
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:11,292
my boss is moving drugs.
My boss also fired that shot.

42
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:12,792
Hurry up-

43
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,042
I hear someone's been holding a shipment.

44
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,125
Transporting by sea

45
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:18,333
where is he going?

46
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,208
Japan.

47
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,417
Mr. okamura.

48
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,750
I'm sorry, we've come too early.

49
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,250
This is the Mr. okamura I've been
telling you about. Very powerful man.

50
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:51,500
He sets off an earthquake when he's angry.

51
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,583
Japan's an active earthquake zone anyway.

52
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:55,417
Because he's always angry.

53
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:57,667
Bullshit.

54
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,292
What a goddamn poser.

55
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,125
We can be posers, too.

56
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:20,000
You're expert smugglers,

57
00:06:21,792 --> 00:06:24,042
but I'm not interested in that.

58
00:06:30,917 --> 00:06:33,792
There's a great demand for synthetic drugs here,

59
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,667
and the risk is just as great.

60
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,333
We all love a good adventure.

61
00:06:38,417 --> 00:06:40,750
So you want us to move cocaine.

62
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:42,667
Thanks,

63
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,875
but no thanks.

64
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:46,542
What was that?

65
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,083
What the hell was that?

66
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:49,042
Rubberband,

67
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,708
what the hell were you thinking,

68
00:06:50,792 --> 00:06:52,000
introducing me to a client like this?

69
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,292
You...

70
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:56,875
Who can make the call?

71
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,542
Actually...

72
00:06:58,625 --> 00:06:59,667
Excuse me.

73
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,250
Kai.

74
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:10,125
You people don't know what you're doing!

75
00:07:16,042 --> 00:07:18,667
Actually, we know exactly what we're doing.

76
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:25,792
Turning down a chance to work with me...

77
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:32,083
You must be blind!

78
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,167
You want to poke my eye out?

79
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:12,375
I won't blink.

80
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:33,167
You sure have an interesting way
of doing things here.

81
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,292
I don't feel the earth shaking.

82
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:15,750
"Move a tad to the right. Back to the left."

83
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:22,000
I thought I told you to stop singing.

84
00:09:22,417 --> 00:09:23,417
Kai,

85
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,667
you have the right to stop listening,

86
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,167
but you can't take away my right to sing.

87
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,125
I'll kick your ass.

88
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:31,958
The cantonese version is even better. Teach me.

89
00:09:32,042 --> 00:09:33,125
Later.

90
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,042
If that jap really did

91
00:09:36,167 --> 00:09:38,417
try to stick a toothpick into your eye,
would you be scared?

92
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,125
Of course I would, but I can't be intimidated.

93
00:09:41,417 --> 00:09:43,083
You get scared, too.

94
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:44,667
Settle down.

95
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,583
Kai,

96
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:50,625
nice weather today! It's so peaceful.

97
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm counting on you, as always,

98
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:53,583
boss.

99
00:09:53,667 --> 00:09:55,542
You're the boss. So generous.

100
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:58,167
It's nothing. Good fortune for all.

101
00:09:59,917 --> 00:10:01,375
Had many girls this time?

102
00:10:03,667 --> 00:10:04,917
I'm not like you.

103
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:07,667
I heard that business is getting tougher

104
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,292
hi.

105
00:10:10,667 --> 00:10:12,417
It's been a long time.

106
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,167
Your poor father,

107
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,542
getting dementia at such a young age.

108
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,125
You two brothers barely spare any time for him.

109
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:40,333
Is it so hard?

110
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:43,625
The cops trained me well, didn't they?

111
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,792
Barely out of the academy and already a workaholic.

112
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:47,750
What will happen when we get married?

113
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:50,083
Don't forget,
there's one more person you have to meet:

114
00:10:50,167 --> 00:10:51,292
My brother.

115
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,500
Your brother is out at sea for a year at a time.

116
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:55,750
He never takes care of you.

117
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,917
Is his opinion that important?

118
00:10:58,917 --> 00:11:00,208
It's very important.

119
00:11:11,542 --> 00:11:15,083
Only on the sea can you appreciate its beauty.

120
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,333
The sea is my world,

121
00:11:17,417 --> 00:11:18,500
my home,

122
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:19,792
my brother,

123
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:20,625
and my father.

124
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:22,708
Don't get all sentimental.

125
00:11:22,792 --> 00:11:24,167
How was that sentimental?

126
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,208
Kai,

127
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:28,042
how does it feel to have a father?

128
00:11:28,917 --> 00:11:30,083
Let me put it this way:

129
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:31,667
A father is like a port.

130
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,708
When you're out at sea, you don't think about it.

131
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,083
But when you have to get off the boat..

132
00:11:36,167 --> 00:11:38,792
Come on, don't be so deep.

133
00:11:38,917 --> 00:11:40,667
You're mocking me because I'm an orphan.

134
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,875
How about this:

135
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:44,625
Having a father is sometimes like having a brother.

136
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,125
Do you get it now?

137
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,042
Kai.

138
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,375
Why don't we...

139
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,750
Make a blood oath and become brothers?

140
00:11:53,292 --> 00:11:55,625
Formalities are meaningless.

141
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:57,458
We're already brothers, aren't we?

142
00:11:57,542 --> 00:11:58,458
No, you don't get it.

143
00:11:58,542 --> 00:12:01,000
When I was a punk in Taiwan...

144
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,292
No matter how much the world changes,

145
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,625
brotherhood never changes.

146
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:08,125
Kai.

147
00:12:10,292 --> 00:12:12,917
Kai. Can we talk somewhere?

148
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:16,083
We can talk here. We're among friends.

149
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,333
As ha said before,

150
00:12:19,417 --> 00:12:22,458
we can't spend the rest of our lives at sea.

151
00:12:22,917 --> 00:12:26,833
Exactly. Then we can all go legit.

152
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,958
That's not what I mean.

153
00:12:29,042 --> 00:12:32,375
The japs are giving us a great opportunity here.

154
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,625
We're not discussing that.

155
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:38,333
You can't even show me a bit of respect?!

156
00:12:38,417 --> 00:12:40,750
Why the hell do you deserve my respect?!

157
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:47,833
What the hell?

158
00:12:48,042 --> 00:12:49,583
What the hell?!

159
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,083
You wanna play rough?

160
00:12:52,167 --> 00:12:53,458
Takeit

161
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:56,792
you goddamn wimp,

162
00:12:58,167 --> 00:13:00,792
you don't have the balls to shoot.

163
00:13:00,917 --> 00:13:02,708
You Taiwan punk.

164
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:08,500
Kai,

165
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:09,792
someone from home's here.

166
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:10,417
Got it.

167
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,583
Shall we bring out the food?

168
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:12,583
Go ahead.

169
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,083
Changing course

170
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:20,708
slow it down.

171
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,458
I really want to be on the front line with them.

172
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:50,417
Careful

173
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:04,625
catch this.

174
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,208
See ya.

175
00:14:10,542 --> 00:14:11,583
Take care.

176
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,083
When I was a kid,
i would wait for my brother by the shore.

177
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,208
Keep going.

178
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,792
My brother began working on boats

179
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,375
before he'd even finished high school.

180
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:34,417
Sometimes he'd be gone for a year.

181
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,000
But when he comes home,

182
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,333
he'd always brought me good food

183
00:14:38,417 --> 00:14:39,958
and fun toys.

184
00:14:40,042 --> 00:14:41,667
He'd tell me amazing stories, too.

185
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,333
Sounds like you really idolize your brother.

186
00:14:43,417 --> 00:14:46,625
We used to play cops and robbers
when we were kids.

187
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:48,542
But I could never beat him.

188
00:14:48,917 --> 00:14:51,542
Then your brother must be a natural criminal.

189
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:12,792
Kai.

190
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,375
This is the Chinese coast guard.

191
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,250
Stop your engine and prepare for inspection.

192
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:21,333
That's them.

193
00:15:21,417 --> 00:15:23,667
This is the Chinese coast guard.

194
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,792
Stop your engine and prepare for inspection.

195
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:36,500
They remodeled their ship.

196
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:37,542
We can't catch up!

197
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:38,750
Push the engines.

198
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,833
We've raided these smugglers a few times.

199
00:15:45,917 --> 00:15:47,500
Have they ever been caught with narcotics?

200
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:48,208
No, sir.

201
00:15:48,292 --> 00:15:48,958
Hands on your head.

202
00:15:49,042 --> 00:15:50,458
Don't move. Behave yourselves.

203
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,417
Fire a warning shot.

204
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:20,583
What is he doing?

205
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,208
That's enough. Let them go.

206
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:38,833
Understood.

207
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,125
We've lost them.

208
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,500
Let's go.

209
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:49,958
Welcome back, Kai.

210
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:51,708
Brought back something nice?

211
00:16:51,792 --> 00:16:52,958
Thanks, Kai!

212
00:16:53,042 --> 00:16:54,333
You must've had some fun, Kai.

213
00:16:54,417 --> 00:16:55,875
Mei-lin must be eager to see you.

214
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:56,958
<i>Piss off!</i>

215
00:16:58,667 --> 00:16:59,625
Good work.

216
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:12,875
"L say, it's better to spend life on the sea"

217
00:17:13,417 --> 00:17:17,500
"i can't look back in fear of confusion"

218
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:24,417
"there's someone that loves you,
but you love someone else"

219
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:28,542
see you tomorrow.

220
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,333
I'm going to see ha first.

221
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:31,542
Don't drink too much.

222
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:32,875
You, too.

223
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:02,417
Mark.

224
00:18:02,667 --> 00:18:05,083
Mark. It's been forever.

225
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,167
Miss me?

226
00:18:50,167 --> 00:18:51,125
Police, freeze!

227
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,208
Let go.

228
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:07,917
Can you stop toying with me?

229
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,542
- Can you behave properly?
- Cut the bullshit.

230
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,958
You punk.

231
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,708
Think you're something now?

232
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:20,333
What? You always nabbed me when we were kids.

233
00:19:20,417 --> 00:19:22,167
Why can't I nab you just once?

234
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,250
Catch me? It ain't that easy.

235
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:26,417
Is dad home?

236
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,458
He's in the hospital.

237
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:29,208
I came home to pick up some things.

238
00:19:29,292 --> 00:19:29,750
What's wrong with him?

239
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:31,917
His dementia's acting up again.

240
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,542
Take me to the hospital.

241
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:35,500
Kai.

242
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:36,875
I have something to tell you.

243
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,083
I already know.

244
00:19:38,167 --> 00:19:41,708
I got a present for your girlfriend. How is it?

245
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,208
When did you become so awfully nice?

246
00:19:44,292 --> 00:19:45,792
You rascal.

247
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,667
It's about time I meet her.

248
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,625
Of course.

249
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,583
I want to know what you think of her.

250
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,250
Alright. Come down.

251
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:55,333
Practically a grown man

252
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,958
it's the boat's problem, not mine.

253
00:20:03,042 --> 00:20:04,792
You know I've got skills behind the wheel.

254
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:05,542
Ha.

255
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:06,833
- Shut up.
- I'm awesomely skillful.

256
00:20:06,917 --> 00:20:08,792
I've been in this game way before you have pubes.

257
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,083
Go play with the girls.

258
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:21,708
"Fate will decide whether you'll be rich or poor"

259
00:20:21,792 --> 00:20:23,917
"it never seems right..."

260
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:32,417
"It's my pleasure to have you by my side"

261
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:38,417
"I'll smile as I depart with no regrets"

262
00:20:39,042 --> 00:20:44,375
"i say, it's better to spend life on the sea"

263
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:49,750
"i can't look back in fear of confusion"

264
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,792
there's nothing wrong with me.

265
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,792
There aren't enough beds here.
I don't want to trouble them.

266
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:55,625
I should leave now.

267
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:56,417
No.

268
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,417
The doctor said you can go home tomorrow.

269
00:20:58,542 --> 00:20:59,417
Be good.

270
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,417
We'll do whatever you want tomorrow.

271
00:21:03,417 --> 00:21:04,333
Doc.

272
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,875
When I leave tomorrow,

273
00:21:07,542 --> 00:21:09,500
will my son come pick me up?

274
00:21:14,292 --> 00:21:16,292
Which son are you talking about?

275
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,458
I have two sons.

276
00:21:19,542 --> 00:21:22,083
One is a sailor, and the other is a cop.

277
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:26,333
I hear the sailor was a real pain to deal with.

278
00:21:26,417 --> 00:21:28,042
Such a pain.

279
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:31,542
I didn't hesitate to beat some sense into him,

280
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:33,958
so he ran off early.

281
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,292
The one who became a cop...

282
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:41,167
He must've been well-behaved.

283
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,292
I drove his brother away,

284
00:21:45,167 --> 00:21:47,583
so he had a tough time growing up.

285
00:21:47,792 --> 00:21:49,917
Those damn bullies.

286
00:21:52,042 --> 00:21:53,292
Never mind.

287
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:57,625
Actually,

288
00:21:59,917 --> 00:22:02,167
I've always wanted to

289
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,042
apologize to them.

290
00:22:05,167 --> 00:22:06,750
Apologize to them.

291
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,000
You know.

292
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,125
By the way.

293
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:19,083
I got you some health food from abroad.

294
00:22:19,167 --> 00:22:22,708
They're good for you. Remember to eat them.

295
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,500
You shouldn't have. This is too much.

296
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:26,625
It's not much.

297
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:27,958
What is this?

298
00:22:30,667 --> 00:22:33,708
What's wrong with you? He cannot eat this stuff.

299
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:35,417
Who asked you to bring these?

300
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,000
I've written down the things he can eat.

301
00:22:38,917 --> 00:22:40,208
Just follow the list.

302
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:42,750
This room is for family only.

303
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,208
Chao. Come over here.

304
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,000
Your friend is going to get your dad hurt.

305
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:51,583
I don't think he's trustworthy.

306
00:22:51,667 --> 00:22:53,083
But he thinks you're trustworthy.

307
00:22:53,167 --> 00:22:54,417
I don't want to talk to you.

308
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,667
That man is my brother.

309
00:22:59,792 --> 00:23:01,583
Today's top story:

310
00:23:01,667 --> 00:23:04,292
A joint raid by customs and the police

311
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:05,958
uncovered a shipment of smuggled goods.

312
00:23:06,042 --> 00:23:07,167
Two suspects

313
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,958
fled the scene during the raid.

314
00:23:09,042 --> 00:23:09,625
Now

315
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:10,625
the police are...

316
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:15,042
And then?

317
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,750
I've never seen these two.
Perhaps they don't belong to the same gang.

318
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:19,833
Inspector guo.

319
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:23,208
Superintendent song. The meeting's over?

320
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:24,542
How's your injury?

321
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:25,250
I'm fine.

322
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:26,625
An)' Progress?

323
00:23:26,708 --> 00:23:28,458
No one's seen these guys before.

324
00:23:28,542 --> 00:23:30,250
I'll keep looking into it.

325
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:35,042
My guess is... this is a team of smugglers
changing careers.

326
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:36,083
I'll send you a few more guys.

327
00:23:36,167 --> 00:23:36,667
Sure.

328
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:37,500
Hang in there.

329
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:38,417
I'll be fine.

330
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:45,042
Hey, handsome.

331
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:47,167
Making repairs this time of night?

332
00:23:49,417 --> 00:23:50,542
Hey, gorgeous.

333
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:53,000
Anything need fixing?

334
00:23:53,167 --> 00:23:55,750
That ship's been ashore for a year.

335
00:23:56,167 --> 00:23:57,917
It's probably broken already.

336
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:00,500
Let's give it a try.

337
00:24:03,167 --> 00:24:06,125
All these years...
You're still dragging your feet.

338
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,042
And I've been at your Beck and call.

339
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:10,250
Where is your conscience?

340
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:14,083
Client

341
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:19,250
do you know what I hate the most?

342
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:20,292
I do.

343
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,000
Being lied to.

344
00:24:22,958 --> 00:24:24,458
I never lied to you.

345
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,042
Are you my boyfriend or something?

346
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:29,500
You don't own me.

347
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:42,625
Enough already.

348
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:46,625
How long are you staying this time?

349
00:24:46,708 --> 00:24:47,958
Ask my big brother.

350
00:24:48,042 --> 00:24:49,167
Your big brother?

351
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,125
You mean Kai.

352
00:24:51,333 --> 00:24:53,042
You'll do whatever Kai asks?

353
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:54,125
Of course.

354
00:24:54,417 --> 00:24:56,750
And if Kai asks you to croak?

355
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,333
Then I'll croak.

356
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,583
I'm sorry, ha.

357
00:25:19,667 --> 00:25:20,333
Sorry for being late.

358
00:25:20,417 --> 00:25:21,000
This is...

359
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:22,458
This is my godson.

360
00:25:22,542 --> 00:25:23,417
Kai.

361
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,417
Take a seat.

362
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:29,292
Your boy doesn't need a seat, right?

363
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:33,167
He's not my boy.

364
00:25:33,375 --> 00:25:34,417
He's my brother.

365
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:36,875
Everyone here is my brother.

366
00:25:36,958 --> 00:25:38,292
Sit down, everyone.

367
00:25:39,708 --> 00:25:41,375
Looks like we're all here.

368
00:25:41,917 --> 00:25:43,125
Hi, ha.

369
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:45,208
This is Kai's...

370
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,583
Hello, Mei-lin.

371
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,375
What's your name?

372
00:25:48,458 --> 00:25:49,750
This must be your first time.

373
00:25:49,833 --> 00:25:50,708
<i>Just ca“ me gang.</i>

374
00:25:50,792 --> 00:25:52,083
Don't be a stranger, ok?

375
00:25:54,417 --> 00:25:56,208
Looking sexy tonight, rubberband.

376
00:25:56,292 --> 00:25:58,417
You've got a good eye.

377
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:01,167
Wore yourself out last night, mark?

378
00:26:02,417 --> 00:26:03,500
Thanks, Mei-lin.

379
00:26:03,875 --> 00:26:06,583
Kai, no alcohol for you tonight.

380
00:26:06,667 --> 00:26:07,792
Have some tea.

381
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:17,250
I have something to attend to.

382
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:19,083
You'll have to excuse me.

383
00:26:19,167 --> 00:26:20,000
Uncle, why don't I...

384
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:22,625
Listen, Kai,

385
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:25,000
cang just came here from the countryside.

386
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,292
You've got plenty to learn from Kai.

387
00:26:27,375 --> 00:26:28,583
Don't learn from me

388
00:26:28,667 --> 00:26:30,958
I'm getting behind on the times.

389
00:26:31,417 --> 00:26:34,625
Things are changing too quickly these days.

390
00:26:34,708 --> 00:26:35,750
Come on.

391
00:26:35,833 --> 00:26:36,875
Thanks for your hard work, guys.

392
00:26:36,958 --> 00:26:39,625
Good thing yesterday was a false alarm.

393
00:26:39,708 --> 00:26:42,500
Watch your back more carefully from now on.

394
00:26:42,583 --> 00:26:43,917
Cheers!

395
00:26:46,083 --> 00:26:47,292
Good work!

396
00:26:51,625 --> 00:26:52,667
Ha.

397
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,417
The world's changing.

398
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,875
Smugglers like us

399
00:26:58,167 --> 00:27:00,875
are no better than those overseas shoppers.

400
00:27:00,958 --> 00:27:03,917
And we risk our lives at sea.
The work isn't worth the pay.

401
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,625
Are you scared?

402
00:27:09,542 --> 00:27:12,042
Just say what you want to say.

403
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:14,250
I'm making myself clear already.

404
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:16,458
I want to move something else.

405
00:27:16,542 --> 00:27:17,542
Like what?

406
00:27:17,625 --> 00:27:20,458
If we're going to keep moving cargo by boat,

407
00:27:20,542 --> 00:27:24,083
we should move whatever brings in the most cash.

408
00:27:26,208 --> 00:27:27,792
We've established a pretty clear set of rules,

409
00:27:27,875 --> 00:27:29,000
haven't we, ha?

410
00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:32,667
No drugs and no waste.

411
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:33,917
We're just looking to make a few bucks.

412
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,125
We're not to inflict harm upon anyone.

413
00:27:37,042 --> 00:27:38,583
You're a noble one.

414
00:27:38,667 --> 00:27:39,917
These are the rules.

415
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,750
Rules aren't sacred.

416
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:42,500
What are you doing?

417
00:27:42,583 --> 00:27:43,375
What is this?

418
00:27:43,458 --> 00:27:44,750
What is this?

419
00:27:45,667 --> 00:27:48,208
That's enough. Talk it out.

420
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:49,167
Ha,

421
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,417
are we running two boats or one?

422
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,042
You tell me.

423
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,458
Of course we're on the same boat.

424
00:27:57,083 --> 00:28:00,250
But as ha said,

425
00:28:00,333 --> 00:28:01,875
everyone knows that Kai

426
00:28:01,958 --> 00:28:04,417
has made a fortune

427
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,167
running the Japan route.

428
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,292
You alone hold the contact list

429
00:28:09,375 --> 00:28:12,667
of our clients in Japan.

430
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,250
Why don't you take it out?

431
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:17,125
Share the wealth.

432
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:20,292
So we can get rich together.

433
00:28:23,417 --> 00:28:24,542
There's no point

434
00:28:24,792 --> 00:28:26,292
in forcing anyone's hand.

435
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:39,333
What you want is in here.

436
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,792
Sure,

437
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:43,875
you can use it to make some extra cash.

438
00:28:43,958 --> 00:28:45,292
But I have one condition.

439
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:47,625
Stay away from drugs, we stay on the boat.

440
00:28:47,708 --> 00:28:50,125
If not, I'm getting off.

441
00:28:56,792 --> 00:28:59,250
I, ha, care a great deal about loyalty.

442
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:10,000
Who do you think you are?

443
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:11,500
If he didn't have your back,

444
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,750
I'd kill you today.

445
00:29:12,833 --> 00:29:13,583
I can kill you right now.

446
00:29:13,667 --> 00:29:14,958
Bring it on.

447
00:29:16,042 --> 00:29:17,000
You,

448
00:29:17,208 --> 00:29:18,292
get out.

449
00:29:24,208 --> 00:29:25,792
Did you forget that I'm right here?

450
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:30,542
Am I dead to you?

451
00:29:43,583 --> 00:29:44,500
By the way.

452
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:47,375
I have a deal going down tonight.

453
00:29:47,458 --> 00:29:48,875
I need you to take care of it.

454
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:50,625
What kind of deal?

455
00:29:50,708 --> 00:29:51,458
Oh.

456
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,833
Those japs do everything by the book.

457
00:29:56,917 --> 00:29:58,583
Do it for me.

458
00:30:00,208 --> 00:30:01,083
Sure.

459
00:30:01,375 --> 00:30:03,625
Consider it a last favor.

460
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:19,625
Stay out of the exchange tonight.

461
00:30:19,708 --> 00:30:20,792
Sure.

462
00:30:21,125 --> 00:30:22,875
You must be joking.

463
00:30:22,958 --> 00:30:25,333
You've never kept me away from a deal before.

464
00:30:25,417 --> 00:30:25,875
Unless...

465
00:30:25,958 --> 00:30:27,083
Just stay away.

466
00:30:27,583 --> 00:30:29,125
It'll be a simple exchange.

467
00:30:29,208 --> 00:30:30,042
I still want to be there.

468
00:30:30,125 --> 00:30:31,458
Are you gonna listen to me or not?

469
00:30:32,125 --> 00:30:33,250
What's wrong?

470
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:34,917
This is a copy.

471
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:38,417
Never settle in one place. I'll just lose it.

472
00:30:38,708 --> 00:30:40,667
Then give it to Mei-lin.

473
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:44,458
All women change,

474
00:30:44,917 --> 00:30:46,667
except for yours.

475
00:30:47,458 --> 00:30:48,500
He's not answering.

476
00:30:56,458 --> 00:30:58,708
- Don't worry, inspector guo.
- We're going into overtime.

477
00:30:59,583 --> 00:31:00,375
Gear up.

478
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:01,792
There's something I have to do tonight.

479
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:03,667
I can't pick up dad from the hospital.

480
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:06,292
I already brought him home.

481
00:31:06,375 --> 00:31:08,292
Everything is alright now. He wants to see you.

482
00:31:08,375 --> 00:31:09,958
I'll be home tomorrow.

483
00:31:10,042 --> 00:31:12,583
By the way, your girlfriend's a nice girl.

484
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,875
Alright.

485
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,500
Table for four under zhou.

486
00:31:17,583 --> 00:31:19,333
Two guests are here already.

487
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,375
Let's order

488
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:37,875
ls it too bright in here?

489
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:45,083
Those two japs look ice cold.

490
00:31:46,208 --> 00:31:47,458
Pair of posers.

491
00:31:59,625 --> 00:32:00,208
Mark.

492
00:32:00,292 --> 00:32:01,458
Long time no see.

493
00:32:01,542 --> 00:32:03,083
- Hey, boss.
- You're back.

494
00:32:03,167 --> 00:32:04,167
Same old, same old.

495
00:32:05,667 --> 00:32:06,792
Say, handsome,

496
00:32:07,667 --> 00:32:10,042
you are not eating. What's with the toothpick?

497
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,375
Here you go.

498
00:32:24,958 --> 00:32:25,708
Bill, please.

499
00:32:25,792 --> 00:32:27,583
No worries, I'll keep it on your tab.

500
00:32:27,667 --> 00:32:28,750
Thanks.

501
00:32:29,625 --> 00:32:30,667
What is it?

502
00:32:32,667 --> 00:32:35,667
Let's go somewhere else. We can't talk here.

503
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:38,125
We're here to talk business, not flirt.

504
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:41,333
I hope you'll respect our wishes.

505
00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:49,833
What about cargo

506
00:32:50,083 --> 00:32:51,583
that you've brought this time...

507
00:32:52,708 --> 00:32:54,167
You can see it later.

508
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,875
I want to see it now.

509
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,042
<i>L.</i>

510
00:32:58,125 --> 00:32:59,542
Go to the bathroom.

511
00:33:05,125 --> 00:33:06,125
Kai,

512
00:33:06,625 --> 00:33:07,458
my buddy told me that

513
00:33:07,542 --> 00:33:09,375
rubberband already checked the cargo
with the Japanese.

514
00:33:09,458 --> 00:33:11,500
He's already on the boat, on his way to Japan.

515
00:33:11,583 --> 00:33:13,250
Those two guys are shady.

516
00:33:13,333 --> 00:33:14,667
Watch your back.

517
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:21,875
I'll on my way.

518
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,208
I'm fine.

519
00:33:28,833 --> 00:33:30,792
Wait, I need to use the bathroom.

520
00:33:31,458 --> 00:33:32,500
Then“.

521
00:33:35,125 --> 00:33:36,667
Let's go together.

522
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:38,750
Shall we?

523
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:03,208
Out of the way!

524
00:34:03,292 --> 00:34:04,292
Go after him.

525
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:46,042
Push it open!

526
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:50,500
I can't open it!

527
00:34:50,583 --> 00:34:51,792
Get down

528
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:55,375
hurry up-

529
00:34:58,708 --> 00:35:00,167
police, freeze!

530
00:35:02,417 --> 00:35:03,542
Come out.

531
00:35:07,083 --> 00:35:07,625
Come out right now!

532
00:35:07,708 --> 00:35:08,417
Run!

533
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,375
Freeze!

534
00:35:09,542 --> 00:35:10,500
Or I'll fire!

535
00:35:14,875 --> 00:35:15,833
Over here.

536
00:35:19,125 --> 00:35:20,000
Kai.

537
00:35:21,042 --> 00:35:21,958
Don't move.

538
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:38,708
Kai, let's just hide here.

539
00:35:38,792 --> 00:35:40,417
That way's a dead end.

540
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,292
He'll make his way back here for sure.

541
00:35:49,792 --> 00:35:51,000
You go that way.

542
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:52,417
I'll go this way.

543
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,500
No way. You're hurt.

544
00:35:54,583 --> 00:35:56,458
Go! Right now!

545
00:35:56,875 --> 00:35:58,000
I'm sorry.

546
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:18,000
They're going down tunnel four.

547
00:36:23,958 --> 00:36:25,875
Rubberband set us up.

548
00:36:26,375 --> 00:36:27,583
Stop the car.

549
00:36:30,292 --> 00:36:31,333
Where are you?

550
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,417
Stay out of sight.

551
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,167
You better leave town.

552
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:35,083
Stop! You,

553
00:36:35,708 --> 00:36:36,958
toss away the object in your hand.

554
00:36:37,042 --> 00:36:38,042
Put your hands up.

555
00:36:41,583 --> 00:36:42,750
Put your hands up.

556
00:36:48,417 --> 00:36:49,875
Run if you can, Kai.

557
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:51,958
I won't get away.

558
00:36:52,042 --> 00:36:53,417
Put both your hands up!

559
00:36:55,417 --> 00:36:56,333
Bro,

560
00:36:57,167 --> 00:36:59,625
looks like we won't see each other for a while.

561
00:36:59,708 --> 00:37:00,875
I say again,

562
00:37:00,958 --> 00:37:02,417
put both your hands up!

563
00:37:03,792 --> 00:37:05,292
Take care of yourself.

564
00:37:21,083 --> 00:37:23,167
Keep going or what, man?

565
00:38:47,292 --> 00:38:49,292
Do you hear me? I'm talking to you.

566
00:38:49,625 --> 00:38:52,917
Buddy, are you sure
you want to take the fall for this?

567
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:56,792
Who's the other person in the sewer?

568
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:01,333
He must have a backup copy.

569
00:39:02,417 --> 00:39:03,667
Search again.

570
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:11,375
I only know that he lives here.

571
00:39:11,458 --> 00:39:13,917
I don't know anything else.

572
00:39:14,792 --> 00:39:16,708
You guys carry on.

573
00:39:17,083 --> 00:39:18,958
I, ha, care a great deal about loyalty.

574
00:39:19,542 --> 00:39:20,667
Thanks, ha.

575
00:39:22,875 --> 00:39:24,083
What are you doing?

576
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,542
Just getting a shot, Mei-lin.

577
00:39:27,625 --> 00:39:29,125
What are you guys doing?

578
00:39:29,208 --> 00:39:31,083
Mei-lin.

579
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:32,875
Shut up.

580
00:39:34,917 --> 00:39:36,417
I understand, inspector Cheng.

581
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:38,792
Lam going home.

582
00:40:05,125 --> 00:40:06,792
You thieve!

583
00:40:07,583 --> 00:40:09,125
I'll kill you!

584
00:40:15,083 --> 00:40:17,333
Someone help! Thieve!

585
00:40:22,958 --> 00:40:24,250
Stop screaming!

586
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:28,625
Dad!

587
00:41:20,583 --> 00:41:22,875
Dad!

588
00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:25,333
Dad!

589
00:44:02,208 --> 00:44:03,958
Thank you.

590
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:24,417
Who are you?

591
00:44:43,167 --> 00:44:44,458
What do you want?

592
00:44:44,542 --> 00:44:46,125
It's none of your business.

593
00:47:40,083 --> 00:47:40,958
Another one.

594
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:00,500
I hear a friend of yours got crippled

595
00:48:00,583 --> 00:48:02,208
while avenging you.

596
00:48:02,292 --> 00:48:03,625
This really happened?

597
00:48:04,667 --> 00:48:06,667
No talking, 8015.

598
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:23,625
Few more bottles.

599
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:26,625
Put it on his tab.

600
00:48:27,833 --> 00:48:29,250
It's chao.

601
00:48:29,792 --> 00:48:31,417
I know. Officer.

602
00:48:32,958 --> 00:48:34,083
What do you want?

603
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:36,083
Thanks.

604
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:40,583
What happened in the bar in Japan...

605
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:41,833
That was you, wasn't it?

606
00:48:46,542 --> 00:48:49,333
I hear that the shooter
only shot the jap in the legs.

607
00:48:49,417 --> 00:48:50,958
That's why he was let go.

608
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:52,333
Don't worry.

609
00:48:53,458 --> 00:48:55,000
Your brother didn't say anything.

610
00:48:59,417 --> 00:49:00,750
He's your brother, too.

611
00:49:07,083 --> 00:49:09,042
Why don't you leave this city?

612
00:49:09,667 --> 00:49:11,083
Why should I leave?

613
00:49:11,917 --> 00:49:13,958
I just want you to stay out of trouble.

614
00:49:18,375 --> 00:49:19,958
Nervous about something?

615
00:49:24,708 --> 00:49:26,875
It's for your own good. And my brother's, too.

616
00:49:39,708 --> 00:49:40,792
Again.

617
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,542
Police!

618
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:56,542
Get out of the car.

619
00:49:56,792 --> 00:49:57,333
Police!

620
00:49:57,417 --> 00:49:58,333
Don't move!

621
00:50:00,875 --> 00:50:02,208
During yesterday's raid,

622
00:50:02,292 --> 00:50:05,208
the police apprehended three suspects.

623
00:50:05,292 --> 00:50:06,625
Here's a report from the scene.

624
00:50:06,708 --> 00:50:08,500
What the hell is this?

625
00:50:08,583 --> 00:50:10,000
I'm talking to you.

626
00:50:12,833 --> 00:50:13,917
Stop running.

627
00:50:17,458 --> 00:50:18,458
Got you.

628
00:50:32,958 --> 00:50:34,958
A special gift.

629
00:50:36,958 --> 00:50:38,042
Promise me.

630
00:50:38,042 --> 00:50:39,250
Don't break it again.

631
00:50:39,458 --> 00:50:45,250
No matter what you say, I stay true to myself

632
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:50,792
in the end, I believe that silence is golden

633
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:57,125
I hear you kept your mouth closed.

634
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,542
You must think you're real righteous.

635
00:51:01,958 --> 00:51:03,625
I used to have a friend

636
00:51:03,708 --> 00:51:05,208
that was just like you.

637
00:51:06,625 --> 00:51:08,083
In the end,

638
00:51:11,958 --> 00:51:14,292
before he met his maker,

639
00:51:15,542 --> 00:51:16,417
he told me that

640
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:20,375
those who have the guts to repent

641
00:51:21,667 --> 00:51:23,333
are the real heroes.

642
00:51:28,208 --> 00:51:30,000
Everything in this world is cyclical.

643
00:51:31,083 --> 00:51:33,333
We go through a cycle every few decades.

644
00:51:59,708 --> 00:52:01,167
Where are you going, pal?

645
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:02,917
You need a car, buddy?

646
00:52:03,833 --> 00:52:05,917
Public transport will take forever.

647
00:52:26,833 --> 00:52:28,500
Where are we going?

648
00:52:30,375 --> 00:52:31,500
Train station.

649
00:52:31,708 --> 00:52:32,750
What for?

650
00:52:32,833 --> 00:52:34,792
You need to leave this city.

651
00:52:38,167 --> 00:52:39,750
Where is dad's grave?

652
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,083
I want to pay my respects.

653
00:52:52,833 --> 00:52:53,958
Get out.

654
00:53:01,208 --> 00:53:03,292
Do you remember what you said before?

655
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:06,000
You said you hate being lied to.

656
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:07,667
Liar...

657
00:53:08,208 --> 00:53:09,375
What did you do to me?

658
00:53:09,458 --> 00:53:11,083
What did you do to dad?

659
00:53:11,167 --> 00:53:13,083
You got dad killed.

660
00:53:13,167 --> 00:53:15,250
How dare you show your face to him?

661
00:53:17,042 --> 00:53:18,125
Also,

662
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,500
you used to be preachy as hell.

663
00:53:20,583 --> 00:53:22,833
How did you turn into a mute in prison?

664
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:25,167
You want to protect your buddies?

665
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:26,292
You want to be loyal?

666
00:53:26,375 --> 00:53:29,250
I can tell you're pretty loyal to them.

667
00:53:30,042 --> 00:53:31,000
You fraud.

668
00:53:37,125 --> 00:53:38,292
Listen up,

669
00:53:38,375 --> 00:53:39,833
you better stay away from me.

670
00:53:39,917 --> 00:53:41,708
I never want to see you again.

671
00:53:41,792 --> 00:53:43,042
<i>Piss off!</i>

672
00:54:15,583 --> 00:54:16,917
You're home.

673
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:21,167
I thought you have meetings all day.

674
00:54:25,042 --> 00:54:26,542
What happened to your hand?

675
00:54:32,875 --> 00:54:34,292
Nothing. I was arresting a perp.

676
00:54:34,375 --> 00:54:36,125
Why were you arresting a perp at a meeting?

677
00:54:36,208 --> 00:54:37,833
You're hiding something from me.

678
00:54:50,917 --> 00:54:53,417
How dare you show your face here!

679
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:54,833
How dare you!

680
00:54:58,208 --> 00:54:59,792
I just wanted to see dad.

681
00:55:00,625 --> 00:55:01,583
Stop it, chao.

682
00:55:01,667 --> 00:55:02,542
Chao.

683
00:55:05,083 --> 00:55:06,417
Come in, Kai.

684
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:22,333
Have some water.

685
00:55:23,375 --> 00:55:24,167
Thanks.

686
00:56:04,458 --> 00:56:06,750
Did dad say anything before he died?

687
00:56:12,208 --> 00:56:14,125
If there's ever a rift

688
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:16,292
between you two.

689
00:56:17,333 --> 00:56:19,083
Try your best

690
00:56:20,792 --> 00:56:22,458
to forgive each other.

691
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:24,875
I'm telling you right now,

692
00:56:25,458 --> 00:56:26,708
I'll never forgive you.

693
00:56:26,792 --> 00:56:31,125
Dad.

694
00:56:47,042 --> 00:56:48,250
Listen,

695
00:56:48,333 --> 00:56:50,417
if you go back to your old ways,

696
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:52,292
I'll put you in handcuffs myself.

697
00:57:01,583 --> 00:57:02,958
Forward, my brother!

698
00:57:03,042 --> 00:57:04,750
Turn!

699
00:57:05,417 --> 00:57:07,792
Get down now. I'm tired.

700
00:57:08,375 --> 00:57:09,583
No way!

701
00:57:09,667 --> 00:57:11,292
I want another ride!

702
00:57:13,125 --> 00:57:14,625
Forward!

703
00:57:20,417 --> 00:57:21,500
Kai,

704
00:57:21,708 --> 00:57:24,917
that crippled man fixing boats at the docks
is your best friend, right?

705
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,833
What are you chatting about, 8453?

706
00:57:26,917 --> 00:57:28,125
Nothing, sir.

707
00:57:28,208 --> 00:57:29,750
Go mind your own business.

708
00:57:35,375 --> 00:57:36,917
Is there someone named mark here?

709
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,250
Do you know anyone named mark?

710
00:57:38,333 --> 00:57:39,917
He has a limp.

711
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:40,500
There.

712
00:57:40,583 --> 00:57:41,875
There's the gimp.

713
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:42,500
Gimp!

714
00:57:59,667 --> 00:58:05,000
"No one should be alone forever"

715
00:58:05,583 --> 00:58:10,667
"it's my pleasure to have you by my side"

716
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:16,167
"ln the end, I believe that silence is golden"

717
00:58:33,833 --> 00:58:35,292
still handsome after all these years,

718
00:58:35,417 --> 00:58:37,208
and still singing off-key.

719
00:58:39,833 --> 00:58:40,958
What's wrong?

720
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:43,000
Nothing

721
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:45,125
your leg...

722
00:58:45,208 --> 00:58:46,208
Forget it.

723
00:58:47,333 --> 00:58:49,375
I couldn't get away quick enough.

724
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,792
I'm fine now.

725
00:58:51,875 --> 00:58:53,042
Look,

726
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,375
I can still kick asses

727
00:58:56,792 --> 00:58:58,000
and I can still bend it.

728
00:58:58,292 --> 00:58:59,042
It's fine.

729
00:58:59,125 --> 00:59:00,417
I owe you one.

730
00:59:00,583 --> 00:59:02,083
Don't say that.

731
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:04,333
I'm glad you're back.

732
00:59:05,292 --> 00:59:06,500
I truly am.

733
00:59:06,958 --> 00:59:08,542
We can work together again.

734
00:59:11,333 --> 00:59:12,333
In what?

735
00:59:12,417 --> 00:59:13,958
Our old business.

736
00:59:14,042 --> 00:59:15,125
Let's do it.

737
00:59:18,833 --> 00:59:20,125
I don't want to go back to that.

738
00:59:20,667 --> 00:59:22,542
Let's do something legit.

739
00:59:22,625 --> 00:59:23,750
Something steady.

740
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:26,208
Sure.

741
00:59:32,292 --> 00:59:33,250
Something...

742
00:59:38,625 --> 00:59:40,000
Steady...

743
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:44,667
Are you sure?

744
00:59:46,458 --> 00:59:47,708
Are you afraid?

745
00:59:51,875 --> 00:59:53,083
I suffered for three years.

746
00:59:53,167 --> 00:59:54,042
I pondered for three years.

747
00:59:54,125 --> 00:59:56,292
I waited for you for three years.

748
00:59:57,750 --> 01:00:00,667
Now that you are back, and you want to go legit.

749
01:00:01,667 --> 01:00:03,208
<i>Even gang has made ne. Way to the top.</i>

750
01:00:03,292 --> 01:00:04,333
Did you know that?

751
01:00:04,417 --> 01:00:06,375
Enough said, I get it.

752
01:00:09,208 --> 01:00:11,500
Your little brother is a cop.

753
01:00:11,583 --> 01:00:13,833
He's more important than me, right?

754
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:17,000
You used to listen to me.

755
01:00:17,083 --> 01:00:18,583
You've changed.

756
01:00:19,125 --> 01:00:21,208
"No matter how much the world changes,

757
01:00:21,667 --> 01:00:24,292
brotherhood never changes." That's what you said.

758
01:00:31,792 --> 01:00:33,500
I've repaired your boat.

759
01:00:33,583 --> 01:00:35,125
It's sitting at the west pier.

760
01:00:35,208 --> 01:00:36,917
Mei-lin insists on living there.

761
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,292
Go see her.

762
01:00:38,375 --> 01:00:38,958
She's helpless.

763
01:00:39,042 --> 01:00:40,083
Wait.

764
01:00:42,167 --> 01:00:44,917
There you are, Kai.

765
01:00:45,167 --> 01:00:46,542
It's been a while.

766
01:00:50,125 --> 01:00:51,125
Out of my way.

767
01:00:59,792 --> 01:01:00,750
Mark.

768
01:01:00,833 --> 01:01:01,750
Kai.

769
01:01:03,458 --> 01:01:05,417
- Pick him up.
- Leave me alone.

770
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:06,750
My man is out of line, Kai.

771
01:01:06,833 --> 01:01:10,042
You are messing with my buddy in front of me.
What the hell!

772
01:01:12,958 --> 01:01:16,167
I want to thank you for not snitching
on me years ago.

773
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:18,375
I also want you to know that

774
01:01:18,625 --> 01:01:20,417
there's a spot for you on my team.

775
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:22,417
Brothers should make money together.

776
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:27,625
Let's get drinks some time.

777
01:01:31,208 --> 01:01:33,667
Stand right there. I don't need your help.

778
01:01:34,083 --> 01:01:35,292
Go away!

779
01:01:35,375 --> 01:01:36,458
Go!

780
01:01:36,542 --> 01:01:37,625
Get outta here!

781
01:01:38,667 --> 01:01:40,042
What the hell is this?

782
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Are you even real gangsters?

783
01:02:19,958 --> 01:02:21,583
The repairman's back.

784
01:02:22,625 --> 01:02:24,000
Why don't you fix me?

785
01:02:24,083 --> 01:02:25,167
Fix me.

786
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:30,667
What the hell is this?

787
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:36,167
I'm living here.

788
01:02:37,583 --> 01:02:39,708
I like the smell here.

789
01:02:46,750 --> 01:02:49,042
What are you doing? Do I repel you?

790
01:02:55,458 --> 01:02:56,833
I'm meeting a client.

791
01:02:56,917 --> 01:02:59,458
I'll come see you later.

792
01:03:03,417 --> 01:03:04,708
It's been three years.

793
01:03:07,125 --> 01:03:08,625
What was I supposed to do?

794
01:03:18,542 --> 01:03:21,708
I dare you to hit me!

795
01:03:23,292 --> 01:03:24,292
Never.

796
01:03:55,917 --> 01:03:58,375
Can we start with a clean slate

797
01:03:58,500 --> 01:03:59,417
here,

798
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:01,917
try this.

799
01:04:02,125 --> 01:04:03,375
No, thanks.

800
01:04:03,625 --> 01:04:06,000
Please help me out, ha.

801
01:04:06,083 --> 01:04:07,000
If you buy from me,

802
01:04:07,083 --> 01:04:10,083
I can guarantee one hundred percent
customer satisfaction.

803
01:04:10,208 --> 01:04:11,375
Isn't this

804
01:04:12,333 --> 01:04:14,250
a waste of your talents?

805
01:04:14,333 --> 01:04:16,333
Are you sure about this?

806
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:18,458
I'm sure.

807
01:04:54,333 --> 01:04:57,333
Give me a better price next time.
I'll be a loyal customer.

808
01:05:13,708 --> 01:05:14,583
Come in for some water.

809
01:05:14,667 --> 01:05:15,833
Not bad, right?

810
01:05:17,458 --> 01:05:18,250
Sea snail. 50 each.

811
01:05:18,333 --> 01:05:20,542
Come back if you ever decide to quit.

812
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:22,542
I'll take all of this.

813
01:05:22,625 --> 01:05:23,917
Coming right up.

814
01:05:24,167 --> 01:05:25,042
I know.

815
01:05:25,625 --> 01:05:26,750
Next time, then.

816
01:05:26,833 --> 01:05:28,583
Look at them. Very lively.

817
01:05:29,667 --> 01:05:30,750
Thanks, bro.

818
01:05:31,167 --> 01:05:32,167
Hurry.

819
01:05:33,792 --> 01:05:35,500
Wait, put that down.

820
01:05:35,708 --> 01:05:37,958
This is my turf. What do you think you're doing?

821
01:05:39,083 --> 01:05:40,667
Who the hell are you?

822
01:05:41,583 --> 01:05:43,500
Wait. We're in the same line of work.

823
01:05:43,583 --> 01:05:46,000
- You better open your eyes.
- No need for violence.

824
01:05:46,125 --> 01:05:47,833
Maybe we want to get violent.

825
01:05:50,542 --> 01:05:51,583
Pal.

826
01:05:52,083 --> 01:05:54,250
Are you still buying this shipment?

827
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:04,417
Hey, put in some motor oil

828
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:05,875
and tune up the engine.

829
01:06:06,333 --> 01:06:08,333
Clean up the cabin while you're at it.

830
01:06:08,417 --> 01:06:09,958
Wait, I'm not done.

831
01:06:10,042 --> 01:06:12,333
Be sure to clean the bed, too.

832
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:15,000
Answer me!

833
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:18,375
Are you done talking? Can we talk later?

834
01:06:18,458 --> 01:06:19,250
What the hell does that mean?

835
01:06:19,333 --> 01:06:19,875
Listen,

836
01:06:19,958 --> 01:06:22,583
call your wife right now and tell her about me.

837
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:23,750
What do you want?

838
01:06:23,833 --> 01:06:25,958
Do you love me more or your wife more?
Tell me the truth.

839
01:06:26,292 --> 01:06:28,167
You told me you have a boat.

840
01:06:28,833 --> 01:06:31,250
I thought you have a huge yacht.

841
01:06:31,417 --> 01:06:32,417
You want the truth?

842
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:33,958
Alright, then.

843
01:06:34,167 --> 01:06:36,292
Do you love me or my boat?

844
01:06:36,375 --> 01:06:38,125
You gold digger

845
01:06:39,958 --> 01:06:41,625
how dare you!

846
01:06:42,375 --> 01:06:44,000
Is this what you wanted?

847
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:45,208
Are you happy?

848
01:06:45,292 --> 01:06:47,042
True enough for you?

849
01:06:50,708 --> 01:06:51,875
What?

850
01:06:52,792 --> 01:06:54,875
You've never seen a couple fight?

851
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:57,500
Go on with your damn business.

852
01:07:01,667 --> 01:07:02,917
Go on!

853
01:07:17,208 --> 01:07:18,792
It's none of your business.

854
01:07:20,417 --> 01:07:22,500
Are you okay, hone)”

855
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:24,542
where are you hurt? Let me see.

856
01:07:24,625 --> 01:07:26,583
Why are you fighting?

857
01:07:26,792 --> 01:07:27,833
How could you hit him?

858
01:07:27,917 --> 01:07:28,875
What's going on?

859
01:07:28,958 --> 01:07:31,458
This is my most important client!

860
01:07:33,458 --> 01:07:35,042
You will not get even a cent this month.

861
01:07:35,125 --> 01:07:37,792
I'm so sorry, Mr. cai.

862
01:07:37,875 --> 01:07:39,542
We'll compensate you for your troubles.

863
01:07:48,125 --> 01:07:49,333
My buddy says,

864
01:07:49,417 --> 01:07:51,042
cang is making drugs.

865
01:07:51,125 --> 01:07:52,750
Stay away from him.

866
01:07:54,083 --> 01:07:56,958
I'm at the Fisherman's wharf every morning
buying seafood.

867
01:07:57,042 --> 01:07:59,042
Come join me anytime.

868
01:07:59,125 --> 01:07:59,625
Police!

869
01:07:59,708 --> 01:08:01,167
Don't move.

870
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:02,417
Where did you get this?

871
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:03,000
Gang..-

872
01:08:03,083 --> 01:08:03,833
have you seen him.

873
01:08:03,917 --> 01:08:04,417
No.

874
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:05,625
Who's the dealer.

875
01:08:05,708 --> 01:08:07,833
His name is cang.

876
01:08:09,375 --> 01:08:10,250
Thanks.

877
01:08:10,333 --> 01:08:12,500
There are four, five people named cang here.

878
01:08:12,583 --> 01:08:15,125
One of them goes to a restaurant that
bought seafood from your brother.

879
01:08:20,583 --> 01:08:22,083
This guy looks suspicious as hell.

880
01:08:22,208 --> 01:08:23,792
Keep an eye on him.

881
01:08:29,667 --> 01:08:31,792
What the hell, man?

882
01:08:32,125 --> 01:08:33,792
How dare you show your face here again?

883
01:08:34,667 --> 01:08:36,125
You're not gonna give up, aren't you?

884
01:08:36,208 --> 01:08:37,458
So what?

885
01:08:37,542 --> 01:08:38,667
What'd you say?

886
01:08:39,708 --> 01:08:41,458
Do you know who's in charge here?

887
01:08:51,083 --> 01:08:52,375
How dare you touch my big brother?

888
01:09:00,667 --> 01:09:01,542
Let's go.

889
01:09:02,042 --> 01:09:03,667
Let's work together.

890
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:06,458
I can't do this job anymore.

891
01:09:26,917 --> 01:09:28,292
What's happened?

892
01:09:28,375 --> 01:09:30,792
It's hard to stay afloat in this business.

893
01:09:30,875 --> 01:09:33,000
Since the place is coming down,
might as well close for good.

894
01:09:33,083 --> 01:09:34,375
The world's changing too quickly.

895
01:09:34,458 --> 01:09:36,458
To see something so nice go to waste.
What a shame.

896
01:09:36,625 --> 01:09:38,500
That's the way it goes.

897
01:09:38,583 --> 01:09:40,167
Come on, drinks on me.

898
01:09:40,792 --> 01:09:41,625
Sounds good.

899
01:09:42,708 --> 01:09:44,667
Party time

900
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:13,917
let's celebrate.

901
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:15,292
For what?

902
01:10:15,375 --> 01:10:19,000
- No matter how much the world changes.
- Brotherhood never changes.

903
01:10:19,333 --> 01:10:21,458
I think we should make it offical.

904
01:10:22,042 --> 01:10:23,458
Let's make the blood oath.

905
01:10:26,125 --> 01:10:27,958
What a hard place to find.

906
01:10:29,125 --> 01:10:30,708
Interesting spot you got here.

907
01:10:31,125 --> 01:10:34,292
Kai, what a coincidence. Good to see you again.

908
01:10:34,792 --> 01:10:35,917
Are you stalking me?

909
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,167
Stalking?

910
01:10:37,250 --> 01:10:38,583
I have a lot of employees.

911
01:10:38,667 --> 01:10:40,208
They have time on their hands.

912
01:10:42,458 --> 01:10:44,625
What? You want to stir trouble again?

913
01:10:56,292 --> 01:10:57,375
Bro,

914
01:10:58,083 --> 01:10:59,458
I'm here to apologize.

915
01:10:59,542 --> 01:11:01,792
What happened last time was my fault.

916
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,667
Just get to the point.

917
01:11:22,375 --> 01:11:23,208
Sure.

918
01:11:23,875 --> 01:11:26,292
You've been away for the past few years,

919
01:11:26,625 --> 01:11:29,042
but the business has to go on.

920
01:11:29,125 --> 01:11:31,375
That's why I had to

921
01:11:31,458 --> 01:11:32,875
take over your Japan route.

922
01:11:32,958 --> 01:11:35,375
But I've expanded the range of cargo.

923
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:38,417
Now I move whatever makes the most money.

924
01:11:39,542 --> 01:11:41,333
You're just like rubberband.

925
01:11:41,708 --> 01:11:43,417
How can that be?

926
01:11:43,833 --> 01:11:46,167
Rubberband is always too rash.

927
01:11:48,667 --> 01:11:49,667
Kai,

928
01:11:50,292 --> 01:11:53,875
you know...
Okamura's a decent man with principles.

929
01:11:54,208 --> 01:11:55,292
What happened last time

930
01:11:55,375 --> 01:11:58,833
they know it wasn't personal,
so they are willing to let it go.

931
01:11:59,417 --> 01:12:01,417
Kai, I can tell

932
01:12:01,542 --> 01:12:03,375
that they're impressed with you.

933
01:12:04,208 --> 01:12:05,708
Stop stalling,

934
01:12:05,792 --> 01:12:07,792
I've left that behind long ago.

935
01:12:09,917 --> 01:12:12,500
Just tell me why you're really here.

936
01:12:13,583 --> 01:12:15,500
You're clever, Kai.

937
01:12:16,750 --> 01:12:22,167
Your little brother chao works
in the narcotics unit.

938
01:12:22,583 --> 01:12:24,917
He's getting a little too close.

939
01:12:26,042 --> 01:12:26,875
So...

940
01:12:26,958 --> 01:12:29,042
Why don't you invite him out for a drink?
Make some new friends.

941
01:12:29,125 --> 01:12:31,500
You want a cop to help your operation?

942
01:12:41,583 --> 01:12:44,500
The world's changed. Money is everything.

943
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:49,917
Money is what makes heroes nowadays.

944
01:12:54,167 --> 01:12:56,750
You've really mellowed.

945
01:13:01,333 --> 01:13:03,792
We've got a deal, then, Kai.

946
01:13:09,042 --> 01:13:11,542
I hear that ha isn't your godfather...

947
01:13:11,667 --> 01:13:13,333
But your real father.

948
01:13:13,417 --> 01:13:14,667
Is that so?

949
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:21,167
What are you guys chatting about?

950
01:13:22,750 --> 01:13:23,708
Not much.

951
01:13:23,792 --> 01:13:26,125
So you're hanging out with them again.

952
01:13:26,417 --> 01:13:27,833
I'm not.

953
01:13:28,333 --> 01:13:29,167
I told you,

954
01:13:29,250 --> 01:13:30,417
if you go back to your old ways, I'll...

955
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:31,708
You've got it wrong.

956
01:13:32,042 --> 01:13:32,625
What happened was...

957
01:13:32,708 --> 01:13:34,458
What happened was that I saw you with them.

958
01:13:34,542 --> 01:13:35,625
Can you let me finish?

959
01:13:35,708 --> 01:13:36,625
Go ahead.

960
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:39,583
Chaon.

961
01:13:39,667 --> 01:13:40,792
Don't call me chao.

962
01:13:41,292 --> 01:13:42,583
I'm a police officer.

963
01:13:44,625 --> 01:13:45,708
Sir.

964
01:13:47,042 --> 01:13:48,333
Officer.

965
01:13:48,417 --> 01:13:50,417
Where I live and whom I've met.
Go find out yourself

966
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:51,292
<i>lwill.</i>

967
01:13:51,375 --> 01:13:52,542
Why won't you believe me?

968
01:13:52,625 --> 01:13:53,583
I did, once.

969
01:13:53,667 --> 01:13:55,792
Then what happened?

970
01:13:55,875 --> 01:13:57,500
Why can't you give me a chance?

971
01:13:57,583 --> 01:13:58,542
I'm a man of my word.

972
01:13:58,625 --> 01:13:59,125
Sure.

973
01:13:59,208 --> 01:14:00,042
I'll give you a chance.

974
01:14:00,125 --> 01:14:01,458
A chance to leave this city.

975
01:14:01,542 --> 01:14:03,458
There are plenty of opportunities out there.

976
01:14:05,792 --> 01:14:07,167
I'm not leaving this city.

977
01:14:07,833 --> 01:14:09,500
This place is my home

978
01:14:12,292 --> 01:14:14,958
officer, I know where you can find drug dealers.

979
01:14:16,792 --> 01:14:18,250
Let's talk outside.

980
01:14:23,542 --> 01:14:25,500
My number. Call me if you need me.

981
01:14:25,917 --> 01:14:26,917
Wait.

982
01:14:32,333 --> 01:14:33,333
Who is he to you?

983
01:14:34,708 --> 01:14:36,458
Who is he to you? Your brother!

984
01:14:36,625 --> 01:14:38,500
- So what?
- What the hell do you mean?

985
01:14:38,583 --> 01:14:40,750
Look at how he's treated you.
Look at how you've treated him.

986
01:14:40,833 --> 01:14:41,708
Don't touch me!

987
01:14:41,792 --> 01:14:42,542
I'll do what I want!

988
01:14:42,625 --> 01:14:43,583
Do you have a brother?

989
01:14:43,667 --> 01:14:44,708
What do you know?

990
01:14:44,792 --> 01:14:47,083
I don't have a brother of my own,
but I know your big brother better than you.

991
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:48,042
I know.

992
01:14:48,125 --> 01:14:51,333
You are partners in crime.
Of course you understand him.

993
01:14:51,667 --> 01:14:53,292
It's been years. He paid his debt.

994
01:14:53,375 --> 01:14:54,375
Why can't you forgive him?

995
01:14:54,458 --> 01:14:55,833
I just don't.

996
01:14:56,458 --> 01:14:57,542
What's wrong with you?

997
01:14:57,625 --> 01:14:59,042
Assaulting a police officer?

998
01:15:03,375 --> 01:15:06,125
Look, I can arrest you right now.

999
01:15:06,208 --> 01:15:07,250
Go ahead!

1000
01:15:07,333 --> 01:15:09,458
You want to arrest your brother anyway,

1001
01:15:09,542 --> 01:15:10,458
so start with me.

1002
01:15:10,542 --> 01:15:12,417
You think I want to arrest him?

1003
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:15,417
Do you have any idea how terrible I felt
when I arrested him three years ago?

1004
01:15:15,542 --> 01:15:17,208
He's a wreck, too.

1005
01:15:18,708 --> 01:15:20,917
So, I don't want to do it again.

1006
01:15:20,958 --> 01:15:23,833
I don't want to cuff him again.

1007
01:15:23,833 --> 01:15:25,083
Stop it already!

1008
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:52,333
What do you want to know, handsome?

1009
01:16:52,417 --> 01:16:54,083
<i>Do you know gang'?</i>

1010
01:17:15,042 --> 01:17:17,250
Just hear me out

1011
01:17:17,375 --> 01:17:19,333
we didn't finish our conversation the other day.

1012
01:17:19,417 --> 01:17:21,750
The cops are on my ass.

1013
01:17:22,292 --> 01:17:24,708
Can you help me, Kai?

1014
01:17:25,208 --> 01:17:26,458
Who do you think I am?

1015
01:17:26,542 --> 01:17:28,292
I don't run the police.

1016
01:17:28,375 --> 01:17:29,917
I know,

1017
01:17:30,167 --> 01:17:31,292
but your little brother and his friends

1018
01:17:31,375 --> 01:17:33,000
are getting in my way.

1019
01:17:33,458 --> 01:17:34,375
They're pushing me hard

1020
01:17:34,458 --> 01:17:36,250
and if they force my hand,

1021
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:38,208
it won't be my fault.

1022
01:17:38,292 --> 01:17:39,417
What are you trying to say?

1023
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:40,625
Tell me exactly

1024
01:17:40,708 --> 01:17:41,875
what you're gonna do.

1025
01:17:42,333 --> 01:17:43,792
If anyone makes my life miserable

1026
01:17:43,875 --> 01:17:46,167
then I'm gonna make sure his life is, too.

1027
01:17:48,250 --> 01:17:49,458
Besides,

1028
01:17:49,542 --> 01:17:51,417
I know where

1029
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:52,792
your little brother lives.

1030
01:17:53,708 --> 01:17:55,583
For the sake of his safety...

1031
01:17:56,042 --> 01:17:57,042
Kai,

1032
01:17:57,625 --> 01:17:58,917
you should do something,

1033
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,542
seeing how you're his brother and all.

1034
01:18:36,833 --> 01:18:37,833
Be careful.

1035
01:18:37,917 --> 01:18:39,000
Don't mess it up.

1036
01:18:39,083 --> 01:18:40,083
Got it.

1037
01:18:43,417 --> 01:18:45,000
Ain't an easy place to find, is it?

1038
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
What are you up to now?

1039
01:18:48,625 --> 01:18:51,000
You really have some balls, don't you?

1040
01:18:55,917 --> 01:18:57,542
He's in conference room one, right?

1041
01:19:01,125 --> 01:19:03,208
Cheng, he's looking for inspector guo.

1042
01:19:03,292 --> 01:19:04,583
Let him wait. Inspector's in a meeting.

1043
01:19:04,667 --> 01:19:06,292
I'll ask for backup from special forces.

1044
01:19:06,375 --> 01:19:07,917
Then I'll lead this operation.

1045
01:19:08,625 --> 01:19:09,333
Sir,

1046
01:19:09,417 --> 01:19:10,833
this is urgent. It really is.

1047
01:19:10,958 --> 01:19:12,500
Those guys have guns.

1048
01:19:15,625 --> 01:19:16,500
What's going on?

1049
01:19:16,625 --> 01:19:17,792
What do you want?

1050
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:21,958
Can you send him away?

1051
01:19:22,042 --> 01:19:24,375
Why can't you tell me?

1052
01:19:27,208 --> 01:19:30,500
If a cop's older brother is a criminal,

1053
01:19:30,625 --> 01:19:32,500
the cop should recuse himself, right?

1054
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:36,125
What do you mean by criminal? Get to the point.

1055
01:19:36,250 --> 01:19:38,792
Calm down, chao. Let's talk.

1056
01:19:40,625 --> 01:19:41,583
Go on.

1057
01:19:43,250 --> 01:19:45,875
Why are you so anxious?

1058
01:19:47,042 --> 01:19:47,958
Take a seat.

1059
01:19:48,375 --> 01:19:49,333
Have some water.

1060
01:19:53,250 --> 01:19:54,333
Go ahead.

1061
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,917
I'll tell you everything you want to know.

1062
01:20:00,917 --> 01:20:02,167
In exchange,

1063
01:20:04,042 --> 01:20:05,958
keep chao off this case.

1064
01:20:17,750 --> 01:20:20,500
Tell me, what does Kai want?

1065
01:20:20,833 --> 01:20:21,958
This is my idea.

1066
01:20:24,167 --> 01:20:25,292
What do you want?

1067
01:20:27,958 --> 01:20:31,667
Lam just bored. I wanted to take a walk.

1068
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:39,042
I dare you to untie me.

1069
01:20:41,042 --> 01:20:42,667
Let him go. See what he'll do.

1070
01:20:51,208 --> 01:20:52,875
"The number you're dialing can't be reached..."

1071
01:20:56,292 --> 01:20:57,833
The superintendent sent you brother home.

1072
01:20:57,917 --> 01:20:58,958
What did he say?

1073
01:20:59,125 --> 01:21:02,000
He said the other man in the sewer back then

1074
01:21:02,083 --> 01:21:03,292
<i>was gang.</i>

1075
01:21:05,292 --> 01:21:06,625
Go grab a bite with me.

1076
01:21:07,542 --> 01:21:09,250
This takeout sucks.

1077
01:21:10,875 --> 01:21:11,792
Listen,

1078
01:21:11,917 --> 01:21:13,750
sit out of this afternoon's operation.

1079
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:15,667
Superintendent's orders.

1080
01:21:17,750 --> 01:21:18,875
Fire!

1081
01:21:18,958 --> 01:21:19,875
Come on!

1082
01:21:19,958 --> 01:21:21,208
Help!

1083
01:21:23,583 --> 01:21:24,667
I told you to be careful.

1084
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:26,542
You're in big trouble when cang comes back.

1085
01:21:29,042 --> 01:21:29,958
Sir,

1086
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:31,000
how do I get to this place.

1087
01:21:31,083 --> 01:21:31,917
He was gone when I turned around.

1088
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,792
Take a left, then another right.

1089
01:21:35,875 --> 01:21:37,375
- Did you order takeout?
- That's right.

1090
01:21:38,917 --> 01:21:40,292
Police, freeze!

1091
01:21:50,083 --> 01:21:51,125
Who's inside?

1092
01:21:54,750 --> 01:21:56,083
Six people inside, all armed.

1093
01:21:56,167 --> 01:21:57,167
All on the second floor.

1094
01:22:07,292 --> 01:22:07,833
Police!

1095
01:22:07,917 --> 01:22:08,625
Stop!

1096
01:22:13,958 --> 01:22:14,750
Stop the car!

1097
01:22:14,833 --> 01:22:15,833
Split up.

1098
01:22:20,958 --> 01:22:21,833
Freeze!

1099
01:22:28,542 --> 01:22:29,417
Freeze!

1100
01:22:54,792 --> 01:22:55,417
Are you alright?

1101
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:56,583
Who the hell are you?

1102
01:22:57,458 --> 01:22:58,500
Get out.

1103
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,208
My car's been jacked!

1104
01:23:03,708 --> 01:23:05,625
Police. I need your car.

1105
01:23:05,792 --> 01:23:06,917
What are you looking at? Get out!

1106
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,125
Get on. I will drive.

1107
01:23:08,208 --> 01:23:09,667
You amature. Get out!

1108
01:23:09,750 --> 01:23:10,500
Hurry up!

1109
01:23:24,667 --> 01:23:25,667
Freeze! Police!

1110
01:23:30,042 --> 01:23:31,667
We're going towards the tunnel.

1111
01:23:38,583 --> 01:23:39,958
I thought you were told to sit this one out.

1112
01:23:40,042 --> 01:23:41,292
You really are something.

1113
01:23:43,042 --> 01:23:46,000
Don't ram him in the city.
We don't want any casualties.

1114
01:23:52,667 --> 01:23:53,625
He's got nowhere to go.

1115
01:24:16,875 --> 01:24:17,875
Stop!

1116
01:24:19,083 --> 01:24:20,042
Stop!

1117
01:24:53,708 --> 01:24:55,167
I haven't been on the sea in ages.

1118
01:24:55,875 --> 01:24:58,375
The sea still looks beautiful from here.

1119
01:24:58,458 --> 01:24:59,375
Right?

1120
01:25:02,208 --> 01:25:03,792
The last time you were beat up like this

1121
01:25:03,875 --> 01:25:05,292
was ten years ago.

1122
01:25:08,250 --> 01:25:09,042
Right.

1123
01:25:09,625 --> 01:25:11,500
That was the first time you saved me.

1124
01:25:12,625 --> 01:25:13,625
It's been that long?

1125
01:25:13,708 --> 01:25:16,500
Look at you, still love to play the hero.

1126
01:25:16,625 --> 01:25:18,167
That's not true.

1127
01:25:18,250 --> 01:25:20,167
I just want a simple life.

1128
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:21,958
I have to finish what I've started.

1129
01:25:22,042 --> 01:25:23,417
You've already lost one leg.

1130
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:25,042
I will see it through even if I lose both legs.

1131
01:25:27,250 --> 01:25:28,375
Don't be stupid.

1132
01:25:30,083 --> 01:25:31,208
You are afraid

1133
01:25:31,292 --> 01:25:32,042
that's right.

1134
01:25:32,458 --> 01:25:34,000
I'm terrified.

1135
01:25:34,250 --> 01:25:36,000
I've already lost my father.

1136
01:25:36,292 --> 01:25:38,208
I'm afraid of losing my little brother, too.

1137
01:25:40,375 --> 01:25:41,625
He'll be just fine.

1138
01:25:42,167 --> 01:25:43,083
I don't know.

1139
01:25:43,167 --> 01:25:44,167
All I know

1140
01:25:44,250 --> 01:25:46,542
is that he won't stop what he's determined to do.

1141
01:25:46,625 --> 01:25:49,292
The more I try to stop him, the harder he'll go.

1142
01:25:49,375 --> 01:25:51,708
You two are exactly the same.

1143
01:25:52,333 --> 01:25:54,375
No way.

1144
01:25:54,458 --> 01:25:55,833
You want to go legit,

1145
01:25:55,917 --> 01:25:57,208
but he won't believe you.

1146
01:25:57,292 --> 01:26:00,333
You want him to forgive you,
but he wants to arrest you.

1147
01:26:00,625 --> 01:26:01,667
As for me,

1148
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:03,417
you'll always be my big brother,

1149
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:05,875
no matter what you do.

1150
01:26:09,708 --> 01:26:11,292
You'll have to choose a little brother to keep.

1151
01:26:25,875 --> 01:26:28,250
Police. Please cooperate.

1152
01:26:29,833 --> 01:26:30,917
I know.

1153
01:26:33,042 --> 01:26:34,000
My buddy says,

1154
01:26:34,083 --> 01:26:35,583
cang will go to Japan tomorrow

1155
01:26:35,667 --> 01:26:36,750
via a cargo ship.

1156
01:26:36,833 --> 01:26:38,083
Is he trying to flee?

1157
01:26:38,167 --> 01:26:38,875
That's right?

1158
01:26:38,958 --> 01:26:39,917
What do we do?

1159
01:26:40,750 --> 01:26:42,500
It's perfect. We'll finally have peace.

1160
01:26:42,583 --> 01:26:43,500
You'll let him get away?

1161
01:26:43,583 --> 01:26:45,042
That guy is nuts.

1162
01:26:45,125 --> 01:26:46,917
No one can stop him.

1163
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:47,750
Kai.

1164
01:26:48,042 --> 01:26:49,042
I can't just let him get away.

1165
01:26:49,125 --> 01:26:50,458
Listen to me for once.

1166
01:26:50,917 --> 01:26:52,250
Stay out of this.

1167
01:26:52,333 --> 01:26:53,458
It's over.

1168
01:26:54,375 --> 01:26:56,250
Sure,

1169
01:26:56,833 --> 01:26:58,833
I'll listen to you on this.

1170
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:04,750
What's going on?

1171
01:27:04,833 --> 01:27:05,875
That's what I should be asking you.

1172
01:27:05,958 --> 01:27:07,375
Where the hell is cang?

1173
01:27:10,042 --> 01:27:11,292
You must know.

1174
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,250
Where are you?

1175
01:27:13,417 --> 01:27:15,250
Let's talk face-to-face.

1176
01:27:15,333 --> 01:27:16,250
Fine.

1177
01:27:16,333 --> 01:27:18,542
Meet in front of the park in ten minutes.

1178
01:27:18,625 --> 01:27:19,583
I'll wait for you.

1179
01:27:24,042 --> 01:27:24,917
Well?

1180
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:25,958
We've searched all over.

1181
01:27:26,042 --> 01:27:27,250
Our big fish is gone.

1182
01:27:40,417 --> 01:27:45,792
"L say, it's better to spend life on the sea"

1183
01:28:14,250 --> 01:28:15,250
out of my way.

1184
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:18,750
Out of my way.

1185
01:28:19,458 --> 01:28:22,792
Doc.

1186
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,542
Where's the emergency room?

1187
01:29:06,042 --> 01:29:06,542
How is he?

1188
01:29:06,625 --> 01:29:07,542
They say that

1189
01:29:10,667 --> 01:29:12,625
he's conscious. He's not in any danger.

1190
01:29:13,167 --> 01:29:15,000
But the test results haven't come back yet.

1191
01:29:17,958 --> 01:29:19,000
Has he said anything?

1192
01:29:19,792 --> 01:29:21,250
He's still in a daze.

1193
01:29:21,667 --> 01:29:23,458
He just kept mumbling,

1194
01:29:23,542 --> 01:29:24,500
"can9~"

1195
01:29:24,833 --> 01:29:25,792
"can9~"

1196
01:29:26,875 --> 01:29:28,708
I'd better go inside.

1197
01:29:38,333 --> 01:29:39,625
We set out tonight.

1198
01:29:40,625 --> 01:29:41,458
Got it.

1199
01:29:41,542 --> 01:29:42,375
Let's do it!

1200
01:29:54,917 --> 01:29:56,000
Slow down.

1201
01:30:51,667 --> 01:30:52,458
Stop right there!

1202
01:30:53,333 --> 01:30:54,167
Jump.

1203
01:30:59,542 --> 01:31:00,375
Jump!

1204
01:31:01,917 --> 01:31:03,000
Help!

1205
01:31:11,583 --> 01:31:12,458
Let me help you, Kai.

1206
01:31:12,542 --> 01:31:14,083
I got it.

1207
01:31:14,167 --> 01:31:16,125
Help!

1208
01:31:46,333 --> 01:31:47,625
I can't breathe!

1209
01:31:47,708 --> 01:31:48,750
Save me!

1210
01:31:49,583 --> 01:31:51,000
Help me!

1211
01:31:52,292 --> 01:31:53,375
Please!

1212
01:31:59,167 --> 01:32:00,250
Take care of yourself.

1213
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,083
Are we almost there?

1214
01:32:41,292 --> 01:32:42,292
This is the fastest way.

1215
01:32:42,375 --> 01:32:43,375
I think we'll arrive after nightfall.

1216
01:32:43,458 --> 01:32:44,583
Have you told chao?

1217
01:32:44,667 --> 01:32:45,667
No rush.

1218
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:57,208
I forgot to ask you,

1219
01:32:57,292 --> 01:32:58,917
where did you get that gun?

1220
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,833
I brought it back from Japan.

1221
01:33:00,917 --> 01:33:02,417
I hid one in your boat, too,

1222
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:03,625
but you never found it.

1223
01:33:42,417 --> 01:33:43,500
Officer!

1224
01:33:43,750 --> 01:33:45,583
This is a personal feud.

1225
01:33:45,667 --> 01:33:47,708
Come save your wife yourself
if you have the balls.

1226
01:33:57,083 --> 01:33:59,042
Quan, help me trace this number

1227
01:33:59,125 --> 01:34:00,208
and tell me the current location.

1228
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:01,750
Don't tell inspector guo.

1229
01:34:04,542 --> 01:34:06,208
Never thought this would happen to you, did you?

1230
01:34:07,333 --> 01:34:09,708
My boys saw what you did.

1231
01:34:31,458 --> 01:34:32,833
I gotta talk to you.

1232
01:34:34,625 --> 01:34:35,708
Your brother...

1233
01:34:35,792 --> 01:34:36,833
Not about him.

1234
01:34:41,708 --> 01:34:42,875
Mei-lin...

1235
01:34:42,958 --> 01:34:44,917
She was a special girl.

1236
01:34:45,542 --> 01:34:47,208
But after she touched drugs,

1237
01:34:47,292 --> 01:34:49,208
anyone can have her.

1238
01:34:53,667 --> 01:34:54,667
I won't fight back.

1239
01:34:54,750 --> 01:34:55,542
Come on.

1240
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,042
I wanted you to know that

1241
01:35:01,042 --> 01:35:02,667
anything that you can have,

1242
01:35:03,417 --> 01:35:04,792
lcan,too.

1243
01:35:05,667 --> 01:35:06,708
By the way.

1244
01:35:07,292 --> 01:35:08,583
One night,

1245
01:35:08,667 --> 01:35:10,000
she called out the wrong name.

1246
01:35:10,083 --> 01:35:12,250
She called me Kai.

1247
01:36:11,250 --> 01:36:12,125
Where's Lulu?

1248
01:36:12,208 --> 01:36:12,792
She's not here.

1249
01:36:12,875 --> 01:36:14,667
You can talk to me instead.

1250
01:36:15,625 --> 01:36:16,917
Why the hell should I do that?!

1251
01:36:17,375 --> 01:36:18,917
Don't be so anxious.

1252
01:36:19,792 --> 01:36:22,042
Let's talk.

1253
01:36:25,042 --> 01:36:26,125
Mr. ha.

1254
01:36:26,292 --> 01:36:27,583
You impress me.

1255
01:36:27,667 --> 01:36:28,875
You really showed up

1256
01:36:28,958 --> 01:36:30,208
unarmed

1257
01:36:38,583 --> 01:36:39,667
where is Lulu?

1258
01:36:39,750 --> 01:36:41,083
Bring her out.

1259
01:36:48,708 --> 01:36:50,667
Don't be afraid, I'm right here.

1260
01:36:50,750 --> 01:36:52,500
Don't be scared, Lulu.

1261
01:37:01,292 --> 01:37:03,250
Tell me your terms.

1262
01:37:03,333 --> 01:37:05,667
Well, it was originally quite simple.

1263
01:37:05,750 --> 01:37:07,750
I just wanted you to leave my son alone.

1264
01:37:08,458 --> 01:37:09,542
But then,

1265
01:37:09,625 --> 01:37:11,667
your big brother had to take him.

1266
01:37:11,750 --> 01:37:13,250
That complicates things.

1267
01:37:13,333 --> 01:37:14,542
That puts me in a bind.

1268
01:37:14,625 --> 01:37:15,833
How so?

1269
01:37:15,917 --> 01:37:17,583
You tell me what I should do.

1270
01:37:17,667 --> 01:37:19,292
You want to take me as hostage?

1271
01:37:19,375 --> 01:37:20,333
That sounds about right.

1272
01:37:20,417 --> 01:37:21,750
But you have to let Lulu go.

1273
01:37:21,833 --> 01:37:23,917
You think I'm some dumb kid?

1274
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,667
The cops will raid this place once we let her go.

1275
01:37:31,750 --> 01:37:32,667
Fine.

1276
01:37:39,083 --> 01:37:40,625
I can't believe the way

1277
01:37:41,958 --> 01:37:43,333
you two brothers have treated me.

1278
01:37:43,417 --> 01:37:44,958
A loyal bunch you are.

1279
01:37:45,042 --> 01:37:46,208
Where are you?

1280
01:37:46,875 --> 01:37:48,125
The old bar

1281
01:37:48,250 --> 01:37:49,500
your are familiar with.

1282
01:37:49,583 --> 01:37:51,917
I'm warning you, do not hurt my brother.

1283
01:37:52,083 --> 01:37:54,292
<i>Get gang back to me</i>

1284
01:37:54,375 --> 01:37:56,667
without a single hair missing.

1285
01:37:56,750 --> 01:37:57,500
I'm on my way.

1286
01:37:57,583 --> 01:37:59,333
I'm waiting right here. I'm ready.

1287
01:37:59,458 --> 01:38:02,583
I, ha, care a great deal about loyalty.

1288
01:38:06,292 --> 01:38:07,625
What's going on, Kai?

1289
01:38:14,375 --> 01:38:15,500
The two of you are going back

1290
01:38:16,333 --> 01:38:18,708
even if it means certain death?

1291
01:38:18,792 --> 01:38:20,208
You're a righteous bunch.

1292
01:38:20,292 --> 01:38:21,458
The times have changed.

1293
01:38:21,542 --> 01:38:23,750
Shit happens to those who play heroes.

1294
01:38:27,708 --> 01:38:28,958
Will it be ok?

1295
01:38:29,542 --> 01:38:30,792
You can get off the boat first.

1296
01:38:31,750 --> 01:38:33,167
You want to take him on alone?

1297
01:38:33,792 --> 01:38:34,792
No way.

1298
01:39:08,917 --> 01:39:10,458
Don't blame me for being naggy.

1299
01:39:10,542 --> 01:39:12,292
Gang'

1300
01:39:12,375 --> 01:39:14,500
you just don't listen, do you?

1301
01:39:14,583 --> 01:39:16,542
You don't have to make all the money in the world.

1302
01:39:16,625 --> 01:39:17,958
You're causing me a lot of grief.

1303
01:39:18,042 --> 01:39:20,375
We've tried our best, chao.

1304
01:39:20,458 --> 01:39:22,750
We wanted to catch him for you,

1305
01:39:22,833 --> 01:39:23,542
but we didn't think...

1306
01:39:23,625 --> 01:39:24,875
Really, Kai,

1307
01:39:24,958 --> 01:39:28,833
you should've just left like you said you would.
Now you've capsized it.

1308
01:39:28,958 --> 01:39:29,833
That ain't right.

1309
01:39:29,917 --> 01:39:31,042
I have no choice.

1310
01:39:31,125 --> 01:39:32,083
You're steering it.

1311
01:39:32,167 --> 01:39:34,500
Enough bullshit. Send cang to me.

1312
01:39:37,375 --> 01:39:38,375
Ha,

1313
01:39:38,458 --> 01:39:39,875
from the looks of this,

1314
01:39:39,958 --> 01:39:41,833
I'm guessing we are not walking out of here alive.

1315
01:39:41,917 --> 01:39:43,000
I doubt that the two of you

1316
01:39:43,083 --> 01:39:44,625
came empty-handed.

1317
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:47,375
Now that we're here,

1318
01:39:47,458 --> 01:39:49,208
we're going to have some fun.

1319
01:39:49,292 --> 01:39:50,042
We're ready to play.

1320
01:39:50,125 --> 01:39:50,917
Sure.

1321
01:39:51,208 --> 01:39:52,750
Let's make a bet.

1322
01:39:52,833 --> 01:39:54,458
You know,

1323
01:39:54,792 --> 01:39:56,000
I have some toys of my own.

1324
01:39:56,083 --> 01:39:57,042
How about that?

1325
01:39:57,125 --> 01:39:58,167
Let's play-

1326
01:39:59,625 --> 01:40:00,667
hell yes.

1327
01:40:08,958 --> 01:40:10,083
Looks like

1328
01:40:10,167 --> 01:40:12,167
a bloodbath is going down tonight.

1329
01:40:14,167 --> 01:40:15,083
You chicken?

1330
01:40:16,292 --> 01:40:17,917
I wanted to leave a beautiful corpse,

1331
01:40:18,292 --> 01:40:20,208
so I got myself a haircut.

1332
01:40:25,958 --> 01:40:27,083
When do we move?

1333
01:40:27,167 --> 01:40:28,250
Wait and see.

1334
01:40:37,958 --> 01:40:38,792
Don't move!

1335
01:40:38,875 --> 01:40:40,042
Put your guns down.

1336
01:41:25,333 --> 01:41:26,750
Cops aren't even here yet,

1337
01:41:26,833 --> 01:41:28,542
you're already done?

1338
01:41:29,250 --> 01:41:30,500
I told you,

1339
01:41:30,583 --> 01:41:32,458
I got some fun toys

1340
01:41:32,958 --> 01:41:34,542
you want to mess with me?

1341
01:41:34,625 --> 01:41:37,333
I, ha, care a great deal about loyalty.

1342
01:41:37,417 --> 01:41:39,917
But that depends on whom I'm speaking to

1343
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,917
you want to play with me?

1344
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,625
You're not qualified.

1345
01:41:44,583 --> 01:41:47,000
Too bad you can't see me take to the sea.

1346
01:41:49,125 --> 01:41:50,333
Come out.

1347
01:41:52,583 --> 01:41:53,375
Don't move.

1348
01:41:53,458 --> 01:41:55,083
Put down the gun.

1349
01:41:56,292 --> 01:41:57,542
No sudden moves.

1350
01:41:57,625 --> 01:41:58,833
Are you two ok?

1351
01:41:58,917 --> 01:41:59,542
I'm fine.

1352
01:41:59,625 --> 01:42:00,292
I'm ok, too.

1353
01:42:00,375 --> 01:42:01,333
Get outta here.

1354
01:42:04,792 --> 01:42:06,333
I'm sorry.

1355
01:42:09,958 --> 01:42:11,250
But it's ok.

1356
01:42:12,333 --> 01:42:16,125
Loyalty doesn't exist anymore.

1357
01:42:17,917 --> 01:42:19,958
The world's changed.

1358
01:42:21,792 --> 01:42:24,167
You come between me and my money, you die.

1359
01:42:25,250 --> 01:42:26,625
He's really lost his mind.

1360
01:42:26,792 --> 01:42:27,792
We gotta go.

1361
01:42:28,333 --> 01:42:29,833
Lulu's still on the boat.

1362
01:42:30,833 --> 01:42:32,042
Come out,

1363
01:42:32,125 --> 01:42:33,500
zhou Kai!

1364
01:42:33,583 --> 01:42:36,083
I'm gonna kill you, then board my boat.

1365
01:42:36,667 --> 01:42:37,708
What the hell are you looking at?

1366
01:42:37,792 --> 01:42:39,625
I'm the boss now.

1367
01:42:39,958 --> 01:42:42,500
Kill!

1368
01:42:47,417 --> 01:42:48,292
Chao.

1369
01:42:58,625 --> 01:42:59,750
Do you have your phone?

1370
01:43:02,708 --> 01:43:03,958
We're in the middle of nowhere.

1371
01:43:04,042 --> 01:43:05,667
Backup will take a while to get here.

1372
01:43:05,750 --> 01:43:06,750
Don't do anything.

1373
01:43:06,833 --> 01:43:08,208
Just stay here.

1374
01:43:08,583 --> 01:43:10,125
We'll deal with them.

1375
01:43:10,583 --> 01:43:11,792
I'm a cop.

1376
01:43:11,875 --> 01:43:13,125
Who the hell do you think you are?

1377
01:43:13,208 --> 01:43:14,125
If you go in,

1378
01:43:14,208 --> 01:43:16,208
how is it different from a gangland gunfight?

1379
01:43:16,292 --> 01:43:17,458
It is different.

1380
01:43:17,542 --> 01:43:19,875
Because we're brothers. Get it?

1381
01:43:20,333 --> 01:43:21,750
I appreciate that,

1382
01:43:21,833 --> 01:43:23,625
but people are killed here today.

1383
01:43:23,708 --> 01:43:24,875
So what?

1384
01:43:24,958 --> 01:43:25,958
We'll take responsibility.

1385
01:43:26,042 --> 01:43:27,083
That's enough.

1386
01:43:27,167 --> 01:43:28,667
Hey guys,

1387
01:43:28,750 --> 01:43:30,500
I'm running out of Patience.

1388
01:43:31,208 --> 01:43:32,708
Get your asses out here.

1389
01:43:32,792 --> 01:43:33,917
You know,

1390
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,042
your girl is on the boat.

1391
01:43:36,125 --> 01:43:38,875
Maybe I should do something about that.

1392
01:43:39,792 --> 01:43:41,750
I'm going to do one last thing for you.

1393
01:43:43,750 --> 01:43:45,333
I'm going to get her out.

1394
01:43:46,625 --> 01:43:47,375
I'm going with you.

1395
01:43:47,458 --> 01:43:48,167
No.

1396
01:43:48,250 --> 01:43:49,667
I can do this myself.

1397
01:43:49,750 --> 01:43:50,667
Stay here and watch him.

1398
01:43:50,750 --> 01:43:51,333
No way.

1399
01:43:51,417 --> 01:43:52,542
Don't you know that is suicide?

1400
01:43:52,625 --> 01:43:53,750
You're disobeying me again.

1401
01:43:53,833 --> 01:43:55,083
That's right.

1402
01:43:55,167 --> 01:43:56,292
We're blood brothers.

1403
01:43:56,375 --> 01:43:57,833
We'll die together.

1404
01:45:54,042 --> 01:45:55,875
What is wrong with you people.

1405
01:45:57,583 --> 01:45:59,750
You know you'll get yourself killed,

1406
01:45:59,833 --> 01:46:02,042
but you still want to play heroes.

1407
01:46:02,125 --> 01:46:03,792
No one could stop you.

1408
01:46:03,875 --> 01:46:05,958
Don't you know how dumb that is?

1409
01:46:08,083 --> 01:46:11,833
These days, whoever has money is the hero.

1410
01:46:11,917 --> 01:46:14,500
You're dinosaurs, get it?

1411
01:46:15,667 --> 01:46:16,875
As long as

1412
01:46:17,125 --> 01:46:20,458
this boat brings in money, it'll never sink.

1413
01:46:21,875 --> 01:46:22,792
Zhou Kai,

1414
01:46:23,417 --> 01:46:25,458
looks like you won't be able to save anyone.

1415
01:46:25,542 --> 01:46:26,417
Am I right?

1416
01:46:28,917 --> 01:46:30,250
Let's end it here.

1417
01:46:56,250 --> 01:46:58,125
Gang'

1418
01:47:05,333 --> 01:47:07,208
I spared you once.

1419
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:10,125
I beg you...

1420
01:47:10,792 --> 01:47:12,833
Please let go of my two brothers.

1421
01:47:14,458 --> 01:47:16,083
You can take my life.

1422
01:47:36,708 --> 01:47:37,750
Look at this,

1423
01:47:37,833 --> 01:47:39,792
even to the very end,

1424
01:47:39,875 --> 01:47:42,792
you two brothers couldn't have a proper reunion.

1425
01:49:31,083 --> 01:49:33,125
The brotherly oath.

1426
01:49:35,792 --> 01:49:36,833
Brother.
