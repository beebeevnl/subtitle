1
00:01:34,025 --> 00:01:37,439
Hot, hot, hot! Ow, sun, sun.

2
00:02:06,349 --> 00:02:07,715
Oh, no.

3
00:02:27,328 --> 00:02:30,742
Okay, then. On your marks.

4
00:02:37,213 --> 00:02:42,254
<i>It's not unusual to be
loved by anyone</i>

5
00:02:42,635 --> 00:02:47,300
<i>It's not unusual to have
fun with anyone</i>

6
00:02:48,016 --> 00:02:52,056
<i>If you should ever want
to be loved by anyone</i>

7
00:02:53,188 --> 00:02:56,647
<i>It's not unusual to find
that I'm in love with you</i>

8
00:03:03,948 --> 00:03:05,029
<i>...pathetic.</i>

9
00:03:05,241 --> 00:03:06,948
<i>I'm just a bat, myself.</i>

10
00:03:21,508 --> 00:03:22,965
Stop it.

11
00:03:24,344 --> 00:03:28,429
I am the Prince of Darkness.
I do not do cuddly!

12
00:03:39,692 --> 00:03:43,686
...right there in front of everybody,
"Keep the car, it'll be worth it"...

13
00:03:45,532 --> 00:03:47,148
I'm sorry.

14
00:03:47,867 --> 00:03:51,702
No, not worth it to "ow".
Worth it to get rid of her.

15
00:03:54,249 --> 00:03:57,708
Quiet! What is that noise?
Do you hear that?

16
00:04:01,256 --> 00:04:02,713
Oh, it's me.
It's my pocket vibrating.

17
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,846
<i>Hello?</i>

18
00:04:16,563 --> 00:04:17,929
Er, hello?

19
00:04:18,314 --> 00:04:20,931
Oh, hi. I want your teeth.

20
00:04:21,317 --> 00:04:23,730
<i>Excuse me?
- Your fake vampire teeth. You see...</i>

21
00:04:24,112 --> 00:04:27,696
<i>...I've been looking everywhere.
You are my last hope.</i>

22
00:04:28,074 --> 00:04:31,784
I can assure you, madam,
I may be getting on in years...

23
00:04:32,036 --> 00:04:34,528
...but my teeth
are very much my own.

24
00:04:34,873 --> 00:04:37,741
This is 'Vampires R Us'?
The costume store?

25
00:04:38,042 --> 00:04:40,876
This is Dracula.

26
00:04:42,714 --> 00:04:43,750
Who?

27
00:04:44,757 --> 00:04:48,091
Dracula.
The Prince of Darkness.

28
00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:52,759
No? The Bat Out Of Hell.
The Scourge of Transylvania.

29
00:04:53,349 --> 00:04:54,715
King of bats.

30
00:04:55,685 --> 00:04:58,678
Okay... Dracula.
I'm hanging up now.

31
00:04:59,063 --> 00:05:01,680
Stop! No, please don't hang up.
Please.

32
00:05:01,691 --> 00:05:03,603
Er, why not?

33
00:05:03,985 --> 00:05:05,226
It's...

34
00:05:05,612 --> 00:05:09,481
...it's just so nice to finally have
someone to talk to.

35
00:05:09,991 --> 00:05:13,280
Are you lonely?

36
00:05:13,995 --> 00:05:16,282
So, so very lonely.

37
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:20,916
<i>Well, we could chat some more
if you want?</i>

38
00:05:21,336 --> 00:05:25,250
I would like that very much.

39
00:05:25,632 --> 00:05:30,878
What's your name,
fair maiden?

40
00:05:31,262 --> 00:05:33,345
Emma. Emma Wishbone.

41
00:05:33,723 --> 00:05:36,716
Well, Emma Wishbone, maybe...

42
00:05:37,602 --> 00:05:39,719
<i>...it was fate itself
that brought us together.</i>

43
00:05:41,898 --> 00:05:45,107
<i>Are you alright?
I'm sorry, that was lame.</i>

44
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:51,397
<i>Hello? Hello, Emma?!
- Oh, come back!</i>

45
00:05:52,116 --> 00:05:55,826
<i>Hello? I can barely hear you.</i>

46
00:05:56,204 --> 00:06:00,039
Great. Now I get to buy a
new phone I can't afford.

47
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:03,659
Off, you stupid thing!

48
00:06:16,891 --> 00:06:19,634
Emma Wishbone

49
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:22,561
Renfield!

50
00:06:38,246 --> 00:06:42,365
Find me Emma Wishbone.
And I will make her my wife.

51
00:06:45,295 --> 00:06:48,584
And bring in my washing.
I think it's going to rain.

52
00:06:50,133 --> 00:06:52,500
Do you know what today is not,
Cheyenne?

53
00:06:52,635 --> 00:06:54,251
Your day?

54
00:06:54,846 --> 00:06:56,087
Precisely.

55
00:06:56,222 --> 00:06:59,215
Darling, you say that every day.

56
00:07:01,644 --> 00:07:06,856
Yes, but today, instead of calling a
costume store, I ended up talking to Dracula.

57
00:07:06,858 --> 00:07:09,475
And because of that,
my phone fell into the drain.

58
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,272
Who did you speak to?

59
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,237
Just some weirdo.

60
00:07:14,365 --> 00:07:15,856
Why do these things keep happening?

61
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,073
Let me relax you with a massage.

62
00:07:27,211 --> 00:07:29,919
It's as if there's a curse
on this entire family.

63
00:07:30,006 --> 00:07:33,420
Max is having a hard time at school
and the shop is in decline.

64
00:07:33,551 --> 00:07:36,134
Max, show us your experiment.

65
00:07:36,512 --> 00:07:39,050
Fellow classmates, I present you -

66
00:07:39,474 --> 00:07:41,887
the Solar System.

67
00:07:42,268 --> 00:07:45,887
Our group of planets
orbit the magnificent Sun.

68
00:07:45,897 --> 00:07:49,356
It burns at
27 million degrees Fahrenheit.

69
00:07:49,734 --> 00:07:52,818
But one day, in around
five billion years time...

70
00:07:53,196 --> 00:07:55,984
...the Sun will start to cool
and the Earth will be plunged...

71
00:07:56,366 --> 00:07:57,902
...into a deadly ice age.

72
00:07:58,284 --> 00:08:01,868
The whole planet will be covered with ice.

73
00:08:02,663 --> 00:08:05,747
And all life will end.

74
00:08:06,084 --> 00:08:07,666
Any questions?

75
00:08:08,044 --> 00:08:11,503
Yeah. How do you wanna die?

76
00:08:11,881 --> 00:08:13,793
<i>My daughter Fay...</i>

77
00:08:14,175 --> 00:08:17,088
...desperately wants to be
a grown-up.

78
00:08:17,512 --> 00:08:19,094
<i>"I'm the only one for you"</i>

79
00:08:19,514 --> 00:08:24,100
<i>"Because I only love me
I only love me"</i>

80
00:08:24,268 --> 00:08:27,432
Fay, if you fancy this guy so much,
why not talk to him?

81
00:08:27,814 --> 00:08:29,806
He only goes for model material.

82
00:08:30,191 --> 00:08:34,401
<i>"I only love me on my own."
- That is just so cool. - Awesome.</i>

83
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:36,645
Is it something new of yours?
- Yes...

84
00:08:37,031 --> 00:08:41,947
You're really pretty, Fay.
- Sure. Didn't you see my last magazine cover?

85
00:08:42,328 --> 00:08:45,617
Well then, see you tonight,
ladies.

86
00:08:45,998 --> 00:08:48,206
Oh, no, Sheila,
he's coming over here.

87
00:08:48,584 --> 00:08:51,748
So you smile then say 'Hi'.
- That's way too complicated.

88
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:54,213
No, all you need is a push.

89
00:09:00,805 --> 00:09:04,389
Well that's one way of meeting.
What's your name?

90
00:09:07,979 --> 00:09:09,436
Er, Girdl.

91
00:09:09,814 --> 00:09:11,305
You're called Girdl?

92
00:09:13,818 --> 00:09:15,525
Flmm.

93
00:09:15,903 --> 00:09:17,439
Flmm?

94
00:09:18,865 --> 00:09:20,276
Flam.

95
00:09:20,658 --> 00:09:23,150
Okay, Flam.

96
00:09:24,537 --> 00:09:26,745
Do you feel like
getting off me now?

97
00:09:28,332 --> 00:09:31,791
- Oh, Fay.
- Yeah, sure.

98
00:09:39,552 --> 00:09:42,090
Earth to Fay.
- We're looking for...

99
00:09:42,305 --> 00:09:46,299
...some pretty girls for our new video.
And we're shooting it tonight.

100
00:09:47,018 --> 00:09:49,305
So?
- So, you're a pretty girl.

101
00:09:49,687 --> 00:09:52,771
I am?
- See you tonight.

102
00:09:53,608 --> 00:09:54,724
Flam.

103
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:00,942
He thinks I'm pretty.

104
00:10:01,324 --> 00:10:05,864
Isn't that your brother over there?
- Brother? Who?

105
00:10:06,204 --> 00:10:07,991
Oi, get back here, you geek!

106
00:10:12,585 --> 00:10:15,919
<i>And Frank,
Frank is never home.</i>

107
00:10:27,183 --> 00:10:30,597
Wishbone, I want these
loan applications by tomorrow.

108
00:10:30,811 --> 00:10:34,225
But I wanted to be home on
time today to see my family.

109
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:37,813
You love your family?
- Yeah, of course.

110
00:10:38,194 --> 00:10:40,982
Then avoid getting fired!

111
00:10:41,364 --> 00:10:44,653
Leaving them with absolutely
nothing to eat.

112
00:10:46,035 --> 00:10:48,948
What is that?
- Stress gives me wind.

113
00:10:55,628 --> 00:10:57,745
Sorry, guys.
- Come on, Frank!

114
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:00,213
Smells like something crawled
inside you and died.

115
00:11:00,591 --> 00:11:04,335
And now I can't even find
vampire teeth for my costume.

116
00:11:07,181 --> 00:11:10,174
I just wanted us to do
something as a family again.

117
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,928
We used to have so much fun.
Dressing up, going to parties.

118
00:11:14,272 --> 00:11:15,638
Look what I've found.

119
00:11:16,023 --> 00:11:18,356
Where did you get them?
- Charity shop.

120
00:11:18,734 --> 00:11:21,442
Used teeth.

121
00:11:21,821 --> 00:11:24,234
Just one careful owner.

122
00:11:24,615 --> 00:11:28,029
What's wrong?
- I just wish we had a party to go to.

123
00:11:28,411 --> 00:11:30,778
You mean like this?

124
00:11:31,163 --> 00:11:34,076
Monster Costume Party.
- Wow.

125
00:11:34,584 --> 00:11:36,871
Cheyenne, this is perfect!

126
00:11:37,253 --> 00:11:39,495
My family will love it!

127
00:11:41,465 --> 00:11:45,459
When was the last time
we did something fun together?

128
00:11:52,184 --> 00:11:54,301
Don't know, don't care.

129
00:11:54,687 --> 00:11:57,680
One year, nine months
and 23 days ago.

130
00:11:58,065 --> 00:11:59,806
So we've got some
catching up to do.

131
00:12:00,192 --> 00:12:03,560
I've got to get ready for my date.
And I need to catch up on cold fusion.

132
00:12:03,946 --> 00:12:05,733
I've got work to do.

133
00:12:06,115 --> 00:12:08,983
But I've already made
the costumes, see?

134
00:12:11,662 --> 00:12:14,450
<i>My baby don't care for rings</i>

135
00:12:14,832 --> 00:12:17,620
<i>Or other expensive things</i>

136
00:12:18,002 --> 00:12:19,868
<i>My babyjust cares...</i>

137
00:12:20,254 --> 00:12:21,790
<i>for me</i>

138
00:12:24,508 --> 00:12:27,717
<i>My babyjust cares for me</i>

139
00:12:28,846 --> 00:12:34,308
My dear old friend, what would you say
if I offered you your freedom?

140
00:12:34,435 --> 00:12:35,221
Release me?

141
00:12:35,436 --> 00:12:38,144
If you can still perform
your transformation spell.

142
00:12:38,314 --> 00:12:39,850
I can.

143
00:12:44,695 --> 00:12:47,312
My amulet.

144
00:12:49,367 --> 00:12:52,531
By fire, by light,
by all things bright!

145
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,507
Here, prove it on this.

146
00:13:28,155 --> 00:13:32,240
Don't we look great?

147
00:13:32,618 --> 00:13:35,611
Mum, you're really embarrassing.

148
00:13:36,497 --> 00:13:37,954
No matter...

149
00:13:38,332 --> 00:13:41,200
No matter what I do,
you think I'm embarrassing.

150
00:13:41,419 --> 00:13:45,538
When I put on make-up, I'm embarrassing.
When I don't, I'm embarrassing.

151
00:13:45,923 --> 00:13:50,133
When I wear a miniskirt, I'm embarrassing.
- No, then you're not embarrassing.

152
00:13:50,553 --> 00:13:51,384
I'm not?

153
00:13:51,595 --> 00:13:53,086
You're just really sad.

154
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:56,844
Well I think mum is beautiful.
- Don't be so scared all the time.

155
00:13:57,017 --> 00:13:57,803
I'm not scared.

156
00:13:58,018 --> 00:14:00,635
If you stood up for yourself,
you wouldn't get beaten up.

157
00:14:00,813 --> 00:14:02,395
Are you being bullied at school?

158
00:14:02,565 --> 00:14:04,352
I'd rather be a suck-up
than fail my exams.

159
00:14:04,567 --> 00:14:06,354
You're failing your exams?

160
00:14:06,736 --> 00:14:08,102
Don't hit your brother!

161
00:14:08,446 --> 00:14:11,029
Fay!
- You didn't say anything about kicking.

162
00:14:11,282 --> 00:14:14,616
Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent.
- Dictionary mouth.

163
00:14:14,994 --> 00:14:17,702
Frank, can you say something?!
- What? Something.

164
00:14:17,955 --> 00:14:19,821
Well you did ask, Mum.

165
00:14:19,957 --> 00:14:22,370
Don't you get smart, Max.
- Too late.

166
00:14:22,752 --> 00:14:23,993
Frank!

167
00:14:24,378 --> 00:14:28,998
You will transform
this woman into a vampire.

168
00:14:29,383 --> 00:14:33,002
But, Dracula, you are.

169
00:14:33,387 --> 00:14:37,301
Why not simply bite her yourself?

170
00:14:37,683 --> 00:14:41,552
If I bite her,
she will lose her soul.

171
00:14:41,937 --> 00:14:45,556
And her soul is exquisite.

172
00:14:45,941 --> 00:14:49,150
Difficult spell this is,
on humans.

173
00:14:49,487 --> 00:14:53,356
Will only work
if the person is unhappy.

174
00:14:59,872 --> 00:15:02,159
Wow, a red carpet.

175
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,288
This really looks like
my kind of party.

176
00:15:05,669 --> 00:15:08,412
- There you are.
- Hi.

177
00:15:08,798 --> 00:15:12,041
We're here for the party.
- Yeah, I know, dear. Follow me.

178
00:15:12,426 --> 00:15:14,338
This way
- Okay.

179
00:15:15,888 --> 00:15:17,675
I have them.
- Wow...

180
00:15:18,057 --> 00:15:21,141
...we're really getting the VIP treatment.

181
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,978
Good job, Mum.
- Didn't I tell you it would be fun?

182
00:15:27,817 --> 00:15:30,651
Let's rock.

183
00:15:31,028 --> 00:15:33,941
And where exactly is here?

184
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:39,743
What sort of party is this?

185
00:15:40,538 --> 00:15:42,530
Oh, and why are we on a stage?

186
00:15:42,915 --> 00:15:46,784
Why are we the only ones
wearing costumes?

187
00:15:47,628 --> 00:15:49,995
They think we're the band.

188
00:15:53,884 --> 00:15:56,547
Okay, then, we can do this.

189
00:15:57,471 --> 00:16:03,968
Silent night, Holy night,

190
00:16:04,353 --> 00:16:06,845
All is...

191
00:16:18,951 --> 00:16:20,817
Imposters!

192
00:16:21,829 --> 00:16:26,745
I have a feeling that Emma is
very, very unhappy.

193
00:16:27,376 --> 00:16:30,335
Then enchant her, I can.

194
00:16:30,713 --> 00:16:32,170
Excellent.

195
00:16:37,177 --> 00:16:39,669
And fix this before you go.

196
00:16:42,474 --> 00:16:44,090
Hm? Ach.

197
00:16:47,688 --> 00:16:50,601
I need a holiday.

198
00:16:55,613 --> 00:16:59,527
Well that was less than ideal.
- Why don't you talk like a regular person?

199
00:16:59,909 --> 00:17:01,866
Can't you just be nice to
your brother?

200
00:17:02,244 --> 00:17:04,952
It's the last thing
I feel like doing.

201
00:17:05,623 --> 00:17:08,832
I'm sorry.
- That was totally humiliating,

202
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:12,247
and it's all your fault.
- It was an accident.

203
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:15,998
No-one wanted to come on your
stupid family outing.

204
00:17:16,383 --> 00:17:18,295
Well I wanted to study.

205
00:17:18,636 --> 00:17:21,003
You are so ungrateful.

206
00:17:21,388 --> 00:17:23,926
Hey, come on,
don't shout at the kids.

207
00:17:24,308 --> 00:17:26,174
Finally, he wakes up!

208
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,303
Can you to drive us home
before you fall asleep again?

209
00:17:29,647 --> 00:17:33,266
Yeah. I'm just working so hard.
- And I'm not?!

210
00:17:33,651 --> 00:17:37,816
Well, I wouldn't exactly call
making these costumes 'hard work'.

211
00:17:40,366 --> 00:17:42,904
I hate that my daughter
does nothing but insult me.

212
00:17:43,285 --> 00:17:45,868
And I hate that my kids
are always fighting.

213
00:17:46,246 --> 00:17:49,785
And I hate that my husband
just sleeps through it all.

214
00:17:53,754 --> 00:17:57,794
Work it will, my transformation spell.

215
00:18:02,513 --> 00:18:04,880
So very unhappy, you are.

216
00:18:05,265 --> 00:18:08,133
Perceptive, you are.

217
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:10,431
Help, Baba Yaga will.

218
00:18:10,813 --> 00:18:14,056
Really? How?
- By cursing you.

219
00:18:14,441 --> 00:18:16,228
What? Sorry?

220
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:20,695
By fire, by light,
by all things bright.

221
00:18:21,073 --> 00:18:23,110
Yeah. Now, dear, don't
you have a cat somewhere...

222
00:18:23,492 --> 00:18:26,075
...that needs feeding?

223
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:27,656
Or something?

224
00:18:36,422 --> 00:18:39,005
Great, now it's gonna be raining.

225
00:18:39,383 --> 00:18:42,376
By day, by night...

226
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,463
I really think we're witnessing
actual magic.

227
00:18:45,848 --> 00:18:48,716
That's impossible.
- Do you have another explanation?

228
00:18:49,101 --> 00:18:50,717
Not really.

229
00:18:59,236 --> 00:19:01,899
You will be transformed tonight!

230
00:19:17,296 --> 00:19:19,709
Why won't they come off?

231
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:23,379
Hold on, I'll help you.

232
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,386
Get off!

233
00:19:32,936 --> 00:19:36,555
Not the nicest way to treat
your brother.

234
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,351
Max?

235
00:19:42,571 --> 00:19:43,982
I'm hairy.

236
00:19:44,156 --> 00:19:45,988
All over.

237
00:19:55,084 --> 00:19:56,746
Dad?

238
00:20:00,089 --> 00:20:01,751
Oh, that's dad.

239
00:20:05,094 --> 00:20:08,053
What have you done
to my family?

240
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:11,719
Opala. Actually, I only wanted
to transform you.

241
00:20:12,101 --> 00:20:14,138
If everyone is transformed,

242
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,603
then everyone must be unhappy.

243
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:20,690
I'm transformed?
- See for yourself.

244
00:20:24,655 --> 00:20:26,772
I'm an ugly old witch!

245
00:20:27,157 --> 00:20:29,820
No, that's me.

246
00:20:30,202 --> 00:20:32,194
You've now become
a reflectionless vampire.

247
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:35,697
I'm a, I'm a vampire?

248
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:37,119
Yes.

249
00:20:39,044 --> 00:20:41,912
Disappear, pronto!

250
00:20:42,297 --> 00:20:44,334
Where did she go?

251
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,972
Some time, this might take.

252
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,932
Come back here.

253
00:20:55,853 --> 00:20:58,937
Disappear, pronto!

254
00:21:00,149 --> 00:21:03,733
Curse it.
Amulet not fully charged.

255
00:21:04,111 --> 00:21:08,321
Okay, Emma, last year
you went to the gym...

256
00:21:08,699 --> 00:21:09,860
...twice!

257
00:21:13,162 --> 00:21:16,246
Wow, it really paid off.

258
00:21:19,084 --> 00:21:21,326
I'm coming,
you old witch!

259
00:21:21,712 --> 00:21:24,125
Baba Yaga, you won't catch.

260
00:21:24,506 --> 00:21:26,293
Oh, really? How do you know?

261
00:21:26,675 --> 00:21:29,213
In tea leaves,
I have read.

262
00:21:29,595 --> 00:21:32,429
Must have been a typo.

263
00:21:43,358 --> 00:21:46,522
He-he, capture yourself, you have.

264
00:21:46,904 --> 00:21:51,274
Just practising for when
I catch you.

265
00:22:15,307 --> 00:22:17,845
Out of way!

266
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:27,107
Move, stupid birds!

267
00:22:32,824 --> 00:22:35,362
Watch your step!

268
00:22:47,422 --> 00:22:50,335
Who leaves their laundry out this late?

269
00:22:53,595 --> 00:22:55,507
Disappear, pronto!

270
00:23:08,986 --> 00:23:12,400
We really need to talk flossing.

271
00:23:12,781 --> 00:23:14,272
Get back here!

272
00:23:39,766 --> 00:23:41,007
Disappear, pronto!

273
00:23:50,193 --> 00:23:51,684
Disappear, pronto!

274
00:23:56,658 --> 00:23:58,900
Unhappy woman
not giving up.

275
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:13,359
So how's that disappearing spell
working for you?

276
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:17,909
Big, big power needed
for big, big magic.

277
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,873
Amulet must recharge at place
of great spiritual energy.

278
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:25,371
Oh, great. We'll come with you and
you can transform us back.

279
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:27,463
Sorry, sweetie.

280
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:31,255
Alone I travel
...to Oculus Londra

281
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:33,424
Ocula what?

282
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:38,095
Oculus Londra.

283
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:45,599
Not only is this not my day...

284
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:48,193
...it is also not my night.

285
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:02,995
Not Londra, this is.

286
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:07,416
Never working,
this piece of rubbish.

287
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:11,633
Useless, you are.
Still long way to travel.

288
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:21,968
Where are the kids?

289
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:25,480
Uffta.

290
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:27,645
What?
- Uffta.

291
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:31,862
Frank, you still know who I am,
don't you?

292
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:35,277
Uffta.
No, I'm Emma.

293
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:38,993
Memma?
- Yes. Your wife.

294
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:41,454
Uffta?

295
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:49,705
Good to see that something
hasn't changed.

296
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:55,840
I think I might be in with a
real chance here. Mustn't blow it.

297
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:58,718
Renfield!
Go and pack my things...

298
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:02,722
...I'm going to meet my future bride.

299
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:07,306
Very funny.

300
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,857
He passes Kobe Bryant...

301
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:18,074
...leaves LeBron James in the dust.
And he scores! Yeah!

302
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:31,625
Don't eat me.

303
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:34,841
I've just had chilli
I'll go right through you.

304
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:38,219
Help me!

305
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:41,055
Not so nice being scared, is it?

306
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,425
You, you can speak?

307
00:26:43,811 --> 00:26:46,349
Nothing gets past you, genius.

308
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:51,066
No. No, my trousers...

309
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,812
No...

310
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:12,795
It's me, Fay.

311
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:18,677
Who?
- Flamm?

312
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,842
That costume really isn't the look
we're going for...

313
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:25,968
...in the music video.
- It's not a costume.

314
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:27,889
I'm a mummy.

315
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:30,764
Some crazy witch has cursed
my whole family.

316
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:34,894
Okay, someone's had way too
much Halloween candy.

317
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,154
Here, touch me.
See for yourself.

318
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:40,531
Wow, that's so...

319
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:43,242
You're so... mouldy.

320
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,156
You've got to help me.

321
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:49,123
You know I would but
I've got like a ton of homework.

322
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:52,244
You think I'm disgusting,
don't you?

323
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,746
No. You're great.

324
00:27:55,132 --> 00:27:58,876
You're the best looking decaying corpse
I've ever seen.

325
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:04,385
Yeah, well, you're not
so hot either.

326
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:09,973
Fay?

327
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:12,559
Max?!

328
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,484
Are you here?

329
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:19,821
Careful. Watch, watch your...

330
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:26,612
...head.
- Moobid ming.

331
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:30,206
You really don't wanna break that,
it was a present from your mother.

332
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:33,292
I always thought it was ugly anyway.

333
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:36,788
Mum? Dad? Is that you?

334
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:43,799
Mummy!

335
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:47,299
Oh, Max.

336
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:54,105
Okay, that's new.

337
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:12,240
Fay, are you okay...

338
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:14,788
...sweetie?
Don't you dare "sweetie" me.

339
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:18,789
This is all your fault!
- What?

340
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:23,714
If you hadn't made us wear these stupid
costumes, we wouldn't be in this mess.

341
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:30,475
Look, we're gonna find the witch...

342
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:34,562
...and I'll make her change us back.
I promise.

343
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:38,149
And how are you gonna do that?
Look her up online?

344
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:41,611
She said she was going to somewhere
called Oculus Londra.

345
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:44,902
Ocula whatnow?
- Yes, that's just what I said.

346
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:47,617
Oculus Londra means
London Eye.

347
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:49,452
That's a big Ferris Wheel in London.

348
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:52,080
So the witch wants to go
on a Ferris Wheel?

349
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:56,667
I've read at school that the London Eye is
built on an ancient magical site.

350
00:29:57,045 --> 00:30:00,959
The witch must be going there to
recharge her powers.

351
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,087
So we're going to London?

352
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,300
Moliday.

353
00:30:12,603 --> 00:30:16,017
Oh, this is no way Londra.

354
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:19,482
Disappear, pronto!

355
00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:26,027
That is some serious
spiritual reshaping.

356
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:27,732
Tell me about it.

357
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:30,280
I just coughed up
a fur ball.

358
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:33,329
Thanks for taking us to the airport, Cheyenne.
- No problem.

359
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:38,247
Life is a journey and I like
to travel in style.

360
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:42,213
I'm really glad
dogs are colour blind.

361
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:45,459
<i>Five, four, three...</i>

362
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,507
This is not Londra.

363
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:51,176
Disappear, pronto!

364
00:30:54,645 --> 00:30:57,558
Fay, we will find the witch,
I promise

365
00:30:57,939 --> 00:31:00,272
It's not just that.

366
00:31:00,651 --> 00:31:03,689
Finally a boy thought
I was pretty and now...

367
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:07,690
...he can't even look at me.
- Beauty doesn't last.

368
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:11,239
It doesn't matter what anyone
else thinks, Fay.

369
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:14,363
You have to know yourself
how special you are.

370
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,958
You don't need other people
to tell you.

371
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:22,295
I remember feeling like that.
Never mind.

372
00:31:22,673 --> 00:31:25,837
I'm gonna get you there.
Here we go!

373
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:43,475
Mind out!

374
00:31:51,702 --> 00:31:54,115
Off we go.
- No, stop.

375
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:57,864
What are you doing?
- You can't go out there.

376
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:01,664
It's daylight.
- So? - You're a vampire.

377
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:05,880
You'll burn up.
- But I've got to get on that plane.

378
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:10,298
Well, there are legends
that say vampires with souls...

379
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:13,672
...might be able to survive
contact with the sun.

380
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,923
Well, great. Let's go.

381
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:19,097
But they're only legends.
Who knows if they're true?

382
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:21,896
Well, I guess there's only
one way to find out.

383
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:26,143
No, Mum, don't!

384
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:39,364
Oh...

385
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:43,792
Well, I guess that answers
that question.

386
00:32:44,171 --> 00:32:49,838
Thank you, magnificent sun, for not
burning my dear friend to a crisp.

387
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:55,801
Mum? What if I said I might
not want to be changed back?

388
00:32:56,183 --> 00:33:00,427
I like people being scared of me.
- Oh, darling, I know what you mean.

389
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:05,853
Are you nuts? I look like a 3,000 year
old meatloaf and dad is a...

390
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,475
...gigantic farting idiot!

391
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:12,276
Okay, that's not so new.
- Fay!

392
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,115
I'm just saying, if you two
back out now...

393
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:18,658
...it's totally unfair!

394
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,998
Nobody is backing out.

395
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:25,456
Max, right now you think it's great that
people are scared of you.

396
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:30,457
But scary people are lonely because
nobody wants to be around them.

397
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:34,131
Which fortune cookie did you read that in?
- Quiet, Fay.

398
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:36,800
Everyone act naturally.

399
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,140
How can I...

400
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:43,478
...be of assistance?
- Go on.

401
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:46,438
Hello.
Five tickets to London, please.

402
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,437
Actually, that's four people
and a dog.

403
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:53,313
He travels everywhere with us.
This little one is part of the family.

404
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:57,116
Isn't that right, Buster?

405
00:33:57,327 --> 00:33:59,034
Of course.

406
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:04,324
And why is Mr Wishbone two feet
taller than stated here?

407
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:07,417
Growth hormones. In the meat.

408
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:11,540
Don't you watch the news?
- And what's going on...

409
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:14,042
...with your daughter?

410
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:18,216
Acne. Puberty, you know.
Very severe case.

411
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:24,097
And what about you?
- Me? Oh, yes,

412
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,812
I've been performing in
"Dracula, the Musical" in London.

413
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:30,934
I thought I'd get into costume now
and save time.

414
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,527
Very impressive.
The dog will definitely have to travel...

415
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,400
...in the hold with the luggage.

416
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:37,531
Do you have a cage for it?

417
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,529
Mum, I don't want to
travel with the luggage.

418
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:43,871
Don't worry, Max.
I mean Buster.

419
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:52,588
That was me.
I'm a ventriloquist.

420
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:56,968
Hello there, madam,
I'm a dog. Give me a biscuit, please.

421
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:02,139
If you could just bear with me
for one second.

422
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:06,595
Security, we've got
a bit of a problem.

423
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:10,060
I can't look like this
for the rest of my life.

424
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,316
We have to get to London,
find the witch...

425
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:15,152
...so that she can make us
human again.

426
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:18,527
You have to let us on that plane.
You have to.

427
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:23,453
<i>Hello?</i>

428
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:27,949
No problem. And I'll upgrade you
to First Class.

429
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:34,000
Here you go, your tickets.
- Thank you.

430
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:38,418
Let's go, Frank.

431
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,260
Have a good flight.

432
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:43,302
Didn't I tell you that
everything would be fine?

433
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:47,477
I have no idea what just happened
- You can hypnotise people.

434
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:50,642
It's just like in. 'The Curse Of The Mummy'.
- Really?

435
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:54,184
Mummy,
I need a bigger allowance.

436
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:57,357
Don't even think about it,
young lady.

437
00:35:57,739 --> 00:36:01,983
I would try that with dad.

438
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,871
Look, girls...

439
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:11,083
...that's what happens when
you over-exfoliate.

440
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:20,835
You are all big stupid monkeys.

441
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:29,223
And she has got a banana.

442
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:38,940
Fay!

443
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:42,861
Mum, if I have to look like this...

444
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:46,452
...at least let me have some fun.

445
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:54,827
Mocolate.

446
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,125
Chocolate for everyone!

447
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,545
Fay, stop this immediately.

448
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:05,718
Come on, Mum, this is much better
than an in-flight movie.

449
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:13,805
What's wrong?
- I'm just...

450
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:18,560
...I'm just so hungry.

451
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:22,564
So eat this.
- No.

452
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:27,652
How about tomato juice?

453
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:46,011
Okay. Who are you
and what's going on?

454
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:48,548
Does the name...

455
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:51,346
..."The Prince Of Darkness"...

456
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:55,062
...ring any bells?

457
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,899
I, well...
I am Dracula.

458
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:03,567
Dracula?
How did you get on this plane?

459
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:07,658
I could not wait to meet you,
my thorny rose.

460
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:12,238
And now, my dear,
to the matter in hand.

461
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:15,082
Well, in your hands,
actually.

462
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:18,411
Drinking the blood of humans
is such a messy affair...

463
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:21,289
...and considered quite common
these days.

464
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:25,258
Not to mention the matter of
disposing of the leftovers.

465
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:28,512
Leftovers?
- Come with me.

466
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,132
Come with you?
- To where you belong.

467
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:35,353
To my castle.
- But... but I, I...

468
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:40,100
I can't leave my
family behind.

469
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:43,649
Would you rather stay and drain these
people of their life-force...

470
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:47,774
...in order to quench your
insatiable thirst?

471
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:52,153
No.

472
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:57,992
I'll come with you.
- I hoped you might.

473
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:12,966
This place is not being Londra either.
Disappear, pronto!

474
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:22,274
Forgive the mask, I'm not overly
fond of the sun.

475
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:26,521
I know, how about
a parachute?

476
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:30,153
Parachutes
are for wimps.

477
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:48,505
Just out of interest,
where are we flying?

478
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:52,138
Towards our future together.

479
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:06,109
Call me pampered but...

480
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:10,106
...I like to travel in style.

481
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,869
Memma?

482
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:19,999
She was right here.
- Where's she gone?

483
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,760
Hey, give me that.

484
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:35,173
Come on. Jump.
You can do it if you try.

485
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:40,098
That's gonna be handy.

486
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:44,478
A little jest.
Only I can do that.

487
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:52,322
This is a bit sudden, don't you think?

488
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,657
Your lunch.

489
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:59,155
What on earth is this?

490
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:02,951
I want blood, not a pill.

491
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:07,751
Trust me, Emma.
- But how can I trust you? You're Dracula.

492
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,419
That's why only I know what you need.

493
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,597
Yes, it's an acquired taste.

494
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:27,057
It's working.

495
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:30,315
I'm changing back.

496
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:33,360
Why are you helping me?

497
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:36,108
You're the first person
in a thousand years...

498
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:39,987
...who has lifted my melancholy.
- That's so sad.

499
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:42,623
No, because you have
been worth the wait.

500
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:46,210
Finally there's someone who can
understand me and share my life.

501
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,795
Romantically.

502
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,256
A vampire wife.

503
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:57,631
Wait, did you send that
witch after us?

504
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:06,393
Witch? No, I don't know any witches.
Do they even really exist?

505
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,936
I want to get back
to my family.

506
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:13,111
Do they really make you happy?

507
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:18,026
Well... sometimes.

508
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:21,867
"Sometimes" is nowhere near enough
for you, my darling.

509
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:24,991
You deserve to be happy "always".

510
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,955
I will devote myself to...

511
00:42:28,338 --> 00:42:31,957
...showing you a life beyond
your wildest dreams.

512
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:41,883
Our home would be
my castle.

513
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:49,519
<i>But we will travel...</i>

514
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:53,227
<i>...to the most romantic places.</i>

515
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:21,221
<i>I will give you this world...</i>

516
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:25,551
<i>...and worlds beyond.</i>

517
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:02,505
It could be wonderful.

518
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:07,138
Can your husband offer you anything
like that?

519
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:12,390
We did play Scrabble on a Tuesday night
last May for no particular reason.

520
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:17,145
Then what are you waiting for,
my love? Follow your heart to me.

521
00:44:17,572 --> 00:44:19,609
Oh. I...

522
00:44:20,283 --> 00:44:22,570
...I have to get back to my family.

523
00:44:26,873 --> 00:44:29,991
You would choose
to be unhappy?

524
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:34,586
No. But when you're a mother,
you have to take the good with the bad.

525
00:44:34,964 --> 00:44:37,547
Well if you're that sure,
don't let me keep you.

526
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:41,502
You could have just called me a cab!

527
00:44:46,726 --> 00:44:50,891
If mum doesn't show up here...
- ...we might never see her again.

528
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:54,936
Emma will be fine, guys.
Relax.

529
00:44:55,318 --> 00:44:59,858
Tai chi with me. I call this one...

530
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:03,362
'Chicken Flies Into The Soup'

531
00:45:06,996 --> 00:45:08,282
Mum?

532
00:45:08,748 --> 00:45:10,114
Memma.

533
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:13,451
Coming!

534
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:16,749
Mummy!
I really need to practise that.

535
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:19,168
You're back!
- We thought we'd never see you again.

536
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:22,213
I'm fine. It's okay.

537
00:45:22,595 --> 00:45:25,178
Memma. Memma. Memma.

538
00:45:25,598 --> 00:45:28,511
Gently, gently, gently.

539
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:33,512
So what's with the disappearing act?

540
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:35,981
Did you ever think of
calling your family?

541
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:38,976
Yes, we were really worried.
Where have you been?

542
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:42,230
It wasn't that easy.
Dracula has a way...

543
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:46,697
...of hypnotising you.
- Dracula, the vampire?

544
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:49,536
No, Dracula, the hair stylist.

545
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:52,907
So, is he handsome?
Like in the films?

546
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:54,867
Mammsome?

547
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:58,124
He's kind of looking for love.

548
00:45:58,506 --> 00:45:59,963
Mmove?

549
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:06,094
Renfield!

550
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:09,761
Prepare Operation Ice Age.

551
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:14,637
If I can't have love,
then no-one can.

552
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:18,231
I will eliminate all
life on Earth.

553
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:20,817
Oh and tell Baba Yaga...

554
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:24,438
...I have something
particularly nasty planned for her...

555
00:46:24,824 --> 00:46:29,068
...if she doesn't destroy
this 'happy family'...

556
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:31,661
...immediately!

557
00:46:35,084 --> 00:46:37,701
This not Londra.

558
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:40,287
Hi.

559
00:46:42,675 --> 00:46:45,713
Disappear, pronto!

560
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:54,138
Mig Men.

561
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:56,095
Big Ben.

562
00:46:56,689 --> 00:46:59,306
Mig Men.

563
00:46:59,692 --> 00:47:02,685
It's the witch.

564
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:05,904
Oculus wrong again.
- Get her!

565
00:47:06,282 --> 00:47:09,320
This is Londra.

566
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,531
There's no way I'm jumping
in after her.

567
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:15,155
Of course not,
scaredy-cat.

568
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:19,831
Oh, could you please stop arguing
just for once.

569
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,462
Oh, no, not this
crazy magic again.

570
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:30,087
What is she doing?
Is she going to change us back?

571
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:44,943
It's about time.
Let's go.

572
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:47,483
Change us back
so we can fly home.

573
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:51,609
No, do I will not.
Fully charged, my amulet is.

574
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:54,577
Now finish my task,
I can.

575
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:58,665
So Baba Yaga free can be,
at last.

576
00:48:04,408 --> 00:48:05,615
No.

577
00:48:09,413 --> 00:48:11,951
Stay here,
you little piece of...

578
00:48:15,627 --> 00:48:18,620
Enough, messed up my work,
you have.

579
00:48:19,006 --> 00:48:24,422
By air, by sky.
Now you will fly...

580
00:48:24,803 --> 00:48:27,295
...to Egypt!

581
00:48:28,390 --> 00:48:31,224
Curse it again, all of them I've hit.
- No...,

582
00:48:31,602 --> 00:48:33,468
...not all of them.

583
00:48:45,282 --> 00:48:48,241
So who thinks the evil witch
just tricked us?

584
00:48:48,619 --> 00:48:51,783
That would probably explain why
we're now in Egypt.

585
00:48:52,164 --> 00:48:54,326
This is not a problem.

586
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:58,619
We are getting out of this desert and
finding that witch.

587
00:48:59,004 --> 00:49:01,212
And how do you think
we should do that?

588
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:04,924
I haven't worked that out yet
but, come on...

589
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:08,173
...we're a family.
We can do anything.

590
00:49:08,555 --> 00:49:13,175
Follow me! We're getting out
of this desert.

591
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:21,648
Bring back my friend.
- Never.

592
00:49:22,027 --> 00:49:25,862
You run fast
for an old crone.

593
00:49:27,115 --> 00:49:28,822
Disappear, pronto!

594
00:49:30,369 --> 00:49:32,577
Not cool.

595
00:49:38,835 --> 00:49:40,747
My amulet.

596
00:49:49,513 --> 00:49:50,549
Got it!

597
00:49:57,688 --> 00:50:00,305
Hold on.

598
00:50:03,026 --> 00:50:06,736
Take my hand!
- Trust you, why should I?

599
00:50:09,241 --> 00:50:12,359
Because I'm one of
the good guys.

600
00:52:14,658 --> 00:52:17,742
Imprison me, Dracula did,
for a thousand years.

601
00:52:18,119 --> 00:52:21,829
The more I hear about that guy,
the less I like him.

602
00:52:22,207 --> 00:52:25,200
And then freedom,
he promised me,

603
00:52:25,544 --> 00:52:27,376
if I did his evil bidding.
- So now...

604
00:52:27,754 --> 00:52:30,918
...will you turn the
Wishbones back?

605
00:52:31,299 --> 00:52:33,461
Do that, only they
themselves can.

606
00:52:33,844 --> 00:52:35,881
Really? But how?

607
00:52:36,263 --> 00:52:38,846
Only when happy they are...

608
00:52:39,224 --> 00:52:42,433
...human they
will become again.

609
00:52:42,811 --> 00:52:45,269
Well, I guess they'd
better get used...

610
00:52:45,689 --> 00:52:47,976
...to being monsters.

611
00:52:50,652 --> 00:52:51,813
Renfield!

612
00:52:55,907 --> 00:52:57,739
The fate of the world...

613
00:52:58,118 --> 00:53:00,531
...rests in my hand.

614
00:53:00,912 --> 00:53:03,370
The innocent snowflake...

615
00:53:03,748 --> 00:53:06,582
...engineered into
a deadly weapon.

616
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,997
Behold what this tiny flake...

617
00:53:09,379 --> 00:53:12,463
...alone can achieve.

618
00:53:35,322 --> 00:53:37,814
Now imagine billions
of these flakes...

619
00:53:38,199 --> 00:53:41,033
...pressed together into
an icy sphere.

620
00:53:41,411 --> 00:53:44,620
With that I will destroy
the Sun itself.

621
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:48,750
And the Earth will be plunged
into a deadly ice age.

622
00:54:03,058 --> 00:54:04,174
Mum?

623
00:54:04,893 --> 00:54:08,386
Mummy! I found footprints.

624
00:54:08,772 --> 00:54:09,888
Footprints?

625
00:54:10,273 --> 00:54:13,937
Well, we just have to follow them
and we're saved.

626
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:16,561
- Uffta.
- Uffta.

627
00:54:16,947 --> 00:54:18,279
Mummy...

628
00:54:18,657 --> 00:54:21,866
- Yes?
- These are our own footprints.

629
00:54:22,243 --> 00:54:24,781
Oh...

630
00:54:25,163 --> 00:54:27,200
Mhat?
- Everything will be okay.

631
00:54:27,666 --> 00:54:29,498
How? Look around.

632
00:54:29,876 --> 00:54:32,584
We're in a giant,
enormous sandpit!

633
00:54:32,963 --> 00:54:35,296
You're making it sound
as if this is my fault.

634
00:54:35,674 --> 00:54:39,839
Well, you are the one who gave the
amulet back to the evil witch.

635
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:42,883
Everything always has to be your way...

636
00:54:43,348 --> 00:54:45,305
...and we just have to deal with it.

637
00:54:46,685 --> 00:54:49,223
You don't actually think I'm good
at anything, do you?

638
00:54:49,604 --> 00:54:53,439
No. Well you're great at making us look
hideous and completely monstrous.

639
00:54:53,650 --> 00:54:56,313
You know how to ruin our lives
better than anyone.

640
00:54:56,695 --> 00:55:00,359
And I'm gonna be smelly
and ugly for ever!

641
00:55:00,699 --> 00:55:03,112
Why can't I have a daughter
who is nice...

642
00:55:03,493 --> 00:55:05,576
...who doesn't beat up her brother
who doesn't flunk school...

643
00:55:05,954 --> 00:55:08,822
...and who doesn't make me feel
like an actual monster?!

644
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,253
I'm so very sorry, sweetie.

645
00:55:16,923 --> 00:55:21,008
Then maybe you should find another daughter.
- Fay. Come back!

646
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:25,463
I'm counting to three.
One, two...

647
00:55:25,849 --> 00:55:27,385
three...

648
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,301
87...

649
00:55:30,687 --> 00:55:32,303
88...

650
00:55:32,689 --> 00:55:33,645
89...

651
00:55:34,065 --> 00:55:36,432
I don't think she's coming back.

652
00:55:37,193 --> 00:55:40,027
Max, I'm sorry, but that really
doesn't help at all.

653
00:55:42,115 --> 00:55:45,699
Oh, great. Fay's not here
so you're yelling at me.

654
00:55:46,453 --> 00:55:48,740
I'm through with this family.

655
00:55:49,122 --> 00:55:52,365
I'm a lone wolf now.

656
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:57,169
Max, I'm counting to three.

657
00:55:58,173 --> 00:55:59,414
One...

658
00:55:59,758 --> 00:56:00,965
two...

659
00:56:03,386 --> 00:56:05,503
741...

660
00:56:05,889 --> 00:56:08,256
742...

661
00:56:08,641 --> 00:56:11,384
Oh...

662
00:56:11,770 --> 00:56:14,979
Why is it whenever I need
you most, you stand there and...

663
00:56:15,356 --> 00:56:18,394
...don't say a word?!
- Uffta?

664
00:56:18,777 --> 00:56:22,942
Well it's too late to start now.
- Uffta?

665
00:56:23,323 --> 00:56:26,316
I can't deal with this any more!

666
00:56:26,701 --> 00:56:28,738
Just go away! Move!

667
00:56:43,802 --> 00:56:45,293
Uffta.

668
00:56:46,387 --> 00:56:48,128
Memma.

669
00:56:50,558 --> 00:56:53,767
We're better off apart.

670
00:56:59,192 --> 00:57:01,980
Emma has left her family.

671
00:57:02,362 --> 00:57:05,981
I might have just been given
a second chance.

672
00:57:06,366 --> 00:57:09,450
I'm going to fly
back to my Emma!

673
00:57:09,828 --> 00:57:12,741
Renfield,
pause Operation Ice Age.

674
00:57:43,278 --> 00:57:46,066
Oh, I'm so hungry.

675
00:57:49,033 --> 00:57:50,569
I need blood.

676
00:57:55,331 --> 00:57:58,540
Dinner time.

677
00:58:10,763 --> 00:58:14,598
And just when you think things
can't get any weirder...

678
00:58:14,976 --> 00:58:17,559
You are trespassing in my desert.

679
00:58:17,896 --> 00:58:19,808
...you meet a talking whirlwind.

680
00:58:26,404 --> 00:58:28,862
Nobody enters my...

681
00:58:31,034 --> 00:58:34,118
Welcome to Egypt...

682
00:58:34,495 --> 00:58:36,157
...beautiful creature.

683
00:58:41,628 --> 00:58:43,711
Here it's hot.

684
00:58:44,672 --> 00:58:46,755
Finally some shade.

685
00:58:57,227 --> 00:59:01,221
Cut it out.
I don't need a haircut.

686
00:59:10,949 --> 00:59:14,192
No-one messes
with Weremax!

687
00:59:23,711 --> 00:59:25,202
Melp.

688
00:59:28,299 --> 00:59:29,915
Melp.

689
00:59:37,642 --> 00:59:40,885
Whose great idea was it
to have a...,

690
00:59:41,271 --> 00:59:45,515
...fashion photo shoot
in the desert?

691
01:00:00,999 --> 01:00:02,535
Girls.

692
01:00:05,962 --> 01:00:07,544
I say.

693
01:00:19,475 --> 01:00:25,517
<i>Come a little closer, honey
Come to me</i>

694
01:00:30,278 --> 01:00:33,146
Whoa!

695
01:00:34,532 --> 01:00:38,196
Gosh,
you surely startled us.

696
01:00:38,578 --> 01:00:41,742
What are you doing out
here all alone?

697
01:00:43,124 --> 01:00:46,037
Are you alright, dear?
You look a little pale.

698
01:00:46,461 --> 01:00:48,828
And you look delicious.

699
01:01:07,857 --> 01:01:12,067
My darling needs me and
here I am.

700
01:01:12,445 --> 01:01:14,186
May I?

701
01:01:34,258 --> 01:01:37,547
Oh, my, what a man.

702
01:01:37,553 --> 01:01:43,595
<i>Come a little closer, honey
Come to me</i>

703
01:01:50,942 --> 01:01:53,275
am Pharaoh Imhotep.

704
01:01:54,112 --> 01:01:57,321
You're Johnny Depp?
- Im-ho-tep!

705
01:01:57,698 --> 01:01:59,690
Oh, okay, great and sandy one.

706
01:02:03,996 --> 01:02:06,363
You are very beautiful.

707
01:02:06,582 --> 01:02:10,576
Me? - I have lived
for more than 3,000 years...

708
01:02:10,962 --> 01:02:16,253
...and in all that time I have
met no-one as beautiful as you.

709
01:02:18,010 --> 01:02:22,471
Come, let me show you
the true power of the mummy.

710
01:02:26,811 --> 01:02:30,680
You, too, can do this.

711
01:02:31,691 --> 01:02:36,857
Yeah.
You simply have to wish it.

712
01:02:38,781 --> 01:02:41,865
So nice.
- Uffta!

713
01:03:14,692 --> 01:03:17,810
Welcome home.

714
01:03:20,072 --> 01:03:23,156
Wow. Are you sure
you've got enough room?

715
01:03:27,497 --> 01:03:29,705
Would you give me
the honour...?

716
01:04:18,381 --> 01:04:20,919
Hold tight!

717
01:04:23,553 --> 01:04:26,261
Stay with me, Emma
and make me the happiest...

718
01:04:26,681 --> 01:04:30,015
...immortal plasma-dependent
fiend on Earth.

719
01:04:45,074 --> 01:04:47,782
Hey, anything on four legs
stays on a lead!

720
01:04:48,077 --> 01:04:50,615
Who's on four legs?

721
01:05:01,299 --> 01:05:04,713
Hi.

722
01:05:05,094 --> 01:05:07,131
It's okay,
I won't hurt you.

723
01:05:09,765 --> 01:05:13,304
<i>Scary people are lonely because
nobody wants to be around them.</i>

724
01:05:16,522 --> 01:05:19,981
Wow, this is amazing!

725
01:05:43,966 --> 01:05:47,130
Welcome to my home.

726
01:05:47,511 --> 01:05:48,968
For thousands of years...

727
01:05:49,347 --> 01:05:52,260
...I have waited for a woman
like you.

728
01:05:52,642 --> 01:05:54,929
One who is special.

729
01:05:55,311 --> 01:05:58,895
One whose beauty shines brighter...

730
01:05:59,273 --> 01:06:00,935
...than the sun.

731
01:06:02,902 --> 01:06:06,270
One with whom I can...
conquer the world.

732
01:06:06,656 --> 01:06:09,069
Er, conquer the world?

733
01:06:11,827 --> 01:06:15,537
<i>I'm a lazy boy
I watch the sun shine</i>

734
01:06:15,831 --> 01:06:18,539
<i>Lighting up
the peerless peaceful sea</i>

735
01:06:21,379 --> 01:06:23,120
Moliday!

736
01:06:26,342 --> 01:06:28,379
Ladies.

737
01:06:31,764 --> 01:06:33,756
Uffta?

738
01:06:34,058 --> 01:06:36,391
I'll take it from here, girls.

739
01:06:42,692 --> 01:06:46,402
You're certainly taking your time
to decide, my love.

740
01:06:46,779 --> 01:06:49,396
That's going to hurt
in the morning.

741
01:06:51,617 --> 01:06:55,076
So, darling,
will you be mine?

742
01:06:58,666 --> 01:07:02,626
They're better off without me.
I accept.

743
01:07:06,549 --> 01:07:09,417
Then I am more happy than
any man living or dead

744
01:07:09,802 --> 01:07:12,419
...has reason to be. Renfield!

745
01:07:15,057 --> 01:07:18,425
Show my fiancée to her chamber.

746
01:07:18,811 --> 01:07:20,848
And prepare my Lazarus bath.

747
01:07:21,230 --> 01:07:24,143
I think I'm starting to
sag a little.

748
01:07:24,525 --> 01:07:28,235
Now that we have finally
found each other...

749
01:07:28,612 --> 01:07:32,105
...we have the immense power
to rule the world like gods.

750
01:07:32,450 --> 01:07:35,568
No-one will disobey
our commands.

751
01:07:35,953 --> 01:07:39,867
And all will worship your divine,
immeasurable beauty.

752
01:07:40,249 --> 01:07:42,036
I don't think so.

753
01:07:42,418 --> 01:07:44,626
Do not contradict me.

754
01:07:45,004 --> 01:07:48,964
Will if I want to. No way you can force me.
- Oh, yes, I can.

755
01:07:49,341 --> 01:07:52,834
Oh, you sound exactly
like my mother.

756
01:08:00,728 --> 01:08:03,266
You still have much to learn.

757
01:08:04,273 --> 01:08:08,438
Education is not really
my thing. So bye.

758
01:08:25,211 --> 01:08:27,248
This is mine?

759
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:39,798
Renfield is such a chatterbox.

760
01:08:48,901 --> 01:08:51,644
What a mattress!

761
01:09:28,107 --> 01:09:30,349
Why was I always so strict?

762
01:09:35,030 --> 01:09:37,738
<i>I'm a lazy boy
I watch the sun shine</i>

763
01:09:38,242 --> 01:09:41,110
<i>Lighting up
the peerless peaceful sea</i>

764
01:09:43,539 --> 01:09:44,746
More.

765
01:09:45,958 --> 01:09:47,745
Help!

766
01:09:48,460 --> 01:09:49,576
Melp?

767
01:09:50,004 --> 01:09:52,542
Meow.

768
01:09:52,923 --> 01:09:54,539
Dad.

769
01:09:59,889 --> 01:10:02,302
I think you might need

770
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:04,592
a little mirror time.

771
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:08,182
I, I, I can't...

772
01:10:08,397 --> 01:10:10,104
...I can't
be seen like...

773
01:10:10,524 --> 01:10:12,982
...this.

774
01:10:16,405 --> 01:10:18,897
<i>Beauty doesn't last.</i>

775
01:10:26,457 --> 01:10:29,746
Now that I've found you,
I will not let you go.

776
01:10:30,127 --> 01:10:32,835
I'm not going to let you take
over the world.

777
01:10:33,213 --> 01:10:36,832
You must come with me.
Who else will accept you...

778
01:10:37,217 --> 01:10:39,459
...looking like you do?

779
01:10:39,929 --> 01:10:42,296
<i>It doesn't matter what anyone
else thinks, Fay.</i>

780
01:10:43,474 --> 01:10:46,057
It doesn't matter what
I look like.

781
01:10:46,435 --> 01:10:49,143
It matters
who I am inside.

782
01:10:49,521 --> 01:10:51,854
If you will not come
with me willingly...

783
01:10:52,232 --> 01:10:54,189
...I will force you.

784
01:10:57,821 --> 01:10:58,857
Ow!

785
01:10:59,239 --> 01:11:01,856
Leave my sister alone.

786
01:11:04,286 --> 01:11:05,777
Die!

787
01:11:11,126 --> 01:11:13,743
Hm?

788
01:11:27,309 --> 01:11:30,768
Thanks for trying to save me.
That was really brave.

789
01:11:31,146 --> 01:11:35,481
You're welcome. And we really need to
talk about your choice of boyfriend.

790
01:11:38,112 --> 01:11:40,570
Uffta. Mash.

791
01:11:47,079 --> 01:11:49,617
Okay, he is way scarier
than I am.

792
01:11:59,591 --> 01:12:02,925
Mash! Immommebb.

793
01:12:44,136 --> 01:12:46,924
You know I only have cucumbers
in my bath!

794
01:12:47,306 --> 01:12:51,050
Although drowned bats are
a welcome addition.

795
01:12:57,316 --> 01:12:58,773
You!

796
01:12:59,151 --> 01:13:01,188
Be cool.

797
01:13:01,570 --> 01:13:04,153
She's on our side.
- What?

798
01:13:04,531 --> 01:13:09,322
True, it is.
- I've fallen for your lies far too many times.

799
01:13:09,703 --> 01:13:14,448
We can trust her. She brought
me here to you, didn't she?

800
01:13:14,792 --> 01:13:17,580
Well...
that's true.

801
01:13:17,961 --> 01:13:20,624
Dracula forced her to put
the spell on you.

802
01:13:21,006 --> 01:13:23,714
She was his prisoner.
- Dracula did that?

803
01:13:24,093 --> 01:13:28,133
Monster he is, who will stop at
nothing to get what he desires.

804
01:13:28,514 --> 01:13:32,508
I guess I didn't want to see
who he really was.

805
01:13:32,893 --> 01:13:36,011
Now I may never see
my family again.

806
01:13:38,565 --> 01:13:39,976
It's alright.

807
01:13:40,359 --> 01:13:43,568
For you, change that I could.

808
01:13:49,910 --> 01:13:52,197
Who knew dad had it in him?

809
01:13:52,579 --> 01:13:55,322
I guess he just
needed a holiday?

810
01:14:06,260 --> 01:14:10,004
Oh, I missed you so much.
Are you okay?

811
01:14:10,389 --> 01:14:12,972
Yes. Thanks to dad.

812
01:14:13,350 --> 01:14:15,592
You should have seen him
fight the giant beetle.

813
01:14:15,978 --> 01:14:19,016
You fought a monster?

814
01:14:19,398 --> 01:14:20,434
And won.

815
01:14:20,816 --> 01:14:24,480
What are we doing here?
- And what...

816
01:14:24,862 --> 01:14:28,606
...is she doing here?
- Here to help, I am.

817
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:32,575
She brought us
all together.

818
01:14:32,953 --> 01:14:34,865
Emma...

819
01:14:35,289 --> 01:14:38,123
...you mustn't
leave this castle.

820
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:40,617
So he can speak.
- Yeah.

821
01:14:41,003 --> 01:14:43,416
If you don't...

822
01:14:43,797 --> 01:14:47,711
...marry my master,
he will destroy the world.

823
01:14:48,093 --> 01:14:50,961
What?
- Talk about over-reacting.

824
01:14:51,346 --> 01:14:55,966
He plans to shoot a giant
ice sphere into the sun and then...

825
01:14:56,268 --> 01:14:58,055
...the sun
will be extinguished...

826
01:14:58,437 --> 01:15:01,100
...and all life on Earth
will come to an end.

827
01:15:01,481 --> 01:15:05,100
Except for vampires.
Who don't need sunlight.

828
01:15:05,736 --> 01:15:08,570
So in order to save
all life on Earth...

829
01:15:08,906 --> 01:15:11,068
...I have to marry Dracula?

830
01:15:11,450 --> 01:15:12,907
Mmm.

831
01:15:13,285 --> 01:15:16,619
No. We'll stop him.
- But how?

832
01:15:16,997 --> 01:15:20,536
My master is currently
in his Lazarus bath.

833
01:15:20,918 --> 01:15:23,251
He needs it to stop
himself from aging.

834
01:15:23,629 --> 01:15:26,542
Good to know but we're trying
to save the planet here.

835
01:15:26,924 --> 01:15:31,043
You misunderstand.
In the bath he's helpless.

836
01:15:31,428 --> 01:15:35,263
But he's only inside
until sunset.

837
01:15:35,641 --> 01:15:38,930
Okay, we've got no plan
and no time.

838
01:15:39,353 --> 01:15:42,562
Wait. Does this castle
have a kitchen?

839
01:15:42,940 --> 01:15:46,229
Only the best
in the catalogue.

840
01:15:49,029 --> 01:15:52,238
Okay. We need salt,
olive oil and water.

841
01:15:52,616 --> 01:15:56,735
We're making Dracula pasta?
- With salt, olive oil and sacred balm...

842
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:01,911
holy water, you make!
- Major anti-vampire mojo.

843
01:16:02,417 --> 01:16:05,581
Holy water will beat Dracula?
- For sure.

844
01:16:05,963 --> 01:16:08,797
Once he's beaten,
we'll lock him up forever.

845
01:16:09,633 --> 01:16:11,670
Salt and oil.

846
01:16:12,052 --> 01:16:14,385
And water.
- Er, Max.

847
01:16:14,763 --> 01:16:17,756
Where will we find sacred
balm in a kitchen?

848
01:16:18,141 --> 01:16:20,428
I don't think it's gonna
be in the spice rack.

849
01:16:20,811 --> 01:16:23,303
It's been here
all the time.

850
01:16:23,522 --> 01:16:26,811
Your bandages are steeped
in a sacred embalming fluid.

851
01:16:27,818 --> 01:16:30,185
Okay. Sometimes being smart...

852
01:16:30,570 --> 01:16:32,482
...is extremely cool.

853
01:16:42,457 --> 01:16:45,996
It's amazing what people will do
to knock off just a few years.

854
01:16:46,378 --> 01:16:48,711
I'm gonna jump on the tank and
I'll pour in the holy water.

855
01:16:51,133 --> 01:16:53,341
Awake, the Dark One is.

856
01:16:53,719 --> 01:16:57,258
Emma, why would you stay
with your wretched family...

857
01:16:57,639 --> 01:17:01,633
...when we can achieve
greatness together?

858
01:17:02,019 --> 01:17:05,228
Oh, no, I sense you
brought holy water.

859
01:17:05,605 --> 01:17:08,097
Wow, how can he smell
through that thing?

860
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:11,359
Your heart is so dark,
no-one could love you.

861
01:17:12,029 --> 01:17:14,942
Do be careful. It's very steep.

862
01:17:15,324 --> 01:17:17,361
- Ouch!
- Told you.

863
01:17:19,953 --> 01:17:23,117
This is from the Wishbones!

864
01:17:36,178 --> 01:17:40,388
For every antidote there
is an antiantidote.

865
01:17:42,768 --> 01:17:44,009
Bon appétit.

866
01:17:45,437 --> 01:17:46,928
And welcome back.

867
01:17:51,401 --> 01:17:52,812
I'm hungry!

868
01:17:55,947 --> 01:18:00,487
I'm sure your mother's love for you
is bigger than her appetite.

869
01:18:01,828 --> 01:18:03,319
Memma. Mon't.

870
01:18:04,748 --> 01:18:09,083
Now bite him and we shall live
together for all eternity.

871
01:18:10,045 --> 01:18:13,209
You are mine.
You are a vampire.

872
01:18:13,757 --> 01:18:15,965
Fulfil your destiny.

873
01:18:17,928 --> 01:18:19,294
I...

874
01:18:19,679 --> 01:18:22,342
...Immove... you.

875
01:18:24,184 --> 01:18:26,267
What are you doing?

876
01:18:29,564 --> 01:18:34,229
Yes, Emma. Do it!
Do it now!

877
01:18:36,405 --> 01:18:38,988
Emma?
No!

878
01:18:39,783 --> 01:18:41,775
No!

879
01:18:43,203 --> 01:18:44,660
Yes!

880
01:18:45,288 --> 01:18:48,872
The greatest magic,
love is.

881
01:18:50,210 --> 01:18:51,667
Yuck.

882
01:18:53,213 --> 01:18:54,670
What?

883
01:19:00,512 --> 01:19:02,925
Why does this always happen to me?

884
01:19:03,098 --> 01:19:05,306
You leave my mum alone.

885
01:19:09,813 --> 01:19:13,272
Ah, so much for romance.

886
01:19:13,650 --> 01:19:17,690
Humans, why must you
always be so... human?

887
01:19:32,294 --> 01:19:35,708
Is everyone okay?

888
01:19:36,965 --> 01:19:40,800
I'm so glad you're awake.
What I have in store for you is...

889
01:19:41,178 --> 01:19:43,921
...much more enjoyable
if you're conscious.

890
01:19:44,306 --> 01:19:47,640
The ice sphere is expanding.

891
01:19:48,518 --> 01:19:51,556
And soon we'll be
ready for launch.

892
01:19:51,938 --> 01:19:54,055
So I'm afraid it's
going to get very cramped...

893
01:19:54,441 --> 01:19:57,559
...and very, very
cold in here.

894
01:19:58,737 --> 01:20:02,321
Let my family go and
I will stay with you.

895
01:20:02,699 --> 01:20:04,816
It's too late,
I'm afraid...

896
01:20:05,202 --> 01:20:08,195
...Emma. You chose
your family over me.

897
01:20:08,580 --> 01:20:11,573
And now I choose
to destroy you.

898
01:20:11,958 --> 01:20:16,077
Just look at it as a
particularly bad break up.

899
01:20:27,432 --> 01:20:30,891
You and my traitorous servant
are about to discover what happens...

900
01:20:31,228 --> 01:20:35,563
...when you betray
the Prince of Darkness.

901
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:40,147
I've made a huge mistake and
I got us into this.

902
01:20:40,529 --> 01:20:41,986
You were right, Fay.

903
01:20:42,364 --> 01:20:44,822
I'm really good
at messing up.

904
01:20:45,033 --> 01:20:48,697
No, Mum, you were right.
- I was?

905
01:20:49,079 --> 01:20:52,322
It doesn't matter if people look at
me and see an ugly mummy.

906
01:20:52,707 --> 01:20:55,791
I know who I am under
all these bandages.

907
01:20:56,169 --> 01:20:58,377
And it's not that much
fun being scary.

908
01:20:58,755 --> 01:21:01,418
It's actually kind of lonely.
- I'm sorry...

909
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:04,087
...I said all those
awful things.

910
01:21:04,469 --> 01:21:08,133
I wouldn't want any other family.
- Frank...

911
01:21:08,515 --> 01:21:11,883
...mmove... family.

912
01:21:12,269 --> 01:21:14,556
I mmove you, too.

913
01:21:14,938 --> 01:21:17,055
Room for one more?

914
01:22:18,668 --> 01:22:23,129
You broke the spell!
You're finally happy.

915
01:22:23,506 --> 01:22:26,999
Come on, we have
to stop Dracula.

916
01:22:27,344 --> 01:22:30,052
We've just got this little
problem with the chains.

917
01:22:30,430 --> 01:22:32,296
I don't.

918
01:22:32,682 --> 01:22:34,924
And so you're going
to step up and single-handedly...

919
01:22:35,310 --> 01:22:37,472
...conquer the
Prince of Darkness...

920
01:22:37,854 --> 01:22:39,470
...and take us all home.
- What?

921
01:22:39,856 --> 01:22:42,815
You're the only one
who's not chained up.

922
01:22:47,739 --> 01:22:49,071
Hey.

923
01:22:54,245 --> 01:22:55,452
Hello.

924
01:22:58,458 --> 01:23:01,041
Wishbones, let's save the world then.

925
01:23:04,839 --> 01:23:07,001
The sun is
about to rise...

926
01:23:07,384 --> 01:23:11,128
...for the last time, because
very soon, my little friend...

927
01:23:11,513 --> 01:23:14,301
...your big brother will be
sent to destroy it!

928
01:23:18,228 --> 01:23:20,971
Not you again.
What are you doing here?

929
01:23:21,356 --> 01:23:23,689
You are meant to be frozen.

930
01:23:24,067 --> 01:23:27,231
In your dreams.
The Wishbones never give up.

931
01:23:27,612 --> 01:23:30,400
Such confidence.
Do tell me, my dear...

932
01:23:30,824 --> 01:23:34,113
...how do you plan to defeat
a being who can freeze you at will?

933
01:24:04,691 --> 01:24:07,183
Vile deceivers!

934
01:24:12,949 --> 01:24:15,157
I guess you're not
so powerful now.

935
01:24:15,410 --> 01:24:17,072
I can still press a button.

936
01:24:17,454 --> 01:24:19,741
Not so fast, you creep!

937
01:24:35,346 --> 01:24:38,760
Take that, and that,
and that, that and...

938
01:24:41,978 --> 01:24:44,686
Enough of this.

939
01:24:45,482 --> 01:24:47,189
What's he doing?

940
01:24:47,567 --> 01:24:49,980
Mrap. I mean crap!

941
01:24:50,361 --> 01:24:54,321
Pathetic creatures.
Look at you.

942
01:24:54,699 --> 01:24:58,113
Hideous. Weak. Timid.

943
01:24:58,495 --> 01:25:02,739
But we are a family.
Something that you will never have.

944
01:25:03,124 --> 01:25:05,161
And neither will you.

945
01:25:05,502 --> 01:25:07,118
What now?

946
01:25:07,504 --> 01:25:10,588
I beat a beetle.
- And won!

947
01:25:10,965 --> 01:25:13,673
I think I can
deal with that.

948
01:25:13,885 --> 01:25:16,628
Okay, let's settle
this man to bat.

949
01:25:33,363 --> 01:25:35,025
The sun.

950
01:25:39,410 --> 01:25:43,120
Did you really think
you could defeat me?

951
01:25:43,498 --> 01:25:45,740
Me?
The Prince of Darkness.

952
01:25:51,673 --> 01:25:55,542
The Scourge of Transylvania.
Say goodbye to your...

953
01:26:21,411 --> 01:26:23,528
Pitiful mortals.

954
01:26:30,503 --> 01:26:33,667
You cannot... defeat...

955
01:26:49,522 --> 01:26:51,684
Huh, Dracula.

956
01:26:54,152 --> 01:26:55,893
As I've always said

957
01:26:56,279 --> 01:26:59,693
it's good to do things
together as a family.

958
01:27:12,337 --> 01:27:16,206
More work for you, Wishbone.

959
01:27:16,591 --> 01:27:19,049
No can do.
I'm going home.

960
01:27:19,427 --> 01:27:23,137
I can fire you, you know.
You should think of your family.

961
01:27:23,514 --> 01:27:26,382
That's exactly what I'm doing.

962
01:27:27,518 --> 01:27:30,386
Wishbone! Wishbone!

963
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:35,353
<i>It might seem crazy what
I'm about to say</i>

964
01:27:38,446 --> 01:27:41,359
<i>Sunshine she's here,
you can take a break</i>

965
01:27:42,450 --> 01:27:44,783
<i>Because I'm happy</i>

966
01:27:45,036 --> 01:27:48,450
<i>Clap along if you feel
like a room without a roof</i>

967
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:50,781
<i>Because I'm happy</i>

968
01:27:51,042 --> 01:27:54,626
<i>Clap along if you feel
like happiness is the truth</i>

969
01:27:55,046 --> 01:27:56,787
<i>Because I'm happy</i>

970
01:27:57,048 --> 01:28:00,462
<i>Clap along if you know
what happiness is to you</i>

971
01:28:01,052 --> 01:28:02,793
<i>Because I'm happy</i>

972
01:28:03,054 --> 01:28:07,389
<i>Clap along if you feel
like that's what you wanna do</i>

973
01:28:08,476 --> 01:28:14,017
<i>Here comes bad news
talking this and that, yeah</i>

974
01:28:14,482 --> 01:28:18,396
<i>Well, give me all you got,
and don't hold it back</i>

975
01:28:23,950 --> 01:28:25,111
Da-da!
- Yeah!

976
01:28:26,494 --> 01:28:28,201
<i>Happy</i>

977
01:28:28,496 --> 01:28:32,410
<i>Only you
can make me happy</i>

978
01:28:36,504 --> 01:28:38,086
<i>Happy</i>

979
01:28:38,506 --> 01:28:43,422
<i>Only you
can make me happy</i>

980
01:28:45,513 --> 01:28:47,129
<i>So happy</i>

981
01:28:47,515 --> 01:28:48,881
Bye.

982
01:28:49,434 --> 01:28:52,427
<i>Only you
can make me happy</i>
