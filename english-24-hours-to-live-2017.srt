1
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:45,903
I remember the
first time I set foot in Africa.

2
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:48,484
Thought I'd hate if just
like Iraq, you know?

3
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:54,287
Figured, it's just more fucking
sand to kill each other over.

4
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:56,617
But I was wrong.

5
00:01:56,742 --> 00:02:00,622
It was the most beautiful
place I ever seen.

6
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,348
Took my fucking breath away.

7
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:17,805
Then I signed with Red
Mountain after my second tour.

8
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:20,812
You know they offered four
times what the Army paid?

9
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:23,314
Better equipment,
choose your deployments.

10
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,612
My family's piss-poor,

11
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,940
so I thought I hit the lottery.

12
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:31,152
You know? Get rich to
make the world safe?

13
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,529
Fuck, yeah.

14
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,913
Yeah, so much for that.

15
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,858
Hey, hey.

16
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,935
Get us out of here!

17
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,952
Oh, shit!

18
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:51,212
Go, back it up!
Get us out of here!

19
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:16,900
Fuck.

20
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,537
Aah!

21
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,922
Are you alive?

22
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,920
Yeah, I'm alive.

23
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:37,679
Fuck.

24
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:50,229
There you go.

25
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,356
I hope that's
not the bait knife.

26
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,613
The fish hate you, you know.

27
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,194
You think?

28
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,696
Yeah. Fish
like older men.

29
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:06,033
If you read more, you'd
know about these things.

30
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:10,667
And because they hate you,
we haven't caught anything.

31
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,540
Now, why is it they
hate me, exactly?

32
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:19,801
Animals in the natural world
are drawn to the souls of men.

33
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,223
They can see the light

34
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:23,175
that emits from inside us.

35
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:24,555
Well, is this a theory,

36
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,011
or something you read, or...?

37
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,222
Yeah, in a book in the library.

38
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:29,397
Library.

39
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,520
You've never been
to the fucking library.

40
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,898
It's called Shamanistic Spirit Animals.

41
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:35,236
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

42
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:38,566
My point is, you've got no soul.

43
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,822
And there's no light inside,
and they know that.

44
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:44,325
They see it.
They smell it.

45
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:47,248
But fish can't smell.

46
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:54,457
You are drunker than me, Frank.

47
00:06:56,791 --> 00:07:00,136
Are you ready to do this?

48
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,143
No.

49
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:23,281
I can't believe
it's been a year.

50
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,807
At least they're together.

51
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,894
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

52
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:56,648
- You know...
- What?

53
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:59,237
The shortest distance

54
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:03,112
between two points
is a straight line.

55
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,317
Yeah.

56
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,319
That's brilliant.

57
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,071
Why are we not doing it?

58
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,668
- We made it.
- Oh, shit.

59
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:24,546
We left the couch on the beach.

60
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,132
Where are you going to sleep?

61
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:30,719
I'll sleep on the floor.

62
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:34,519
That's because you're
such a hard ass.

63
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:40,021
No, it's because...
because I love your rug.

64
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:42,235
Want some water?

65
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:49,116
All rivers run into the sea

66
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:52,574
if the sea is not full.

67
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:59,005
Good night, Frank.

68
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,293
Where are you going?

69
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:06,763
I'm going to...
go for a walk.

70
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,341
Travis?

71
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:15,226
They loved you.

72
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,860
Don't forget that.

73
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,412
Thanks, man.

74
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,286
Do me a favor, don't
do it out here.

75
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,296
Wouldn't dream of it.

76
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,710
Hey, daddy.

77
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,885
You liking the girls tonight?

78
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,136
I don't go to strip clubs.

79
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,381
I got a wife and kid.

80
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:42,984
Hey! The door is jammed.

81
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:44,193
Somebody open the door!

82
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,109
Hold on a second.
Hold on, I got it, I got it.

83
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,610
Here, take this.

84
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,988
What the fuck?

85
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,409
Open this door!

86
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,790
Come on, open it!

87
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,338
Hold on, I got it.

88
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,877
All right, just give me a sec.

89
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,093
Come on, open it!

90
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,761
Open it!

91
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:14,512
I got it.
Hold on, hold on.

92
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,849
Here you are. Here you go.
Open up...

93
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,646
Can I help you guys?

94
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,447
We're Red Mountain!

95
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,570
We're supposed to find you.

96
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:32,658
Jim Morrow sent us.

97
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:35,157
I told Jim I'm on hiatus.

98
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,988
What the fuck?

99
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,539
It's some kind of emergency.

100
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:41,375
It's always an emergency
with you guys.

101
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:44,712
Jesus Christ.

102
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:08,520
Shake them titties.

103
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:15,198
You know, they
were my best guys.

104
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:21,374
I'm not impressed.

105
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,790
So, you don't call,

106
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,333
blow off my checks.

107
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,163
Uh-huh.

108
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,965
You know, I feel like a
prom date the day after.

109
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:32,131
Well, I told you, I'm
on hiatus, you know?

110
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,254
I know. I know.

111
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:36,840
So, what do you want?

112
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:39,767
I want you to have a drink.

113
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:40,680
Hmm?

114
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,310
Try a peanut.
They're great.

115
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:49,982
I want you to put a pin in your
vacation for a couple days.

116
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,655
I need you to kill
somebody for us.

117
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:53,648
Mm-hmm.

118
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:54,695
You do that for me,

119
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,368
zip back here and
resume your reflection.

120
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:00,572
Just call me on Monday
when I'm back, huh?

121
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:02,623
It can't wait till Monday.

122
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,285
Then get somebody else.

123
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:07,704
You really need me
to say it, huh?

124
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,210
You want to hear it?
Okay.

125
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:14,011
Red don't want nobody else.
They want you.

126
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,925
They want the best.

127
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:16,846
How about that?

128
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:19,136
Still tough shit. I
don't work for anybody.

129
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:21,180
I'm an independent contractor.

130
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,803
- Yeah.
- Like you used to be.

131
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:28,024
Yeah, they're well aware
of your free agency.

132
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,314
Well...

133
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,355
thank you for the drinks.

134
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,572
I'm leaving.

135
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:36,820
You want to hear me out?

136
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:40,616
No, I don't.
Say hi to Jasmin.

137
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:45,826
Wetzler's offering
a million a day.

138
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:51,290
One million.

139
00:13:56,461 --> 00:14:00,216
That is a suspiciously
high number, even for him.

140
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,217
Yeah, well,

141
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,310
the job comes with a mop.

142
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,638
Somebody else fucked it up.

143
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:09,520
How high are you
authorized to go?

144
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,562
One point five.

145
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:14,028
Wow. And you take
your usual cut.

146
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:14,941
You know what?

147
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,695
I don't do this for
laughs no more, buddy.

148
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:20,034
Oh, shit.

149
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,705
You get that offer
doubled and I'm in.

150
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,373
There you go.

151
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,879
There he is.

152
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,421
There's your target.

153
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:40,046
His name's Keith Zera.
He's 26 years old.

154
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:41,844
He's one of their own?

155
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:43,220
Mm, he was.

156
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:47,805
He's now scheduled to testify on
camera for a U.N. investigation.

157
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,935
- Against Red Mountain?
- Mm-hmm.

158
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:50,852
For what?

159
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:53,526
See, I just got you two
million reasons a day

160
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,229
why the answer to that
question doesn't matter.

161
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:58,948
Now here's what matters.

162
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:03,070
Yesterday while in transit
across the Namibian border,

163
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:04,537
an attempt was made on his life.

164
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:08,242
And now Interpol, they've
hidden him off grid.

165
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:12,041
They're sending somebody to take
his deposition in the field,

166
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,418
but the location's unknown.

167
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:16,416
When's that going to happen?

168
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,758
Sometime Friday afternoon.

169
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:22,005
So I got 72 hours to find this
whistle blowing do-gooder

170
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,807
somewhere in Africa,
and terminate him.

171
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,097
- There you go.
- What went wrong the first time?

172
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:28,811
Red Mountain used local militia,

173
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,807
tried to make it look like
a kidnapping gone wrong.

174
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,434
- Numb nuts.
- Fucking stupid.

175
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:35,651
You see,

176
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:41,446
they underestimated one element
of his protection team.

177
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,576
Her name's Lin Bisset.

178
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:47,747
Now, she's the last
person seen with him...

179
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:53,079
and the reason
he's still breathing.

180
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:55,084
Interpol, huh?

181
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:56,210
Huh.

182
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,291
Mother of one?

183
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,135
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

184
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:02,504
I don't worry about that part.

185
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,801
It's starting to feel
kind of ugly, Jim.

186
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:08,301
Yeah, well, they're all ugly.

187
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:11,225
$25 billion corporation
involved.

188
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:15,684
Half the U.S. Senate is
beholden to Red Mountain.

189
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,482
I know. I know. I know.

190
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,572
It's bullshit.

191
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,651
But they want him taken out.

192
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,198
Keep reading, pal.

193
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:33,327
We're wheels up in 10.

194
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,046
How did you do it?

195
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:43,169
I fell at' work.

196
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:45,171
You know how clumsy I can be.

197
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:47,594
Are you minding
your grandmother?

198
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,970
Not really.

199
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,519
Christopher.

200
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,558
When are you coming home, Mom?

201
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,273
Tomorrow night.
I promise.

202
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,522
Okay. I can't wait
to see you.

203
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,976
- Yes?
- Hi.

204
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,732
I'm sorry to bother you
so early in the morning.

205
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,570
I'm not even sure if I
have the right address.

206
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,941
I'm looking for an old
friend, Lin Bisset.

207
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,818
We spent a semester abroad
together at Oxford.

208
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,323
Uh, yes.

209
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,451
That's my daughter.
What's your name, sir?

210
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:55,500
My name is Dennis Merrick.
I'm from the States.

211
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,669
Is she here? Could I--
Could I speak to her?

212
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,041
Unfortunately, no.
But if you like,

213
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:01,338
I can tell her you came by.

214
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:02,882
All right, I appreciate that.

215
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,668
Dennis Merrick, okay?
From Oxford?

216
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,253
- Okay.
- Okay.

217
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:07,844
Um...

218
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,639
actually, if it's not
too much of a bother,

219
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,600
I was really excited about
the chance to surprise her.

220
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:16,392
And do you know
where she might be?

221
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,596
How I could find her?

222
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:19,349
She's flying home tonight.

223
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:20,775
Is that Lin's son?

224
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,518
We Skyped last night.

225
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:23,569
She hurt her hand,

226
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,021
so she's coming home early.

227
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,072
Who are you, anyway?

228
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:28,741
I'm Dennis Merrick.

229
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:29,567
From Virginia.

230
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,902
Old friend of your mom's.

231
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:33,158
Never heard of you before.

232
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,155
Christopher!

233
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,327
It's all right.

234
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:36,532
He's just watching
his mother's back.

235
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:40,086
I respect that. I got a son
about the same age as you.

236
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:43,256
What are you, 10 and a half?

237
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:44,924
Yeah.

238
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:46,717
What is that?

239
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,339
Is that a Wolverine bag?

240
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:49,462
Can I--
Can I see that?

241
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:52,306
See, I went to the store today

242
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,928
to get one of these for my son,

243
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:56,102
but all they had was the Hulk.

244
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,846
So I didn't get one.
I don't know why...

245
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,814
Because the Hulk sucks.

246
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:01,898
Yeah.

247
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,692
That's right.
Because the Hulk sucks.

248
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:05,566
All right, listen, you
two, thank you so much.

249
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:08,774
And, you know, I hope we get
to meet again sometime.

250
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,483
Bye-bye.

251
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,534
Identification.

252
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:16,702
Yeah, Yankees suck.

253
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,792
What can / do for you,
Mr. Conrad?

254
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,244
Yeah, I need
the passenger manifests

255
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:24,672
for every flight departing
from Cape Town, South Africa,

256
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:28,510
inbound for Hong Kong
in the next 30 hours.

257
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,963
Hey, you guys know
an 11-letter word

258
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,014
for "traveling saint"?

259
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:16,932
I don't know.

260
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,098
No idea? You didn't
go to Sunday school, huh?

261
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,812
All right.

262
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,979
Thanks, guys.

263
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,147
Safe travels.

264
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,897
Hey, you know an 11-letter
word for "traveling saint"?

265
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,519
Sorry.

266
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,445
Nothing, huh?
I knew it.

267
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:31,405
Excuse me, do...

268
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:34,696
forgive me, but do you
know an 11-letter word

269
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,528
for "traveling saint"?

270
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,871
I do a lot of traveling
for work internationally.

271
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,298
I'm trying to learn
a little bit as I go.

272
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:52,385
Obviously I need to learn more.

273
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:57,431
You have a nice flight, too.

274
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:18,445
I'm going to need another beer.

275
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,665
Here you go.

276
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:28,504
Thank you.

277
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,794
- No, no, no. Fuck off, man.
- What'd you say?

278
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:34,840
I said that's
my girlfriend's seat.

279
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,305
Christopher.

280
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,269
I'm sorry.

281
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:49,601
St. Christopher.

282
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:52,687
Eleven letters.

283
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:55,990
Nicely done.
Thank you.

284
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:58,484
My son's name.

285
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,988
Really? Huh.

286
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:05,583
What happened?
You miss your flight?

287
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:06,659
Canceled.

288
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:09,128
1:00 p.m. tomorrow.

289
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:10,705
Oh, damn.

290
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,423
I thought I had it bad.

291
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:15,001
Got about 6 1/2 hours to kill.

292
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:18,504
I know a much better
restaurant than this.

293
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:22,008
Can I take you out to dinner?

294
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:27,684
All right.

295
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:30,024
Let's settle up here.

296
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,151
What happened to your hand?

297
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:39,192
A work accident.

298
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:40,693
A work accident?

299
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:42,616
That sounds suspicious.

300
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:47,747
What do you do?

301
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,752
I think I'm starting
to like you,

302
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,918
so I don't want to answer that.

303
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,416
So you're a stripper.

304
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,464
No.

305
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:58,385
No, no.

306
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:01,426
Let's just say that, um...

307
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:04,596
my company tries to convince
people to buy things

308
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:08,563
by persuading them they
can't live without them.

309
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:13,272
And is that what you're
doing right now?

310
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:16,191
Trying to convince me to buy?

311
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,439
I don't think of myself
as a product,

312
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:22,410
and I certainly don't think
of you as a customer.

313
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:31,919
Don't you have
someone back home?

314
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,753
I did.

315
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:42,255
I lost my wife and son
a year ago this week.

316
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,455
Hey, Jim.

317
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,578
Yeah, I got the target location.

318
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,125
Hey, salesman!

319
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,420
Uh...

320
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,760
let me call you back.

321
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:28,929
I was just leaving
you a message.

322
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:30,218
Shut up!
On your knees.

323
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:31,799
All right, Lin,
put the gun down.

324
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:33,597
- Everything's all right--
- Knees! Now!

325
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:36,266
- Now!
- All right--yes, yes, yes!

326
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:29,982
I miss you, Daddy.

327
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:33,660
When are you coming home?

328
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:07,353
You're welcome, asshole.

329
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,023
Love you, pal.

330
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,151
I'm sorry.

331
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,737
We have a heartbeat.

332
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:22,205
Help me!

333
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:26,422
What's his name?

334
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,583
Do you want him back or not?

335
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,339
What's his fucking name?

336
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:32,135
Travis.

337
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:35,090
Travis. Travis.

338
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:39,302
My name is Helen.
I'm a doctor.

339
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:44,394
Just follow the
sound of my voice.

340
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:47,226
Just stay here with me.

341
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:49,399
It's all going to be okay.

342
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:50,645
His pulse is stabilizing.

343
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,902
Just stay here with me, Travis.

344
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:53,865
There we go.

345
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:56,364
You're doing well.

346
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,410
Hey, man.

347
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:11,925
What the hell's going on, huh?

348
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:16,301
The Interpol agent...

349
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,600
she shot you.

350
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:22,640
Do you remember?

351
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:24,896
She killed you.

352
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:28,943
And we just brought you back
from the abyss, my friend.

353
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:31,653
That's impossible.

354
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,443
Well, it's not, actually.

355
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:38,694
Red Mountain, they've been
developing this procedure

356
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,030
for years now.

357
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:42,740
And you wouldn't believe

358
00:29:42,823 --> 00:29:45,292
what they've done
to make this work.

359
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:49,289
Truth is, some of it's
pretty fucked up,

360
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:51,757
and...

361
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,257
...it's classified.

362
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:58,464
What do you mean
it's classified?

363
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:00,010
How come you didn't tell me?

364
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:02,806
Top clearance, Travis.

365
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:05,186
Or, quite simply,

366
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:09,480
because you hadn't
been killed yet.

367
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:13,274
Moments prior to your
death, you made a call

368
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:15,606
stating that you knew the
location of the safe house

369
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:19,569
where Keith Zera is
making his deposition.

370
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:22,871
Do you remember the location?

371
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:31,456
We've less than two hours

372
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:33,757
before he makes his deposition.

373
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,676
This information is vital.

374
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:40,840
1220 Longmarket, Room 102.

375
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,434
You're certain of that?

376
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,315
Yeah.

377
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,391
Good.

378
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:55,146
This fucking procedure
is finally paying off.

379
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:57,105
This is on you.
Kill Zera.

380
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:58,486
- Personally.
- Personally?

381
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:00,112
I'm sorry, is that a problem?

382
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:02,661
I'm a handler now, sir.

383
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:05,034
No more wet work.

384
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:06,452
I gave my word.

385
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,783
To whom?
Your wife?

386
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,334
Jim, this is the
moment, you realize,

387
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:12,413
that the unseen line between
friendship and profession

388
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:15,916
is not where you thought it was.

389
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:19,003
And because Conrad went soft

390
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:20,679
and let the Interpol agent live,

391
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:24,384
you'll take care of her as well.

392
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,727
Yes, sir.

393
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:34,352
Now, this is it, Travis.

394
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:37,904
You're one hell of a weapon.

395
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:43,535
Godspeed.

396
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:59,464
Hey, Jim, get me off this thing.

397
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:04,552
I can't do that.

398
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:08,177
What do you mean?

399
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:12,606
This was always
going to be a patch job.

400
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:16,564
You're never going
to leave this box.

401
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:26,494
I'm going to get
the doc in here.

402
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:32,915
Give you something
to make it go quick.

403
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:43,922
We've done some
fucked-up things.

404
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:50,470
This is how it ends, buddy.

405
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:58,644
I'm sorry.

406
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:09,572
Jim? Jim?

407
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:11,827
Jim!

408
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:44,447
Hydromorphone.

409
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:46,901
It's a very powerful narcotic.

410
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:50,325
I know what it is.

411
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:55,371
It's such a waste.

412
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:58,044
I'm sorry.

413
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:19,520
What is happening to me?

414
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,476
You're going to die.
Again.

415
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,779
- How do I stop it?
- You can't.

416
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:26,444
- Who knows more than you?
- No one!

417
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:27,942
I designed the procedure.

418
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,068
Your body will reject
the drug cocktail.

419
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:32,366
Your mental faculties
will break down.

420
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:35,824
Even if you survive that,
which no one ever has,

421
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,409
there's a built-in
fail safe.

422
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:40,037
- The Lazarus unit.
- How long do I have?

423
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,373
How long do I have?!

424
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,134
You have less than
24 hours to live.

425
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,943
Secure the perimeter!

426
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,975
All right, come on,
move, move, move.

427
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:53,827
What are you doing here?

428
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:57,452
You're not supposed to be here.

429
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:04,580
Adam...

430
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:10,010
What's happening to me?

431
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:13,676
You're hallucinating.

432
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:17,805
It's a side effect of the drugs.

433
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,811
I'd run if I were you.

434
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:21,809
I made the mistake

435
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:25,734
of not killing a woman
once already today.

436
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:31,319
Don't make me regret this.

437
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:49,044
I'm sorry.

438
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,181
Travis, you disappeared on me.

439
00:36:57,257 --> 00:37:00,557
Believe me, you have no idea

440
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,433
how much I wish I was there.

441
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:05,015
Well, where are you?

442
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:10,729
I'm in South Africa.

443
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:12,856
Jesus.

444
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:15,696
I'm not coming back, okay?

445
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,573
Not, uh...

446
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:19,325
not ever.

447
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:21,532
What?
What's wrong?

448
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:23,332
I'm in a bad way, Frank.

449
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:24,751
Bad like what?

450
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:26,336
Well...

451
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:28,209
oh, um...

452
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:29,915
let's say bad as it gets.

453
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:33,418
It all caught up with me, pal.

454
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,755
You were right.

455
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:40,760
I don't think I do have a soul.

456
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:42,385
Probably never did.

457
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:47,066
You were such
a great father-in-law.

458
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,767
You really were.

459
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:54,865
I wasn't there for them.

460
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,361
No excuses.

461
00:37:56,441 --> 00:38:02,289
Travis, you meant everything
to Kate and Adam.

462
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:05,166
Don't give up.

463
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,900
Hey, taxi.

464
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:31,897
Taxi!

465
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,193
Give me that cell phone.

466
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:36,064
All right, now give me the keys.

467
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,149
Give me the keys.

468
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,373
We'd been working security
on a crude pipeline

469
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:52,589
stretching from interior Congo
to the coast.

470
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,629
And one day we got a
call for reassignment.

471
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:02,932
By "we," you
mean who specifically?

472
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:05,180
Rapid-deploy unit.

473
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:07,724
Red Mountain's top crew.

474
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:09,223
We'd been...

475
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,896
we'd been all over.

476
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:16,446
So our orders were to be
in Namibia by next morning.

477
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:18,657
So tell me about the
events of that morning,

478
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:20,825
June the 7th last year.

479
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:24,328
We traveled through the night.

480
00:39:24,404 --> 00:39:26,827
Fifty kilometers
northwest of the border.

481
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:29,910
It was real remote bush,
you know?

482
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:34,130
Typically, we'd take in two SU\/s
or maybe even a Blackhawk,

483
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,754
so I was surprised
when I was told

484
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,377
to bring up heavy equipment.

485
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:41,721
What kind of equipment?

486
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:46,559
Two loaders, a dozer,
and a dump truck.

487
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:50,848
They took us out to
a remote container yard.

488
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:55,026
And what
was inside, Mr. Zera?

489
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:00,569
Bodies.

490
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,739
Everywhere. The place
was packed with them.

491
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:06,613
Militia bodies?

492
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:10,867
Civilian.

493
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,794
Men, women, and kids.

494
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:17,507
Was there indication
of how they died?

495
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:20,552
No. Not' at' first'.

496
00:40:20,627 --> 00:40:22,971
At least not to us-

497
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:25,386
And then, yeah,
we started noticing

498
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:27,433
that each one had scars
0/7 their chests

499
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,348
and on their wrists.

500
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:32,313
Turns out they'd been medically
fucking experimented on.

501
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:36,776
And how many bodies
would you say?

502
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:38,520
I'd say at least 70.

503
00:40:39,354 --> 00:40:41,106
By that night, we'd dug a pit

504
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,903
half the size
of a football field,

505
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:45,235
and we burned and buried them.

506
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:48,447
Each one.
All 70.

507
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:52,451
All into a single mass grave?

508
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:58,298
Yeah.

509
00:40:58,373 --> 00:40:59,966
Which was when they reminded us

510
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:01,710
about our confidentiality
agreements,

511
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:04,012
and told us that
we'd each be getting

512
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:08,429
a $50,000 danger pay bonus.

513
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:12,346
You know, I took
two tours of Iraq,

514
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:16,020
so, yeah, I've seen some shit.

515
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,392
But I...

516
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:21,321
I never signed up to burn a dump
truck full of dead civilians.

517
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:23,860
And that is something
I will never,

518
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:27,577
ever get out of my head
as long as I live.

519
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:32,791
How long have
you worked for Red Mountain?

520
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:40,340
Get down!

521
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:45,170
Move! Move! Move!

522
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:47,717
Shit!

523
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,643
Stay down!

524
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:10,658
- Go! Now!
- Move!

525
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:13,456
All right, move in.
Take them out.

526
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,329
Roger that.

527
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:17,293
- This way. Hug the walls.
- Move, move move!

528
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,666
Get to that door!

529
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,422
Get down!

530
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:32,892
Let's go.

531
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:38,022
Come on.

532
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,798
Get up.

533
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:30,783
Get in the car.

534
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,278
I should have killed you
when I had the chance.

535
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:34,528
Drive!

536
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:39,118
Well, look who it is.
The $2 million man.

537
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:42,541
Do not ever point
a gun at me again.

538
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,213
Drive.

539
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:46,837
All right, all right. Hold your horses.
Here we go.

540
00:43:55,091 --> 00:43:57,344
You seem to be
a pretty popular man.

541
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:58,393
What do you have
on Red Mountain?

542
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,267
- That's classified.
- I don't give a shit.

543
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:01,768
What do you have on them?

544
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:04,021
I got enough to bring the
whole fucking thing down.

545
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,147
Who the fuck are you?

546
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:07,194
I'm your assassin. If you don't
stop pointing that gun at me.

547
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:10,235
- I'll point the fucking gun--
- Hey, calm down!

548
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,367
Oh, shit.

549
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:19,665
Oh, shit!

550
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:24,917
Goddamn, what the hell do
you have on these guys?

551
00:44:28,124 --> 00:44:31,003
- Get down!
- Oh, shit.

552
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:36,886
Wake the fuck up!

553
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:40,012
Oh, shit!

554
00:44:42,722 --> 00:44:44,474
Oh, shit.

555
00:44:57,195 --> 00:44:59,163
You're going to kill us all.

556
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:00,865
You'd be dead already
if it wasn't for me.

557
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:03,960
You just said you were here
to kill the man I'm protecting.

558
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:05,537
So forgive me
if I don't trust you.

559
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:07,004
Trust you?

560
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,001
You just shot me.

561
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,550
Would you two just get
your fucking shit together?

562
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:49,122
Are you okay?

563
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:50,624
Am I okay?

564
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:52,333
Yeah, a shot of morphine,
a couple stitches,

565
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,544
I'm fucking golden.

566
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:58,882
Well, don't go to the
same doctor I did.

567
00:46:04,053 --> 00:46:06,055
Oh, shit.

568
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:22,406
Roll out.

569
00:46:47,138 --> 00:46:49,687
Let me see, all right?

570
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:08,459
I don't want to go like this.

571
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:19,295
I'm sorry.

572
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:30,477
See you in 16 hours.

573
00:47:57,124 --> 00:48:00,048
I'm good. I'm good.

574
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:09,687
Where's the card?

575
00:48:09,762 --> 00:48:11,480
The card?
Sure.

576
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:15,685
Fucking memory
card, where is it?

577
00:48:15,768 --> 00:48:16,815
I have no idea.

578
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:18,066
"I have no idea," huh?

579
00:48:18,187 --> 00:48:21,157
You didn't look,
you didn't check.

580
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:21,903
No.

581
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:23,697
Our orders were very clear, sir.

582
00:48:23,776 --> 00:48:27,406
Neutralize the target,
recover the cam--

583
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:31,500
Get the fuck out of here.

584
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:33,077
Go.

585
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:41,043
Sir?

586
00:48:41,127 --> 00:48:43,596
Status?

587
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:46,473
Incomplete.

588
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:49,469
This is your third
major fuck-up.

589
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:54,440
I don't care what you have to
do or who you have to kill,

590
00:48:54,557 --> 00:48:55,729
finish it.

591
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:57,227
I've spent over
a billion dollars

592
00:48:57,309 --> 00:49:00,062
on this procedure to change
the face of warfare-

593
00:49:00,146 --> 00:49:01,363
- I get it.
- Do you?

594
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:05,069
Do you realize
what's on the line here...

595
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:09,281
for me, for you,

596
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:11,624
for your family?

597
00:49:13,993 --> 00:49:15,336
Sir.

598
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:30,634
Give me a secure line.

599
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:32,853
Identification?

600
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,267
Red Sox suck.

601
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:38,146
What can I do for you,
Mr. Morrow?

602
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:42,647
Green-light Hong Kong.

603
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:45,817
Now.

604
00:49:57,203 --> 00:49:59,171
When they find out you
have that deposition,

605
00:49:59,288 --> 00:50:02,542
they're going to come at you
with everything they've got.

606
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:03,877
He tried to do the right thing.

607
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:07,175
Yeah, well they should
chisel that on his grave.

608
00:50:07,296 --> 00:50:11,597
- Now what?
- Take this car.

609
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:13,594
Go home. Go back to your life.

610
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:17,432
Send somebody back
for the bodies.

611
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:21,019
What do you mean, bodies?

612
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:26,529
I've only got 16 hours and
4 minutes left to live.

613
00:50:27,066 --> 00:50:29,615
That's my personal
"on and off" switch,

614
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:31,787
compliments of Red Mountain.

615
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:34,490
This is as far as I go.

616
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:36,701
It's a fucked-up
outfit, Lin.

617
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:41,001
Somebody's got to do
something about it.

618
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:44,003
Just not me.

619
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:51,511
Hello?

620
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:54,935
Can I speak to Travis, please?

621
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:58,556
It's someone for you.

622
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:04,270
- Hello?
- There he is.

623
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:07,774
My friend, the dead guy.

624
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,118
You have no idea.

625
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:13,704
And Zera?

626
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:15,448
He's even deader.

627
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:18,747
Congratulations, pal.
You're wet again.

628
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:21,416
We've got her kid, Travis.

629
00:51:21,537 --> 00:51:24,416
If she wants to see him again...

630
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:28,093
you'll bring me the card.

631
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:29,553
That's all I want.

632
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:31,255
Come on, you know
how this works.

633
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:34,008
You know what's on
that deposition, hmm?

634
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:36,435
Just tell her to bring it in.

635
00:51:36,552 --> 00:51:38,179
You're a real charmer, pal.

636
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:42,563
You got any more secrets
for me, old friend?

637
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:05,957
Red Mountain...

638
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:08,584
they've taken Christopher...

639
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:11,345
in exchange for the deposition.

640
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,641
Lin.

641
00:52:18,761 --> 00:52:19,978
Christopher.

642
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,893
Listen to me.

643
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:25,693
I'm going to help you
get your son back.

644
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:28,187
I promise.

645
00:52:29,605 --> 00:52:31,482
I promise.

646
00:52:35,611 --> 00:52:38,410
You know, he's already
on their jet flying here.

647
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:42,619
They're going to bring him
to their corporate headquarters.

648
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:45,587
Okay, I know the route
their escort vehicle takes,

649
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:47,877
so we'll hit them before
they ever get downtown.

650
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:49,921
How do you know so much?

651
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,799
I know all their
abduction protocols.

652
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:54,004
How?

653
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:57,303
Because I've used them.

654
00:53:22,366 --> 00:53:24,539
Adam?

655
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:29,214
Come with me, Dad.

656
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:32,001
Come with me, Dad.

657
00:53:38,674 --> 00:53:39,675
I miss you, Daddy.

658
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:41,305
I miss you too, buddy.

659
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:42,762
Are you going to stay this time?

660
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:44,433
Roscoe, Mike, let's go.

661
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:45,807
- Jones! Conrad!
- I promise.

662
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:47,607
I'll be back to
stay this time, I promise.

663
00:53:47,725 --> 00:53:49,193
All right? Listen, I got to go.

664
00:53:49,268 --> 00:53:50,895
Do you think you can put
Mommy on the phone?

665
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:53,772
You can't keep
doing that, Travis-.

666
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:55,524
Making promises you don't keep.

667
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:57,575
I'm making more
money this week...

668
00:53:57,693 --> 00:54:01,914
We don't need the money.
We need you.

669
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:05,534
Now you're not home
because of this company.

670
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:07,540
Kate, please, I can't keep
having this conversation.

671
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:10,168
- All right? Please?
- Travis, let's go!

672
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:11,624
Travis!

673
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:35,905
Fuck.

674
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,283
Let's go.

675
00:54:38,776 --> 00:54:40,995
What's happening?

676
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:45,158
I'm fine. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

677
00:54:55,334 --> 00:54:56,631
Where are you going?

678
00:54:56,752 --> 00:54:59,801
You don't want
to open that door.

679
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:32,463
You know, I know the team
that's bringing in your son.

680
00:55:32,538 --> 00:55:33,960
They're very good.

681
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:37,794
We're going to have
to get creative.

682
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:51,477
Your wife and son?

683
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:57,021
Yes.

684
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:17,758
All right, I've got
somebody we need to go see.

685
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:46,074
Travis Conrad. At
4:00 in the morning.

686
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:48,071
What can I say?
I missed you, pal.

687
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:51,291
Yeah, I wish I could
say the same.

688
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:53,706
Who's your friend?

689
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:57,335
Amahle, Lin.
Lin, Amahle.

690
00:56:57,414 --> 00:57:00,418
We met in '94,
back in happier times.

691
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:03,261
Yes, when we were
both real soldiers.

692
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:05,551
You know, we call
him Travis the Cat,

693
00:57:05,714 --> 00:57:08,763
because he has nine lives,
he always lands on his feet,

694
00:57:08,884 --> 00:57:11,012
and licks his balls.

695
00:57:17,309 --> 00:57:23,066
And now this stray has
wandered into my home

696
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:25,571
at this time.

697
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:27,698
For what?

698
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:34,414
What do you know
about Red Mountain?

699
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:36,999
They provide a lot
of assistance here.

700
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:41,091
Money for sanitation,
training, youth programming.

701
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:42,839
Over the past two years,

702
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,429
hundreds of refugees
have gone missing.

703
00:57:46,672 --> 00:57:48,140
My sister, please.

704
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:50,554
Tell me something I don't know.

705
00:57:50,634 --> 00:57:53,228
They were abducted and
murdered by Red Mountain.

706
00:57:53,345 --> 00:57:55,689
Used for experimental
medical procedures.

707
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:57,729
Real Mengele-type shit,
you know?

708
00:57:57,808 --> 00:58:00,982
Human beings used as lab rats.

709
00:58:02,354 --> 00:58:06,404
You know there are a lot
of people in this township,

710
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,235
people that work for me,

711
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:11,663
whose families
have gone missing.

712
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:21,920
Come, let's go for a drive.

713
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:31,137
You're late. Call it in.

714
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:34,390
All right, the rest
of you, let's hustle.

715
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:38,265
Base, this is Retrieval
team leader.

716
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:41,898
We're en route on November
two, approaching Mews Way.

717
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:46,900
We've got what looks like
a car fire on the main road.

718
00:58:46,982 --> 00:58:48,199
Requesting permission
to reroute.

719
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:50,159
Permission granted.

720
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:53,455
Just get your passenger
f0 base ASAP.

721
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:56,579
Units 2 and 3, we're taking
a detour around this mess.

722
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:44,206
Is that Travis Conrad?

723
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:45,211
Fuck, man.

724
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:49,591
Units 2 and 3, dismount,
but let me handle this.

725
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:57,553
Hey, man,
what's your name again?

726
00:59:57,636 --> 00:59:58,762
You can call me Z.

727
00:59:58,887 --> 01:00:01,106
That's right, Z.
How are you?

728
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:01,940
Can't complain, Travis.

729
01:00:02,057 --> 01:00:05,357
- How are you?
- I've been better.

730
01:00:05,477 --> 01:00:08,606
I got $318,000 in this bag
here I'd like to give you

731
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:10,073
in exchange for your passenger.

732
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:11,741
Well, that's a very
generous offer,

733
01:00:11,817 --> 01:00:14,161
but you know I can't
do that, right?

734
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:16,871
Yeah? It's worth
your life to you?

735
01:00:16,947 --> 01:00:18,415
What you going to do?

736
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:21,619
I got you outgunned 12 to 1.

737
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:35,340
You see all these people?

738
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:38,469
These are the families
and the friends

739
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:43,224
of those villagers who you
guys somehow made disappear.

740
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:44,979
Hey, I had nothing
to do with that shit.

741
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:46,401
Yeah, well, I don't
think they give a fuck.

742
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:48,194
Well, maybe you do give
a fuck, all right?

743
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:50,689
You don't remember me,
but I served under you.

744
01:00:50,814 --> 01:00:51,906
Musizi Bridge, Congo.

745
01:00:51,982 --> 01:00:53,199
I know how you roll, man.

746
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:55,284
It doesn't have to
go down like that.

747
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,577
What's your name again?

748
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,030
- Z.
- No, your real name.

749
01:00:58,155 --> 01:00:59,623
- What's your name?
- Zack.

750
01:00:59,698 --> 01:01:01,041
All right, Zachary,
listen to me.

751
01:01:01,158 --> 01:01:05,459
I wasted my whole life
learning how to hurt people.

752
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,497
I kill people for money,
just like you.

753
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:09,340
And you know what it got me?

754
01:01:09,457 --> 01:01:10,674
Nothing.

755
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:13,671
It took my wife, it took my son.

756
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:16,048
It took everything,
you understand?

757
01:01:16,173 --> 01:01:18,471
So I got a lot of work to do...

758
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:20,894
before I forgive myself,
all right?

759
01:01:21,011 --> 01:01:22,979
So I'm leaving here
with that boy.

760
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:25,227
And you can either walk
away with a bag of money,

761
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:28,852
or I'm going to walk away
over your dead body.

762
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:16,908
Christopher!

763
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:29,379
Christopher!

764
01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:38,926
Stop!

765
01:02:53,812 --> 01:02:56,065
No!

766
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:16,669
Come on, let's go!
Let's go!

767
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:18,386
Shit.
Let's go!

768
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:21,010
- He's in the other vehicle.
- How do you know?

769
01:03:21,131 --> 01:03:24,010
Because the passenger never
rides in the rear vehicle.

770
01:03:24,134 --> 01:03:26,637
Never.
It's protocol.

771
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:41,826
Out of the way!
Out of the way!

772
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:50,832
Faster!
We can't lose them.

773
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:52,795
Shit.

774
01:03:58,168 --> 01:03:59,966
There they are.

775
01:04:18,146 --> 01:04:20,023
Just trust me, all right?

776
01:04:37,332 --> 01:04:39,460
- Christopher!
- Mom, is that you?

777
01:04:41,753 --> 01:04:45,223
I can't see.
Take this thing off.

778
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:19,299
How have you been?

779
01:05:21,126 --> 01:05:22,252
Oh, I love you so much.

780
01:05:22,377 --> 01:05:24,971
Get out of here.
Go, go, go, go, go.

781
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:33,350
I can't do this alone, Travis.

782
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:34,898
Kate, listen to me.

783
01:05:34,973 --> 01:05:37,692
I talked to them.
This is the last time.

784
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:41,863
The next time I come
home, it's for good.

785
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:44,157
I promise.

786
01:05:47,318 --> 01:05:49,412
I promise.

787
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:04,419
We need to get you
to a hospital.

788
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:08,473
It's a little late for that.

789
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:13,394
You saved my son.

790
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:16,394
Well... well, no,
you did that.

791
01:06:16,473 --> 01:06:18,441
Come with us.

792
01:06:19,142 --> 01:06:21,986
I still have some work to do.

793
01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:24,109
And you need
to get that testimony

794
01:06:24,189 --> 01:06:26,032
to the authorities.

795
01:06:29,194 --> 01:06:30,992
Goodbye.

796
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:33,494
Goodbye.

797
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:39,375
Travis.

798
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:42,419
Zàijiàn, Wolverine.

799
01:06:42,499 --> 01:06:45,799
Zàijiàn, Hulk.

800
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:49,051
Travis.

801
01:06:50,632 --> 01:06:53,761
Is he still alive? Whoa, hey!
That's my ticket downtown.

802
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:55,345
Okay, guys.

803
01:06:56,471 --> 01:06:58,644
I hope you know
I know every protocol

804
01:06:58,723 --> 01:07:00,441
for bringing in a passenger.

805
01:07:00,517 --> 01:07:01,689
So if you deviate,

806
01:07:01,809 --> 01:07:03,061
try to expose my position,

807
01:07:03,186 --> 01:07:05,860
I will not hesitate
to eliminate you.

808
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:07,490
- Okay.
- You got it?

809
01:07:07,565 --> 01:07:08,407
Yes, sir.

810
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:11,324
So call it in, all right?

811
01:07:11,402 --> 01:07:12,779
Calm.
Just be calm.

812
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:14,705
- Just call it in.
- Okay.

813
01:07:14,822 --> 01:07:18,417
Red Mountain base,
this is Retrieval Unit 2.

814
01:07:18,535 --> 01:07:20,037
Inbound with passenger.

815
01:07:20,161 --> 01:07:20,832
Over.

816
01:07:20,912 --> 01:07:22,585
Retrieval Unit 2,

817
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:23,922
this is Red Mountain Base.

818
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,007
Please identify.

819
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:27,836
Whiskey-foxtrot 9-3-4-2.

820
01:07:27,961 --> 01:07:30,384
Confirmed. Your team missed
your last' mile marker check-in.

821
01:07:30,505 --> 01:07:32,303
What's the status
of the passenger?

822
01:07:32,382 --> 01:07:36,558
Passenger is secure.
Approaching east gate now.

823
01:07:36,678 --> 01:07:39,227
Copy that. Proceed.

824
01:07:39,681 --> 01:07:41,604
All right, you did a great job.

825
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:42,725
You can relax.

826
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:44,898
You know, I just probably
should let you know

827
01:07:45,019 --> 01:07:49,115
that I'm going to be dead
in about 18 minutes.

828
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:50,779
So the only thing
I give a shit about

829
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:52,447
is fucking with these
guys long enough

830
01:07:52,569 --> 01:07:54,947
to let this woman
and her child live.

831
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:56,493
- You got it?
- Yes, sir.

832
01:07:56,573 --> 01:07:59,076
If you'd like to see tomorrow,

833
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:02,249
you just keep making shit work.

834
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:09,419
You saved my ass back there.

835
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:12,217
Semper fi, buddy.

836
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:18,811
Is something going on?

837
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:21,977
We've been through some
crazy shit, huh, buddy?

838
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:24,317
Hell, yeah, we have.

839
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:28,029
We've always known the risks.

840
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:29,151
Right?

841
01:08:29,272 --> 01:08:33,527
The people that we go after...

842
01:08:33,610 --> 01:08:35,453
can retaliate.

843
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:38,164
Something happen?

844
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:41,455
Something happen to Jasmin?

845
01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:47,002
No, man.

846
01:08:48,249 --> 01:08:50,502
Kate and Adam.

847
01:08:52,337 --> 01:08:54,840
What?

848
01:08:57,967 --> 01:08:59,514
They're...

849
01:08:59,636 --> 01:09:01,513
they're gone.

850
01:09:03,431 --> 01:09:05,650
Man, I'm sorry.

851
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:11,689
What the fuck?

852
01:09:11,773 --> 01:09:14,447
This is not a kid.

853
01:09:16,361 --> 01:09:19,080
- Please don't shoot me. I'll do whatever you want.
- Sit up. Sit up!

854
01:09:21,616 --> 01:09:22,833
Excuse me, sir.

855
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:24,702
There appears to be a disruption

856
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:26,170
occurring at the north gate.

857
01:09:26,287 --> 01:09:29,166
Loading closed-circuit
video now.

858
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:33,841
Put us in full lockdown.

859
01:09:33,961 --> 01:09:36,214
Then tell Mr. Morrow
I'd like to see him.

860
01:09:36,339 --> 01:09:38,057
Yes, sir.

861
01:09:38,633 --> 01:09:41,182
Sir, we have a situation
at the front gate.

862
01:09:41,302 --> 01:09:43,680
Yeah. I know.

863
01:09:44,681 --> 01:09:46,308
Fucking Conrad.

864
01:09:56,484 --> 01:09:57,656
Sir?

865
01:09:59,529 --> 01:10:00,325
Explain.

866
01:10:00,405 --> 01:10:02,282
Go home.
Get out of here!

867
01:10:02,365 --> 01:10:05,494
Go home before I change my mind.

868
01:10:11,666 --> 01:10:15,387
All right, Travis.
Now let's get to work.

869
01:10:15,503 --> 01:10:17,847
What are you thinking?

870
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:20,679
Patch me through to the gate.

871
01:10:20,758 --> 01:10:22,977
Right away, sir.

872
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:25,305
Let me talk to him.

873
01:10:28,808 --> 01:10:30,856
Travis, it's me.

874
01:10:30,935 --> 01:10:32,687
It's over, buddy.

875
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:34,067
You hear me?

876
01:10:34,188 --> 01:10:34,939
These guys,

877
01:10:35,022 --> 01:10:37,866
they're not like us-

878
01:10:37,942 --> 01:10:40,240
There is no loyalty.

879
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:43,243
There is no code.

880
01:10:43,614 --> 01:10:46,959
There's only one code
that I live by, Conrad.

881
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:51,252
And that's for people
to do whatever the fuck I say.

882
01:10:51,372 --> 01:10:54,876
I just ordered a team
to find and kill

883
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:56,131
your father-in-law.

884
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:59,969
Give us the memory card.

885
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:02,387
That's all we want.

886
01:11:02,467 --> 01:11:03,514
Nobody gets hurt.

887
01:11:03,593 --> 01:11:08,770
Oh, Jim, we both know
that's not true.

888
01:11:11,642 --> 01:11:13,736
Patch me through everywhere.

889
01:11:13,811 --> 01:11:15,279
Right away, sir.

890
01:11:15,396 --> 01:11:16,773
Oh, come on, Frank.
Come on, Frank.

891
01:11:16,898 --> 01:11:18,024
Shit.

892
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:21,111
Move in and
capture the driver of that vehicle.

893
01:11:21,235 --> 01:11:25,331
If he tries to retreat,
resist or advance,

894
01:11:25,448 --> 01:11:26,324
shoot to kill.

895
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:35,167
Oh, shit.

896
01:11:37,585 --> 01:11:40,179
Looks like we're both fucked.

897
01:11:40,797 --> 01:11:43,516
All right, Travis.

898
01:11:44,675 --> 01:11:51,149
The shortest distance between
two points is a straight line.

899
01:11:52,183 --> 01:11:54,231
This one's for you, Frank.

900
01:12:29,512 --> 01:12:31,389
Hold. Go, go, go, go.

901
01:12:31,514 --> 01:12:34,734
Secure the vehicle first.

902
01:12:39,856 --> 01:12:42,029
Make sure he's dead.

903
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:18,895
One, two, three.

904
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:21,364
Cover me.
Left side.

905
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:24,404
Sir, the vehicle
is inaccessible.

906
01:13:24,525 --> 01:13:27,119
The stairwell's totally blocked.

907
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:28,658
Go around.

908
01:13:28,738 --> 01:13:31,036
I want a team up here now.

909
01:13:31,115 --> 01:13:32,116
Yes, sir.

910
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:34,118
Echo Team on me.
Move.

911
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:36,541
Send a strike team to
find the Interpol agent

912
01:13:36,621 --> 01:13:37,747
and that fucking card.

913
01:13:37,872 --> 01:13:40,500
Yes, sir. Right away.

914
01:13:57,391 --> 01:13:59,769
You got the right place.

915
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:05,199
And the right time.

916
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:07,743
♪ Tell me, how do you feel? ♪

917
01:14:07,818 --> 01:14:11,618
♪ Well, now I feel
Pretty good ♪

918
01:14:13,491 --> 01:14:15,835
♪ Tell me, how do you feel? ♪

919
01:14:15,952 --> 01:14:16,953
Motherfuckers.

920
01:14:17,078 --> 01:14:19,251
♪ Well, now / feel
Very good ♪

921
01:14:19,330 --> 01:14:21,298
Strike team, moving out.

922
01:14:21,415 --> 01:14:23,167
Copy that.

923
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:32,431
I want a status report.
On the target right now.

924
01:14:32,927 --> 01:14:34,645
Copy that.

925
01:14:34,762 --> 01:14:37,515
Approaching the vehicle now.

926
01:14:49,527 --> 01:14:51,120
What is that?

927
01:14:57,284 --> 01:14:59,378
- The security gate is down.
- Open it.

928
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:03,500
Sir, s security system
breech has been defected.

929
01:15:03,624 --> 01:15:06,878
All perimeter gates
are unresponsive.

930
01:15:07,003 --> 01:15:08,471
It's him.

931
01:15:08,546 --> 01:15:11,891
He's still alive.

932
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:19,015
Sir, there's nobody
in the vehicle.

933
01:15:20,683 --> 01:15:22,685
He's protecting the girl.

934
01:15:25,604 --> 01:15:27,322
He's trying to fuck with us.

935
01:15:29,734 --> 01:15:33,204
Shit. Sir, we got C-4
wired to explode here.

936
01:15:33,487 --> 01:15:35,910
We got another here!

937
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:59,222
Watch it, watch it,
watch it, watch the lights.

938
01:16:05,186 --> 01:16:06,403
Secure the room.

939
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:08,735
No one gets in here.

940
01:16:15,071 --> 01:16:16,493
Tech, you copy?

941
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:19,325
Yes sir. What
can I do for you?

942
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:20,660
Send the chopper.

943
01:16:20,743 --> 01:16:26,000
And get me an outside strike
team on that Interpol bitch.

944
01:16:26,082 --> 01:16:29,586
Call me the second you have her.

945
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:50,815
Stay frosty, boys.

946
01:17:07,081 --> 01:17:08,458
What are you doing?

947
01:17:11,168 --> 01:17:14,138
I'm having a drink.

948
01:17:20,594 --> 01:17:22,062
You want one?

949
01:17:29,145 --> 01:17:32,024
A million dollars to the
man who kills Conrad.

950
01:17:32,148 --> 01:17:34,571
But only if he
fucking stays dead!

951
01:19:45,656 --> 01:19:49,627
I am so sorry.

952
01:19:51,745 --> 01:19:53,088
It's okay, Dad.

953
01:19:53,163 --> 01:19:56,133
You're almost home.

954
01:20:12,474 --> 01:20:15,819
Come on out, Travis.

955
01:20:49,970 --> 01:20:53,645
Sir, your transport has arrived.

956
01:21:22,711 --> 01:21:24,588
You don't want to shoot him,

957
01:21:24,671 --> 01:21:28,266
because you think
he's your friend.

958
01:21:29,218 --> 01:21:32,222
He had no problem
looking the other way

959
01:21:32,346 --> 01:21:36,897
when I ordered Adam and
Kate to be killed.

960
01:21:55,619 --> 01:21:59,749
A man with no family
has nothing to lose.

961
01:22:17,724 --> 01:22:19,146
You knew.

962
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:24,023
He didn't want you to quit.

963
01:22:30,154 --> 01:22:32,828
He didn't want you to quit.

964
01:22:34,741 --> 01:22:36,334
You could have saved them.

965
01:22:36,452 --> 01:22:39,797
We could have saved them.

966
01:22:40,581 --> 01:22:42,424
I was protecting my family.

967
01:22:44,626 --> 01:22:48,301
It was mine or yours.

968
01:22:57,181 --> 01:22:59,104
Do it.

969
01:23:01,685 --> 01:23:03,779
Shoot me.

970
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,844
I don't want to kill you.

971
01:23:35,052 --> 01:23:38,477
I want the fish to like me.

972
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:03,915
Sir, we've located the
Interpol agent and her son.

973
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:08,385
The local strike team is
being patched through now.

974
01:24:15,592 --> 01:24:17,686
I got eyes on him.

975
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:22,900
Should I take the shot?

976
01:24:24,184 --> 01:24:26,061
Negative.

977
01:24:28,564 --> 01:24:30,908
Stand down.

978
01:24:34,486 --> 01:24:36,705
Let him live.

979
01:25:05,726 --> 01:25:07,649
Semper fi.

980
01:25:35,756 --> 01:25:38,509
You know what this is?

981
01:25:39,468 --> 01:25:42,062
This is the moment
where you realize

982
01:25:42,137 --> 01:25:46,062
that the line between
friendship and profession

983
01:25:46,141 --> 01:25:49,065
is not where you thought it was.

984
01:25:50,437 --> 01:25:52,610
Fuck you.

985
01:26:00,572 --> 01:26:03,792
Drop your weapon!
Drop your fucking weapon!

986
01:26:07,871 --> 01:26:09,794
Put it down!

987
01:26:12,834 --> 01:26:15,963
Don't do it.

988
01:27:19,776 --> 01:27:20,652
Hey.

989
01:27:20,736 --> 01:27:22,830
- Come here.
