00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,512
Yes. The Viceroy asked Mr. Tyler,
sir, but actually it was me.

329
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,117
You have to have a very
good eye for the carpets.

330
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,790
Like, this is a very
nice one, for example.

331
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,916
Very, very tight knots.

332
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,555
The art of carpets

333
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,508
came to India from Persia
with the great Emperor Akbar.

334
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,675
The skill of a carpet

335
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,031
is to bring all the different
kinds of threads together

336
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,636
and weave something
we can all stand on.

337
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,995
You seem to know
a great deal about it.

338
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,755
My family were
carpet makers,

339
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,111
but now I write in the book.

340
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,514
Life is like a carpet.

341
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,752
We weave in and out
to make a pattern.

342
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,551
That is a very
beautiful image.

343
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,680
Look.

344
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,476
Here is the bird of freedom
caught forever in the design.

345
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,149
So, in India you are a poet?

346
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,389
No.

347
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,154
In India, I make
a ledger of the prisoners.

348
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,354
We are all prisoners,
Mr. Karim.

349
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,398
Apparently, he's a poet.

351
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,478
(SPEAKING URDU)

352
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,873
These people
are the exploiters

353
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,712
of a quarter of
all of mankind.

354
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:10,072
Do you really think they
give a hoot about us, huh?

355
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,990
We'll bloody well
freeze to death at this rate.

356
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,799
Cut all the nicey-nicey crap,
and let's get the hell out of here.

357
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,995
Agreed?

358
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,708
I promise.

359
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,354
Good night.

360
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,991
Will you stop doing that?

361
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,633
You realize

362
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,993
this is the third day
in a row.

363
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,595
QUEEN VICTORIA: So, Mr. Abdul,

364
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,956
may I ask what part
of India you're from?

365
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,668
I'm from Agra.

366
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,992
The Taj Mahal?

367
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,480
You have been
to the Taj Mahal?

368
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,715
No.

369
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,836
It is the most
marvelous building

370
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,876
in the entire world,
Your Majesty.

371
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,191
The Crown of Palaces.

372
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:15,469
It was built by Shah Jahan
to remember his dead wife

373
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,598
who died at childbirth
during their fourteenth child.

374
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,269
Goodness!

375
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,430
He was so upset with grief,

376
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,469
he brought the greatest architects
from Persia, Afghanistan,

377
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,471
to build the Taj Mahal.

378
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,588
It certainly sounds
a handsome building.

379
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,153
I'd very much
like to see it.

380
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,117
Oh, it is beautiful,
Your Majesty!

381
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,236
It's all white marble.

382
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,280
All that beauty
for the dead Queen.

383
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,998
Mmm. How romantic.

384
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,788
ABDUL: Shah Jahan also
built the Red Fort,

385
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,152
the Gardens of Shalimar,
the Peacock Throne.

386
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,828
The Peacock Throne?

387
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,389
It is the most beautiful
throne in all the world.

388
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,916
And inside the throne
was the Koh-i-noor.

389
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,275
But I have the Koh-i-noor.
I wear it as a brooch.

390
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,439
Do you?
Yes!

391
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,273
It wasn't very shiny,
so Albert had it recut.

392
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,677
What happened to
the Peacock Throne?

393
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,149
They smashed it up.

394
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,309
How awful.

395
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,312
They're always
smashing things up.

396
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,790
The British soldiers have taken
the jewels from the Taj Mahal.

397
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,678
British soldiers?

398
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,751
Yes, after the Mutiny.

399
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,918
But this is terrible.

400
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,311
What can they
be talking about?

401
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,796
A servant and an Indian.

402
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,280
What on Earth
does she see in him?

403
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,677
Well, he is
rather handsome.

404
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,316
What happened
to Shah Jahan?

405
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,913
He was overthrown by his son
and died in Agra Fort.

406
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,992
The wickedness of children.

407
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,509
They buried him in the Taj
Mahal with his wife, Mumtaz.

408
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,116
They also wrote
an inscription.

409
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,470
"Here lies Shah Jahan

410
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,156
"who left this world for
the Banquet Hall of Eternity."

411
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,277
"The Banquet
Hall of Eternity."

412
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,437
I rather like that idea.

413
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,992
You seem very well
informed.

414
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,709
Ah, these are famous
stories of Uttar Pradesh.

415
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,949
You should go there.

416
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,792
Oh, I can never go there.
I'm forbidden.

417
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,029
Forbidden?

418
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,031
They fear I would
be assassinated.

419
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,510
So, you have never
seen an Indian street?

420
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,391
Or a stall of spices?
No.

421
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,560
Oh...

422
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,789
Oh, the spices!

423
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,349
Cumin, coriander,

424
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,794
garam masala.

425
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,560
Garam masa...
What is garam masala?

426
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,836
It is what you
put into the sauce.

427
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,435
You have never
tasted Indian food?

429
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,471
Biryani with mango chutney.

430

Mango chutney?

431

Chutney made out of mango.

432

What is mango?

433
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,790
Mango is the queen of fruit.

434
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,871
What does it taste like?

435
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,395
Like an orange

436
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,710
and a peach.

437
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,120

Yes, I would like
to taste a mango.

Good morning, Your Majesty.

You may go.

00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,837
I'm perfectly capable
of working through the boxes.

Abdul is very helpful
with his blotter.

But these are parliamentary

I'm aware of that.

But Abdul is a servant.

481

He cannot assist
with the boxes.

I will have whatever help
I require with the boxes.

484

And, Sir Henry,

485
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,118
would you get some

Well, I'm Empress of India.

494
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,755
Look, I've ordered a book.

495

I want you to give me
private lessons.

I can't teach you Hindi,

You are the
Empress of India.

499
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,432
You should learn Urdu,
language of the Mughals.

The Munshi is a Muslim scholar and
knows the Koran off by heart.

He so admired the Medicis,

688
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,395
that they commissioned the
greatest artists of the day

astonishing behind.

In India also,
we commission great artists.

691
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,672
Each emperor would bring
the greatest craftsmen

Durbar room?
Yes.

694

Every emperor
had a durbar room,

full of the finest
things known to man.

00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:49,314
And so we are honored to
repay it in our own small way.

820
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,070
What is ours is yours.

821
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,593
Quite literally.

822
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,154
Alhamdulilah.

823
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,077
QUEEN VICTORIA:
My dear Munshi,

824
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,591
we are so glad to have
you here, my children.

825
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,751
We have missed you enormously.

826
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,880
I can't wait to show
you the Durbar Room.

827
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,594
Children?

828
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:12,155
Ponsonby, you will have to do
something about this.

829
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,834
My dear Munshi,
I'm so glad you're back.

830
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,669
It's been dreadfully
dull without you.

831
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:20,954
And I'm so glad
to meet Mrs. Karim.

832
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:27,233
There is just one thing I've been
curious about the whole afternoon.

833
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:30,236
What does she look like
behind her veil?

834
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,029
You must see her.

835
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:33,394
Is that allowed?

836
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:36,917
You're a lady.
And the Empress of India.

837
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,080
Oh...

838
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,436
Well, where the bloody
hell's she going now?

839
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,638
Your Majesty.

840
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:15,359
(CHUCKLES)

841
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:18,320
Oh...

842
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,590
You really are beautiful.

843
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:22,680
(CHUCKLES)

844
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,751
LORD SALISBURY: What on
Earth is a durbar room?

845
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,513
It's a celebration of all
things Indian, Prime Minister,

846
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:31,319
inspired by
the Mughal emperors.

847
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:32,913
But I don't understand.

848
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:35,429
Who gave her permission to
build this in the first place?

849
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:38,319
Don't blame me,
I was in Monte Carlo.

850
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,520
I'm afraid she's a law
unto herself, Prime Minister.

851
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:43,433
For God's sake!
She'll be wearing a burqa next.

852
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,594
Prime Minister,
you are late.

853
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:49,268
I'm terribly sorry,
Your Majesty.

854
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,032
Well, let us begin.

855
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:55,193
This, as you can see,
is the Indian corridor.

856
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:01,199
The Durbar Room was designed
by Mr. Bhai Ram Singh.

857
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,951
The place is
crawling with them.

858
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:08,715
We have commissioned a series of
portraits of eminent Indians.

859
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,029
This...

860
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,390
Princess Gowramma.

861
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,551
And this of course,

862
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,392
is the Munshi.

863
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,551
An honor to meet you,
Mr. Prime Minister, sir.

864
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,551
A good likeness,
don't you think?

865
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,912
I asked him to
take a few pounds off.

866
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,755
This is my wife,
Mr. Prime Minister, sir.

867
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,559
And that is my mother-in-law.

868
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:35,399
At least I think
that's the right way round.

869
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:36,600
(LAUGHS)

870
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,999
These are my servants,

871
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:40,991
Mohammed and Ahmed.

872
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:44,152
And this is the Durbar Room.

873
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:48,072
What the hell is
going on here, Ponsonby?

874
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,069
The carvings are
from Uttar Pradesh.

875
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:01,953
And the carpet was
woven in a jail in Agra.

876
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,429
Perfect, I think,
for the tableau.

877
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,396
But the pièce de résistance

878
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:10,279
is the Peacock Throne.

879
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:13,273
An exact copy
of the one at Agra.

880
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,119
And, of course, the Koh-i-noor.

881
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:21,234
Now I really do feel
like the Empress of India.

882
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:24,795
I thought she was
supposed to be dying.

883
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:28,430
It really is a remarkable addition
to the house, Your Majesty.

884
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:31,034
We have Abdul to
thank for the whole idea.

885
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:33,629
To celebrate the completion
of the Durbar Room,

886
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,791
a little surprise,
Your Majesty.

887
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:39,759
What is it?

888
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,310
A mango, Your Majesty.

889
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,631
One moment, Your Majesty.

890
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:51,640
Uh...

891
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:54,479
It's off.

892
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,239
Sir Henry.

893
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,992
This mango is off.

894
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,349
I'm terribly sorry,
Your Majesty.

895
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:13,478
Take one of these
whenever you see the Munshi.

896
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:17,957
QUEEN VICTORIA: I can't wait to show
you the tableau, Prime Minister.

897
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:23,512
A line has definitively
been crossed.

898
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,750
I can't go on stage like this.

899
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,518
I'm absolutely sick.

900
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:29,829
But you have to.

901
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,433
The Prime Minister
will be watching.

902
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:34,160
This is a complete
and utter disaster.

903
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:37,256
I don't know what
you're talking about.

904
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,416
They've been waiting
for this.

905
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:39,440
Who? Who have?

906
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:41,710
Ponsonby, Reid,
the whole damn lot.

907
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,696
Don't you see? She's been
rubbing their noses in it,

908
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:44,914
but now it's going public.

909
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,389
I'm telling you, they're
not going to stand for it.

910
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:49,471
They'll rise up and chop
your bloody balls off.

911
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:50,709
I haven't done anything.

912
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:51,960
You stupid bloody Uncle Tom.

913
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,718
You can't win on their terms.

914
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:55,479
(INDISTINCT WHISPERING)

915
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:59,032
Mrs. Munshi.

916
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,513
Bertie.

917
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:11,229
I've never been so humiliated
in my entire life.

918
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:14,312
Actually,
I'm rather enjoying it.

919
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:16,751
Beginners on stage,
please.

920
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:22,231
A scene in Ancient Persia.

921
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:24,440
(TRUMPETS PLAYING)

922
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:30,753
I am the Sultan of Persia.

923
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,832
The King of all Kings.

924
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:51,113
Your Highness!

925
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:56,434
We bestow upon you all the
riches of the Orient.

926
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:06,234
You are now under my power!

927
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:20,949
Bravo, bravo,
the Munshi!

928
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,557
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

929
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:41,076
What the hell is this,
Ponsonby? Munshi-mania?

930
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:43,310
I'm trying to keep
an empire together,

931
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:45,391
looks like they're
running the place.

932
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:48,992
I want this whole sodding mess
knocked on the head.

933
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:50,639
Or you're finished.

934
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,153
Understood?

935
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:02,758
QUEEN VICTORIA:
Oh, Sir Henry.

936
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,788
Tell us what exactly did the Prime
Minister say about the tableau?

937
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,157
To be entirely frank,
Your Majesty,

938
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:13,436
he seemed to be
a little perturbed.

939
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:14,953
Whatever for?

940
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:16,519
He must have liked
the Munshi.

941
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:19,433
I think the Munshi was
the problem, Your Majesty.

942
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:21,511
Really? I thought
he was rather good.

943
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:24,080
I think he meant his position,
I think he was rather alarmed

944
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:27,874
he had such a prominent role
in the Household.

945
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:30,656
QUEEN VICTORIA: Of course Abdul has
a prominent role in the Household.

946
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:31,795
He is my munshi.

947
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:34,030
But he's an Indian,
Your Majesty.

948
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:35,948
I am aware of that.

949
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:39,552
Given current sensitivities in
the subcontinent, Your Majesty,

950
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:42,712
the Prime Minister was
concerned that it might be

951
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:45,314
sending the wrong message.

952
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:48,793
I should have thought
it was a jolly good message.

953
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:50,393
But he's a Muslim,
Your Majesty.

954
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,152
Precisely.

955
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:54,671
We owe them so much,
do we not?

956
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:57,915
For their role in the Mutiny,
for example.

957
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,033
The Mutiny, Your Majesty?

958
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:04,158
Yes, for the help they gave us
with the Hindus.

959
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:12,070
But the Mutiny was a Muslim-led
revolt, Your Majesty.

960
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,033
Are you sure?

961
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,599
DR. REID: Of course.

962
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:20,876
The Muslim soldiers revolted

963
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:25,033
when it was rumored that their
rifles were greased with pork fat.

964
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:29,593
Really?

965
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:32,509
SIR HENRY:
The Grand Mufti, himself,

966
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:36,195
put out a fatwa against you
personally, Your Majesty.

967
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:41,673
And Muslim soldiers murdered over
two thousand British personnel.

968
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,556
Who have you been
talking to, Mother?

969
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:52,640
Ta-da!

970
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:57,950
I have opened
my heart to you.

971
01:01:58,120 --> 01:01:59,951
I brought your
family from India.

972
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:02,793
I promoted you in the face
of considerable opposition

973
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:05,229
and disquiet
from the Household.

974
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:06,953
I even turned
a blind eye

975
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:09,435
when you failed to tell me
that you were married,

976
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,478
which, as you know,
came as quite a surprise.

977
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:14,517
How could you let me
humiliate myself

978
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,596
in front of
the entire Household?

979
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,392
I am deeply sorry,
Your Majesty.

980
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:22,633
QUEEN VICTORIA: You said the
Hindus were behind the Mutiny.

981
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:24,456
ABDUL: I didn't say
it was only the Hindus.

982
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:27,096
QUEEN VICTORIA: You told me categorically
the Muslims were my friends.

983
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,456
ABDUL: We are
your friends, Your...

984
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,480
QUEEN VICTORIA: Abdul,
there is a fatwa against me.

985
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:32,955
It was the Muslims
who started the whole thing.

986
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:35,509
This is completely
unacceptable.

987
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:42,991
Abdul, I thought you were outstanding
as the Sultan of Persia,

988
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:45,435
but I'm afraid
you have to go home.

989
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:49,909
(MOUTHING)
Hallelujah!

990
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:57,318
You've hurt my feelings
very much indeed.

991
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:00,191
Don't you see the position
you have put me in?

992
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:08,193
Thank you for everything
you've done for me.

993
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,037
I will miss you
a very great deal.

994
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:41,030
So, we're going home?

995
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:11,352
Good night, Mother.

996
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:13,873
Good night.

997
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:33,753
(THUNDER RUMBLES)

(SIGHS)

999
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:29,509
Mrs. Tuck?

1000
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:31,509
Mrs. Tuck.

1001
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:36,788
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

1002
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:40,314
(LIGHTNING CRASHES)

1003
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:46,114
Abdul.

1004
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:48,759
You've been an utter fool.

1005
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:51,474
And I'm absolutely
furious with you.

1006
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:54,715
It is unconscionable
that as my munshi

1007
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:57,189
you should have
lied to me in any way.

1008
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
But...

1009
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:02,550
It would be also
completely churlish of me

1010
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:06,556
not to recognize
the considerable kindness

1011
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:08,517
and devotion
you have shown.

1012
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:15,030
I suppose in some way you
thought you were protecting me.

1013
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:20,879
But as the monarch I realize that
nothing can really protect me.

1014
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:24,709
And so, in that light,
I have decided,

1015
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:28,031
although I'm
very disappointed,

1016
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:31,189
that I want you to stay.

1017
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:38,074
Your gracious Majesty.
Thank you, Your Majesty.

1018
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:42,028
Abdul, there is something
we must sort out.

1019
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:47,596
I am deeply concerned
about Mrs. Karim.

1020
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:49,669
Mrs. Karim?

1021
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,429
By now,
one would have expected

1022
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:57,275
to hear the pitter-patter
of little Muslim feet

1023
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:59,908
along the corridors
of Osborne House.

1024
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:05,113
I am concerned
that everything is

1025
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:08,952
functioning below stairs.

1026
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:15,237
I want you to examine
Mrs. Karim.

1027
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:17,599
Examine Mrs. Karim?

1028
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:18,800
Mm.

1029
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:23,751
Just, um, make sure that
everything's working.

1030
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:26,235
But, Your Majesty,

1031
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:29,278
I thought the Munshi and
his family were leaving us.

1032
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:31,278
Whatever gave you
that impression?

1033
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:37,316
The Munshi and his family are integral
parts of the Royal Household.

1034
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:41,000
BERTIE:
As far as I'm concerned,

1035
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:42,040
this is war.

1036
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:43,639
We're going to dig
up every last bit

1037
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:45,313
of dirt this
blackguard's ever done.

1038
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:48,153
I want someone in India raking
through the family coals.

1039
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:50,151
Your son's out there,
isn't he, Ponsonby?

1040
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:51,878
I couldn't
possibly be involved

1041
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,558
in subterfuge,
Your Royal Highness.

1042
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:56,629
Look, very soon
I am going to be King.

1043
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:59,559
You will bloody well do
as you're told!

1044
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:02,153
You'll leave
no stone unturned.

1045
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:04,960
You will make a dossier, and you put
it all down in black and white.

1046
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,275
And put an end
to all this shit!

1047
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:09,758
For good.

1048
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:20,198
Well, I'd better go
and examine Mrs. Munshi.

1049
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:23,474
ABDUL: Dr. Reid.

1050
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:25,668
Do come in.

1051
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:29,274
She'll have to
uncover her face.

1052
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:31,590
That is impossible, sir.

1053
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:33,876
I need to see
her tongue.

1054
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:37,272
(SPEAKING URDU)

1055
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:44,029
Well?

1056
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:45,589
She's fine.

1057
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:57,394
SIR HENRY: Mr. Mohammed.

1058
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:02,395
We have come here because we are
not unaware of your predicament.

1059
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:05,393
That you arrived in the first
place almost by accident,

1060
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:07,710
and now find
yourself stuck here

1061
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:11,668
through a bizarre set of circumstances,
none of your own making.

1062
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:15,557
Nor is it beneath
our notice

1063
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:17,392
that the inclement
English weather

1064
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:19,240
has been the cause
of a precipitous decline

1065
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:21,391
in your general health.

1066
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:24,232
What is more,

1067
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:28,756
you continue to suffer
the vast indignity

1068
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:33,391
of being a servant to someone who
is in many ways your inferior.

1069
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,830
So, it occurred
to us that, um,

1070
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:40,073
we might be able to
offer you some help.

1071
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:44,675
Help?

1072
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:46,068
Travel home.

1073
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:48,271
Perhaps a modest pension.

1074
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:50,715
In return, of course,
for, um...

1075
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,955
A little information.

1076
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:03,071
You want me to

1077
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:05,233
dish the dirty?

1078
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:08,278
In a manner of speaking.

1079
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:16,191
What would you
like me to say?

1080
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:18,032
Anything, really.

1081
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:20,911
Well, we need details.

1082
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:23,268
What he says.

1083
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:25,632
What he does.

1084
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:35,999
Abdul does what
everyone else does.

1085
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:37,309
He, uh...

1086
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:41,594
He looks for preferment.

1087
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,951
He curries favor.

1088
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:57,158
He crawls up
the stinking greasy pole

1089
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:00,351
of the shitty British Empire.

1090
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:08,468
Making fools of all of you,
because he is a servant.

1091
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:12,271
An Indian Muslim servant,

1092
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:15,034
and you are all
quaking in your boots

1093
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:18,829
because he's beating you
at your own game.

1094
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:22,157
No one is quaking
in their boots.

1095
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,993
We are the most
powerful nation on Earth.

1096
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:26,878
At the height
of our influence.

1097
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:29,031
In that case,

1098
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:31,715
the only way is down.

1099
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:36,668
So stick your
stupid British Empire

1100
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:42,155
up your stinky royal bottom hole,
Mr. Bertie Prince, sir.

1101
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:52,797
I hope he makes the whole damn
thing come tumbling down.

1102

(MUFFLED COUGH)

1103
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:05,674
I will see to it
that you die here.

1104
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:14,709
He didn't say anything.

1105
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:17,155
What do you mean,
"He didn't say anything"?

1106
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:18,753
We did our best with him,

1107
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:20,672
but he spoke
most intemperately.

1108
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:22,558
The man is an
absolute shit.

1109

Dr. Reid.

1110
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:27,398
I'm not a fool.

1111
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:29,278
I know there is some
skullduggery afoot.

1112
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:32,352
Something's going on here, and
I'm not going to stand for it.

1113
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:33,999
Dr. Reid,

1114
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:35,918
I asked you to
get to the bottom

1115
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:37,752
of Mrs. Karim's
fertility issues.

1116
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:39,592
It seems that
nothing has been done.

1117
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:42,271
Well, actually,
Your Majesty,

1118
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:46,274
it was impossible to make
a conclusive judgment

1119
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:48,434
for religious reasons.

1120
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:49,953
Did you examine the Munshi?

1121
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:52,155
No, Your Majesty.

1122
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:53,395
Well, examine the Munshi.

1123
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:54,919
Bertie.

1124
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:03,868
I did not do seven years
at Edinburgh University

1125
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:06,190
to look at Indian dicks!

of my Urdu lesson.

news of a highly personal matter.

hide from Abdul.

1137
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:15,154
Your Majesty...

1138
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:19,714
I'm afraid our news
concerns the Munshi.

1139
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:24,030
We have proof beyond any doubt
that Abdul Karim

1140
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:29,672
is a low-born impostor,

1141
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:32,356
Your Majesty.

1142
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:39,671
The Munshi is from a noble family
and a long line of teachers.

1143
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:43,355
No, I'm afraid he was a mere
clerk in a common jail.

1144
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:48,235
My own son has sent word from
India and has actually spoken

1145
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:50,550
to his immediate superior.

1146
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:54,869
His family are
completely uneducated.

1147
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:58,237
His father is
a lowly apothecary.

1148
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:01,518
BERTIE: The Munshi never even
went to school, Mother.

1149
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:03,718
The man's a complete fraud.

1150
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:05,916
And here he is,
overlooking the boxes.

1151
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:08,436
SIR HENRY: I'm afraid it's true,
Your Majesty.

1152
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:11,918
Abdul and his father
are completely common.

1153
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:17,071
We have prepared a dossier.

1154
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:19,430
You despicable toads!

1155
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,433
Racialists!

1156
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:24,397
Spying? Dossier?

1157
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:26,551
Picking on a poor
defenseless Indian?

1158
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:28,438
Of course he doesn't
have qualifications.

1159
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:31,751
They do things completely
differently out there.

1160
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:33,029
Don't you see, Mama?

1161
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:36,078
He's using his position
for his own gain.

1162
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:39,870
And how does that make him
any different from any of you?

1163
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:43,950
How dare you
look down on Abdul?

1164
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:46,950
How dare you defame
his poor father?

1165
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:49,953
Bertie, I'm ashamed
that you're part of all this.

1166
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:53,952
Abdul is a loyal, wise,
sympathetic human being,

1167
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:56,716
who has raised himself
on his own merits.

1168
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:59,271
Bring Abdul in here.

1169
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:02,598
Bring him in!

1170
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:08,238
Now, I want you
to repeat after me,

1171
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,072
"I will be courteous
to the Munshi."

1172
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,992
I will be courteous
to the Munshi.

1173
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,120
You.

1174
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:28,072
I will be courteous
to the Munshi.

1175
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:29,919
Bertie. All of you.

1176
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:33,470
"I will be courteous
to the Munshi."

1177
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:37,911
ALL: I will be courteous
to the Munshi.

1178
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:39,991
It has become apparent

1179
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:43,432
that in order to get any
respect from the Household,

1180
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,272
one needs to be
formally recognized.

1181
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:48,793
In which case, Abdul.

1182
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:53,953
I intend to give you a knighthood
in the next honors list.

1183
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:56,509
Enough! This is absurd!

1184
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:59,191
We cannot protect you
from this any further.

1185
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:01,157
The man is riddled
with gonorrhea!

1186
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:05,915
Gonorrhea?

1187
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:09,678
SIR HENRY:
Yes. Your Majesty.

1188
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:19,395
Well, you are a doctor.
Why don't you treat him?

1189
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:21,835
Now get out of my sight,
all of you!

1190
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:32,551
Listen, you pox-ridden
Indian shit!

1191
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:35,553
Why don't you bloody well leave her alone?
Dr. Reid! Dr. Reid!

1192
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:38,154
Be courteous!

1193
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:39,560
(GRUNTS)

1194
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:41,793
(COUGHING)

1195
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:49,195
Knighted?

1196
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:51,990
Surely there is
some law against it.

1197
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:53,912
The man's a common Indian,
for God's sakes.

1198
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:55,672
Well, she can't
just do what she likes.

1199
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:56,909
That's right.

1200
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:59,196
We are the ones who
make this palace work,

1201
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,152
and we are being ignored

1202
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:02,360
and exploited.
Yes.

1203
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:05,273
We have to stand up
to this wanton bullying.

1204
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:07,192
But she's the Queen.

1205
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:09,278
She's our sovereign.

1206
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:13,911
Her position is based entirely on the
implicit contract she makes with us.

1207
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:17,711
If she does not drop
this preposterous insult,

1208
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:19,911
we should all leave!

1209
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:21,559
Yes.

1210
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:25,351
Somebody has to tell her.

1211
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:29,636
We should make a deputation.

1212
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:32,788
I think you should go.

1213
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:34,871
You're the head
of the Household.

1214
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:36,712
Oh, no,
I couldn't possibly go.

1215
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:38,791
It would bring
the position into disrepute.

1216
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:41,394
Mrs. Tuck.

1217
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:44,957
You know her very well,
don't you?

1218
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:47,276
But I'm just her dresser.

1219
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:48,788
What about you,
Miss Phipps?

1220
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:56,313
Off you go.

1221
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:12,313
And don't take
"no" for an answer.

1222
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:24,679
Your Majesty.

1223
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,149
Out with it.

1224
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:29,192
Girl, can't you see,
I'm busy.

1225
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:33,991
There is something
I must say that...

1226
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:39,668
What is the meaning of this?
Stop shaking!

1227
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:44,315
I have come to ask
you to reconsider the...

1228
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:47,998
The elevation of...

1229
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:50,519
Of Mr. Karim.

1230
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:54,029
What did you say?

1231
01:19:57,040 --> 01:20:00,828
I've come to ask you not to give Mr.
Karim a knighthood, Your Majesty.

1232
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:04,632
Why the devil not?

1233
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:07,715
The members of
the Household demand

1234
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:10,872
that you abandon your plans,
Your Majesty.

1235
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:13,352
Demand?

1236
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:18,870
We believe that it degrades the
very concept of knighthood.

1237
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:23,513
He comes from a very low
family, Your Majesty.

1238
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,548
And

1239
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:28,072
he is colored.

1240
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,558
Get out of my sight.

1241
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:37,355
Did you not hear me?

1242
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:41,593
Your Majesty, I must inform
you that if you refuse,

1243
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:44,752
the entire Household
will resign.

1244
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,433
Treason!

1245
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:49,914
Treason!

1246
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:56,432
Treason.

1247
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:24,950
Mummy, enough is enough.

1248
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:31,714
You will drop this Munshi
business forthwith.

1249
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:33,632
Do you hear me?

1250
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:38,158
Did you really
think the Household

1251
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:39,878
would countenance
such an insult?

1252
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:41,752
I will not be disobeyed.

1253
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:43,273
No. No.

1254
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:46,750
I have put up with
you for over 50 years!

1255
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:49,394
You will drop
this forthwith or...

1256
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:50,629
Or, or, or, or, Bertie?

1257
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:51,909
Or

1258
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:56,392
we will have you
certified insane!

1259
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:01,790
And removed from
office immediately.

1260
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:07,956
Here are the papers
signed by Dr. Reid.

1261
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:28,192
I am 81 years of age.

1262
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:33,352
I've had nine children,
and 42 grandchildren,

1263
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:36,512
and have almost
a billion citizens.

1264
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:41,192
I have rheumatism,

1265
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:43,432
a collapsed uterus.

1266
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:45,631
I'm morbidly obese

1267
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:48,508
and deaf in one ear.

1268
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:54,398
I have known
eleven Prime Ministers

1269
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:59,395
and passed 2,347
pieces of legislation.

1270
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:05,348
I've been in office
62 years, 234 days.

1271
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:08,916
Thus, I am the longest-serving
monarch in world history.

1272
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:15,235
I'm responsible
for five households

1273
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:18,508
and a staff of over 3,000.

1274
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:23,671
I am cantankerous,

1275
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:27,310
boring, greedy,

1276
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:30,239
fat, ill-tempered,

1277
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:35,275
at times selfish and myopic,
both metaphorically and literally.

1278
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:41,754
I am perhaps disagreeably
attached to power

1279
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:47,278
and should not have smashed
the Emperor of Russia's egg.

1280
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:53,393
But I am anything but insane.

1281
01:23:57,040 --> 01:24:00,271
If the Household wish
to disobey me, so be it.

1282
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:03,754
Let them do it
to my face.

1283
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:07,557
I will see everyone
in the Durbar Room at once.

1284
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:33,711
ALICK: Her Majesty the Queen.

1285
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:49,396
I understand
there is some concern

1286
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:52,114
over my desires on preferment.

1287
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:56,520
I understand feelings
have run high.

1288
01:24:56,840 --> 01:25:00,150
And I understand
you have decided to resign,

1289
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:02,828
rather than
withstand my decision.

1290
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:06,591
If any one of you

1291
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:10,593
wishes to tender
their resignation,

1292
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:13,194
it will be accepted

1293
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:17,876
without any unfortunate
