Bluetooth technology.

5
0:0:6.730 --> 0:0:8.365
Which, of course, got its name

6
0:0:8.400 --> 0:0:10.168
from the legendary
Danish king...

7
0:0:10.201 --> 0:0:11.835
Harald Blatand, whose name

8
0:0:11.870 --> 0:0:15.005
translates to
"Bluetooth" in English.

9
0:0:15.040 --> 0:0:16.641
And the Bluetooth logo
is his initials

10
0:0:16.673 --> 0:0:18.242
in Norse runic symbols.

11
0:0:18.275 --> 0:0:20.344
And, as I'm sure you know...

12
0:0:20.378 --> 0:0:22.747
the Bluetooth logo
is his initials...

Why isn't he eating
his fucking pudding?

16
0:0:28.085 --> 0:0:29.920
I need to research
this gold tattoo.

17
0:0:29.955 --> 0:0:31.256
I found records of other people

18
0:0:31.290 --> 0:0:32.758
with the same
body modifications.

19
0:0:34.492 --> 0:0:35.894
All of them have
high level involvement...

20
0:0:35.927 --> 0:0:38.029
with crime and international
drug trafficking.

21
0:0:38.063 --> 0:0:41.131
And there's rumors of something
called The Golden Circle.

22
0:0:41.166 --> 0:0:42.234
Hmm.

BRANDON: Come on, JB.
Give it a rest, mate.

27
0:1:1.954 --> 0:1:5.157
Stop scratching the door.
I'm gonna get the blame now.

28
0:1:5.189 --> 0:1:6.190
There you are. Happy?

29
0:1:21.273 --> 0:1:23.007

36
0:1:41.960 --> 0:1:45.029
I must say, you're really
not as I expected.

37
0:1:46.297 --> 0:1:48.400
Well, thank you very much...

BRANDON: Eggsy?
Is that you, mate?

40
0:1:51.870 --> 0:1:53.804
What the fuck is going on here?

41
0:1:53.838 --> 0:1:55.207
You a gangster now or something?

42
0:1:55.239 --> 0:1:57.808
Fuckin' hell. Is that Tilde's
mom and dad's house?

43
0:1:57.842 --> 0:1:59.477
Tell you what. Whatever
you're doing, I want in.

What's wrong with it?

49

Shut it! Fucking shut it!
