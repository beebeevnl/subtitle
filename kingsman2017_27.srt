1
0:0:1.829 --> 0:0:4.698
is we appear
to agree to her demands

2
0:0:4.733 --> 0:0:6.135
to prevent global panic...

3
0:0:6.167 --> 0:0:11.538
and then let the junkie scum
go down in flames. Huh?

4
0:0:11.573 --> 0:0:13.608
(laughing)

5
0:0:13.641 --> 0:0:15.577
Huh? Yeah.

6
0:0:15.609 --> 0:0:19.580
Take Poppy Adams and her so-called
Golden Circle down with them.

7
0:0:19.614 --> 0:0:24.285
No drug users, no drug trade.
It's a win-win situation here.

8
0:0:24.319 --> 0:0:27.688
But, sir, we're not talking about
a handful of hostages.

9
0:0:27.721 --> 0:0:29.190
We could be looking
at the deaths

10
0:0:29.224 --> 0:0:31.060
of hundreds
of millions worldwide.

11
0:0:31.092 --> 0:0:32.359
Hundreds of millions
of criminals,

12
0:0:32.394 --> 0:0:33.829
burdens to society.

13
0:0:34.663 --> 0:0:36.165
Am I right, McCoy?

14
0:0:36.198 --> 0:0:37.332
Absolutely, sir.

15
0:0:37.365 --> 0:0:39.167
But, sir, that's...

16
0:0:39.200 --> 0:0:41.837
What about people who were
just experimenting?

17
0:0:41.869 --> 0:0:43.805
Folks who self-medicate?

18
0:0:43.838 --> 0:0:46.740
Functioning
professionals? Kids?

19
0:0:46.774 --> 0:0:48.509
Oh, spare me the crap, Fox.

20
0:0:48.542 --> 0:0:49.944
(CHUCKLES) The fact is,

21
0:0:49.977 --> 0:0:53.015
this presidency has just
won the war on drugs.

22
0:0:53.047 --> 0:0:54.282
Congratulations, sir.

23
0:0:54.850 --> 0:0:56.785
Thank you.

24
0:0:58.753 --> 0:1:1.856
And that deserves a toast.

25
0:1:1.891 --> 0:1:4.493
FOX: This is
totally unethical, sir.

26
0:1:4.525 --> 0:1:6.227
PRESIDENT: Fox, shut up!

27
0:1:6.927 --> 0:1:9.064
McCoy, declare martial law.

28
0:1:9.097 --> 0:1:11.800
We need to keep control,
commandeer stadiums,

29
0:1:11.833 --> 0:1:13.735
schools, civic centers...

30
0:1:13.769 --> 0:1:15.169
order a press blackout.

31
0:1:15.203 --> 0:1:17.039
And put the military on standby

32
0:1:17.072 --> 0:1:19.108
to round these junkies up.

33
0:1:20.042 --> 0:1:21.810
Whether they broke
the law or not,

34
0:1:21.843 --> 0:1:24.113
those victims are human beings.

35
0:1:26.381 --> 0:1:27.383
Tequila.

36
0:1:28.583 --> 0:1:30.119
He's a great guy.

37
0:1:31.519 --> 0:1:33.387
And a great agent.

38
0:1:33.421 --> 0:1:37.191
Right now, he's lying in deep
freeze waitin' on our help.

39
0:1:37.225 --> 0:1:39.627
We can't make
this personal, sir.

40
0:1:39.660 --> 0:1:40.929
Personal?

41
0:1:40.962 --> 0:1:43.865
Agent, we can't stand by
and let folks like him die.

42
0:1:43.898 --> 0:1:46.435
These people,
we're their only hope.

43
0:1:48.203 --> 0:1:50.039
Now, we have
to find that antidote.

44
0:1:50.072 --> 0:1:52.675
Poppy's stockpiles, well,
they could be anywhere.

45
0:1:52.708 --> 0:1:54.643
HARRY:
She must have some on hand.

46
0:1:54.676 --> 0:1:56.245
Locate Poppy...

47
0:1:57.378 --> 0:2:0.114
and obtain a sample
for analysis.

48
0:2:0.148 --> 0:2:2.016
Maybe it can be replicated.

49
0:2:2.050 --> 0:2:3.517
GINGER: Sorry to cut in, guys.

50
0:2:3.551 --> 0:2:5.087
But Charlie is on the phone
with his girlfriend.

51
0:2:5.119 --> 0:2:7.354
Looping you in now.

52
0:2:7.387 --> 0:2:8.957
CLARA: Don't worry.
I'm on a payphone...

53
0:2:8.989 --> 0:2:11.592
covered in a fucking blue rash.

54
0:2:11.626 --> 0:2:12.927
Why didn't you tell me?

55
0:2:12.961 --> 0:2:15.530
All you said was,
"Don't take any drugs."

56
0:2:15.564 --> 0:2:17.966
It was a music festival
for fuck's sake.

57
0:2:17.998 --> 0:2:22.070
Fuck. Shit. Shit! Okay.

58
0:2:23.204 --> 0:2:25.273
Listen. You need to get
to the lab in Italy.

59
0:2:25.306 --> 0:2:26.809
Do you remember
where we went skiing?

60
0:2:26.841 --> 0:2:29.310
Yes. Yes, I remember.

61
0:2:29.345 --> 0:2:30.679
Yeah. Meet me there

62
0:2:30.712 --> 0:2:32.413
and I'll give you the antidote.

63
0:2:32.447 --> 0:2:33.748
(SIGHS)

64
0:2:33.782 --> 0:2:35.083
Okay.

65
0:2:38.919 --> 0:2:40.755
All right. Jet's ready.

66
0:2:40.788 --> 0:2:43.324
Whiskey, Galahad, get to Italy.

67
0:2:47.294 --> 0:2:49.197
You two need to fix
this code name thing.

68
0:2:49.230 --> 0:2:50.765
And with all due respect, sir...

69
0:2:50.798 --> 0:2:52.100
I don't think Galahad senior

70
0:2:52.133 --> 0:2:53.668
is ready to return to fieldwork.

71
0:2:54.770 --> 0:2:57.038
I did actually mean...
Of course.

72
0:2:57.072 --> 0:2:59.641
And with all disrespect...

73
0:2:59.675 --> 0:3:1.443
I'm not going anywhere
without him.
