- please call and let me know.
- Okay.

173

I must stress...

that Will should not be left alone
for longer than 15 minutes.

You might want to wear something
a little less revealing.

Oh, yes, of course.

This is the annex.

Um, I'll give you a set of car keys,

And there is always food
in the fridge.

186
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,400
You and Will can work out
your level of interaction yourselves.

Um, obviously...

188
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,521
Well, I would hope that
you could get on.

189
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,728
It would be nice if he could
think of you as a friend

190

rather than a paid professional.

191

No.
