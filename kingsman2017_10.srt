1
0:0:4.042 --> 0:0:5.110
Arthur.

2
0:0:8.714 --> 0:0:9.915
Oh, fuck.

3
0:0:15.719 --> 0:0:17.355
POPPY: Yep.

4
0:0:17.389 --> 0:0:20.793
Kingsman is crumpets.

5
0:0:22.459 --> 0:0:26.364
Like toast, but British.

6
0:0:26.398 --> 0:0:28.065
And to say thank you...

7
0:0:28.099 --> 0:0:30.669
I got you a present, Charlie.

8
0:0:30.701 --> 0:0:35.740
My guys made you this.

9
0:0:37.842 --> 0:0:42.447
Bigger, badder, better.
I call it...

10
0:0:42.480 --> 0:0:45.016
ARMageddon.

11
0:0:51.223 --> 0:0:52.758
(WHIRRING)

12
0:1:4.236 --> 0:1:6.170
Let's see if your game improves.

13
0:1:19.083 --> 0:1:20.318
Ouch.

14
0:1:58.223 --> 0:2:0.024
EGGSY: Someone decides
to wipe out

15
0:2:0.057 --> 0:2:1.859
every Kingsman property...

16
0:2:1.892 --> 0:2:4.262
every agent, and somehow...

17
0:2:4.295 --> 0:2:7.064
conveniently,
you weren't at home.

18
0:2:7.098 --> 0:2:8.867
I could say the same thing
about you.

19
0:2:8.900 --> 0:2:11.268
What, you think I'd kill Roxy?

20
0:2:11.302 --> 0:2:14.139
And my mate, Brandon,
and my fucking dog?

21
0:2:14.171 --> 0:2:15.173
MERLIN: No.

22
0:2:17.507 --> 0:2:18.843
You think I would?

23
0:2:23.380 --> 0:2:25.851
This thing...

24
0:2:26.784 --> 0:2:29.152
hacked us.

25
0:2:29.187 --> 0:2:31.556
Clearly, this arm can be
remotely controlled.

26
0:2:32.823 --> 0:2:34.158
I'm only alive
because my address

27
0:2:34.191 --> 0:2:36.394
wasn't on the database
with the agents.

28
0:2:37.262 --> 0:2:38.563
Whoever Charlie's working with

29
0:2:38.596 --> 0:2:43.334
doesn't think that mere
staff are missile-worthy.

30
0:2:44.334 --> 0:2:45.769
This ain't funny.

31
0:2:45.804 --> 0:2:47.906
Roxy is dead!

32
0:2:47.938 --> 0:2:50.074
Everyone's dead! Gone!
Do you even care?

33
0:2:50.108 --> 0:2:51.643
Pull yourself together.

34
0:2:51.676 --> 0:2:54.111
Remember your training.

35
0:2:54.144 --> 0:2:56.047
There's no time for emotion
in this scenario.

36
0:2:59.484 --> 0:3:0.585
Now...
