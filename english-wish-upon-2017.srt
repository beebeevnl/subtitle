01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:32,760
I found these. I don't know
what you could use them for.

1296
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:35,910
Maybe around the house?
I don't know, they're kind of neat.

1297
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,998
- Yeah, I can do something with these.
- Yeah?

You gotta come with us again.

Yeah, maybe I will.

Okay, um...

1310
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:24,032
First off, I just wanted to say, um...

1311
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:27,030
I'm sorry for the whole McFarts thing.

1312
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:28,876
Wait. What? Really?

1313

Yeah. Um...

1314
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:33,953
But you know what, maybe in the
multiverse, that didn't happen.

- Hold on, you dig on multiverses?
- Yeah.

1316
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:40,951
And, also, maybe in the multiverse,
we're really good friends.

1317
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:43,711
Maybe... we're even dating.

1318
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:47,637
Well... have we done it?

1319
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:49,476
No, not yet.

1320
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:54,470
I have also met your cousin, Gina.
Hung out in her loft and everything.

1321
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:57,911
Okay, you're freaking me out right now.

1322
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:58,990
Yeah, good.

1323

please don't open this.

1326
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,674
Just... just bury it. No shortcuts.

1327
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:13,559
Uh... okay.

1328
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:15,790
What's in it for me?

1329

Dinner, if you want?

1330
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:23,073
And maybe we could talk more
on this whole multiverse thing?

1331
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:29,034
Yeah, and you can tell me how you
know my cousin and that she has a loft.
