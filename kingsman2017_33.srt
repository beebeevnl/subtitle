You have any reconnaissance
drones down in Asia?

2
0:0:3.910 --> 0:0:5.579
GINGER: Sure do.
Sending them in right now.

NEWS ANCHOR 1:
The government today urged.

4
0:0:13.954 --> 0:0:15.122
Golden Circle victims...

5
0:0:15.154 --> 0:0:17.090
to report to
the temporary field hospitals

6
0:0:17.123 --> 0:0:19.993
now set up across the country.

7
0:0:20.026 --> 0:0:21.828
NEWS ANCHOR 2: The president's
handling of the crisis

8
0:0:21.861 --> 0:0:24.632
has been commended
by other world leaders.

9
0:0:24.666 --> 0:0:27.401
Damn. Politics has
never been so easy.

10
0:0:27.435 --> 0:0:29.570
Oh, Jesus, Fox.

11
0:0:29.602 --> 0:0:30.904
What?

12
0:0:38.846 --> 0:0:40.215
Oh, God.

13
0:0:44.952 --> 0:0:46.119
Like I said, sir...

14
0:0:46.153 --> 0:0:48.856
this affects all people
from all backgrounds.

15
0:0:48.889 --> 0:0:50.690
I'm disappointed, Fox.

16
0:0:50.724 --> 0:0:52.592
Disappointed and disgusted.

17
0:0:52.626 --> 0:0:55.630
Mr. President,
I routinely work

18
0:0:55.663 --> 0:0:58.098
a 20 hour day for you,
7 days a week.

19
0:0:58.132 --> 0:1:1.269
Maybe some can do that
without chemical help.

20
0:1:1.301 --> 0:1:4.438
Countless people
are going to die.

21
0:1:4.471 --> 0:1:6.106
You can save them, sir.

22
0:1:7.007 --> 0:1:8.610
Innocent people like me.

23
0:1:10.977 --> 0:1:12.881
Not that innocent.

24
0:1:15.617 --> 0:1:16.618
(CLICKS TONGUE)

25
0:1:43.377 --> 0:1:44.512
He looks great.

26
0:1:44.544 --> 0:1:45.579
Good.

27
0:1:50.917 --> 0:1:52.285
Good news, gentlemen.

28
0:1:52.319 --> 0:1:53.921
He'll be back on
his feet in no time.

29
0:1:53.954 --> 0:1:55.922
I'm not certain
that's a good idea.

30
0:1:55.956 --> 0:1:57.057
What do you mean?

31
0:1:57.091 --> 0:1:59.127
I shot Agent Whiskey.
Deliberately.

32
0:1:59.560 --> 0:2:0.660
What, why?

33
0:2:0.694 --> 0:2:1.895
He was working against us.

34
0:2:1.930 --> 0:2:4.030
And until we find out why,
I say we trust no one.

35
0:2:4.064 --> 0:2:6.199
Merlin, Harry's sick.

36
0:2:6.233 --> 0:2:8.101
This whole thing is my fault.

37
0:2:8.135 --> 0:2:9.636
I thought he was ready.

38
0:2:9.669 --> 0:2:11.338
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
(SIGHS)

39
0:2:14.941 --> 0:2:17.511
I'm sorry,
I've got to take this.

40
0:2:17.544 --> 0:2:18.945
Listen to me.

41
0:2:18.979 --> 0:2:20.581
This is not about
my mental health.

42
0:2:20.614 --> 0:2:23.217
If there's a chance there's
a double agent in our midst...

43
0:2:23.249 --> 0:2:27.921
or worse, if Statesman itself
has a dark agenda...

44
0:2:27.954 --> 0:2:29.622
we have to safeguard
this mission.

45
0:2:29.655 --> 0:2:33.593
We both know the president
wants these victims dead.

46
0:2:33.627 --> 0:2:34.995
(CHUCKLES) Hey, baby.

47
0:2:35.029 --> 0:2:36.431
(CHUCKLES)

48
0:2:36.963 --> 0:2:38.198
Hey.

49
0:2:38.798 --> 0:2:40.501
(PRINCESS TILDE LAUGHS)

50
0:2:40.533 --> 0:2:41.467
Fuck.

51
0:2:41.501 --> 0:2:44.304
Look, Harry, I trust you.
I always have.

52
0:2:44.337 --> 0:2:48.941
But it's about this situation.
We need Statesman's resources.

53
0:2:48.975 --> 0:2:51.043
And I need to know
that you are fit for work.

54
0:2:51.078 --> 0:2:52.813
Babe, why didn't you call me?

55
0:2:52.846 --> 0:2:54.347
Are you the banana man?

56
0:2:54.381 --> 0:2:55.883
Listen, we're on
the verge of finding

57
0:2:55.916 --> 0:2:57.517
an antidote.
It's gonna be all right.

58
0:2:57.551 --> 0:2:58.419
Now, look left for me.

59
0:2:58.452 --> 0:2:59.720
There's nothing wrong
with my brain.

60
0:2:59.753 --> 0:3:1.220
Look right.
