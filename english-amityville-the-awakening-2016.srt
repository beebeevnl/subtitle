In 1965, Ronald DeFeo moved his family

from Brooklyn into a beautiful three-story

they even put a sign in front

So I gave up on God.

868

once again at 112 Ocean Avenue

1100
01:21:22,253 --> 01:21:24,755
in Amityville, Long Island,
the infamous house

1101
01:21:24,881 --> 01:21:30,511
where Ronnie DeFeo killed his entire family
with a shotgun, more than four decades ago.

1102
01:21:30,636 --> 01:21:32,763
Police are questioning
17-year-old Belle Walker

1103
01:21:32,889 --> 01:21:36,642
as a person of interest in the
brutal murders of her aunt Candice,

1104
01:21:36,767 --> 01:21:39,979
her mother Joan, and the death
of her brother James.

1105
01:21:40,104 --> 01:21:43,482
Miss Walker claims that her
brother committed the crimes,

1106
01:21:43,608 --> 01:21:47,153
and her story has been corroborated
by her seven-year-old sister Juliet.

1107
01:21:47,278 --> 01:21:50,865
A spokesman for the Amityville Police
Department said that forensic evidence

1108
01:21:50,990 --> 01:21:53,576
does point to James as the killer.

1109
01:21:53,701 --> 01:21:56,621
His fingerprints were found
on the murder weapon.

1110
01:21:56,746 --> 01:21:58,915
But Dr. Ken Milton refutes that claim,

1111
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:01,834
stating that James Walker was
too weak to get out of bed,

1112
01:22:01,959 --> 01:22:04,337
let alone stalk his
entire family with a shotgun.

1113
01:22:04,462 --> 01:22:06,505
For two years prior to the murders,

James was in a coma, a vegetative state.
