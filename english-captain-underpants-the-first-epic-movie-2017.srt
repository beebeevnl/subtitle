A long, long,
long, long time ago...

00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,595
in a galaxy far, far away...

8
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,836
there was a planet called
Underpantyworld.

GEORGE: That's perfect.
That's perfect. Okay.

12
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,396
Underpantyworld was
a peaceful planet

13
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,670
where everybody wore
only underwear.

14
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,236
Until it started to blow up
for some reason.

Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
Da-da.

16
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,670
GEORGE: Meanwhile, the leaders
of Underpantyworld...

17
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,434
Big Daddy Longjohns and his
wife, Princess Pantyhose...

18
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,669
...saved their baby

19
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,677
by stretching his underwear
really far...

20
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,160
and then
they shot him into space.

21
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,952
Godspeed, little Underpants.

22

Whee!

24
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,114
And then he crashed on Earth,

25
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,872
where he was raised
by some nice...

done an origin issue ages ago.

Well, that brings our story
to its happy conclusion.

332
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,520
I hope you've all
enjoyed the film.

333
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,278
It was certainly shorter
than we expected.

334
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,629
What more is there to say?

335
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,995
Our fellow students got

they are legally entitled to.

once and for...

Oh, boys! A moment, please.

339
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,713
What's happening to his face?

340
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,195
I think he's smiling.

341
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,032
(SHIVERS) I'm so cold.

342
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,551
So, so cold.

343
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,029
I'll let myself in,
receptionist lady.

344
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,680
Melvin.

345
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,875
What's he doing here?

346
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,191
You see, Melvin
is yet to demonstrate...

347
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,999
his most impressive invention
from today.

348
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,430
It was a little
extracurricular project

349
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,715
I asked him
to come up with myself.

350
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,678
I call him
the Tattle Turtle 200.

351
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,513
On the outside,
it resembles a turtle.

352
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,353
But on the inside,
oh, look at this.

353
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,509
It's a nanny cam!

354
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,950
Oh, Melvin. How fun.

355
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,031
Let's see what it recorded.

356
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,871
Yeah, you gotta change
the input to video.

357
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,040
I think I got this.

358
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,599
You're on AUX.
Change it to video.

359
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,795
It's not my TV.

360
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,216
It's your turtle.
You're doing it wrong.

361
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,309
I know.

362
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,914

00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,753
really has good
picture quality.

really tell that's us.

I can't believe it.
I gotcha. (LAUGHS)

I finally gotcha!

I told you
I would get you one day.

381
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,279
And that day
I was talking about

382
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,588
is this day.

Today. This is the day.

Are you going to tell
our parents?

385
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,434
No. Your parents are obviously
total failures.

386
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,149
I have a much more effective
punishment in mind.

You can't do this. Please.

they'll remain besties.

And before we know it,

420
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,560
separate classes
will lead to separate lives...

421

which inevitably
leads to robots.

at the mall?

Captain Underpants,
get out here.

820
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,040
Sidekicks...

821
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,200
are you sure

822
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,038
my secret identity
requires these...

823
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:47,353
restricting,
uncomfortable clothes?

824
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,560
Yes, positive.

825
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,518
100% positive.
Now act like a principal.

826
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:52,715
Oh, right.

827
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,354
How does a principal act?

828
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,480
Mean!

829
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,555

00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,519
I'm a principal!

833
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,040
Oh, yeah. That's great.

834
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,193
Come on. We're almost there.

835
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,720
(ALL SHRIEK)

836
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,836
Oh, hello. Surprise.

837
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,033
It's Edith.

838
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,191
Did you like
my tuna casserole?

839
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,677
I cannot lie.

840
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,394
I don't recall
having your tuna casserole.

841
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,357
What? Oh.

842
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,919
But if your casserole is

843
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:25,237
as striking
as your one blue eye...

844
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,359
Oh, I didn't think
you noticed.

845
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,760
Oh, my.

846
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,916

Principal Krupp.
It's time to go.

850
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,709
Gotta wrap it up.

851
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,029
Very well then.

852
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,389
Up, up, and...

853
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,551
And this way, sir.

854
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,713
Ooh! Flirt alert.

855
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,233
A-ha!

856
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,839
Wow, she's still on hold.

(MUSIC PLAYING)
(LAUGHING)

858
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,232
Phew! We made it.

859
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,118
Well, hello, citizen.
What?

860
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,320
Oh, and hello to you, too.

861
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,431
I was just, like,
admiring the view...

862
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,238
from your broken window.

863
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,118
It's in the shape of a man.

864
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,480
Anyway, I am here to interview

865
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,113
for the science teacher
position.

866
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,633
Perfect. I'm disguised

867
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,193
as an elementary
school principal.

868
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,280
(BOTH SIGH)

869
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,913

Guys, I totally got this.

870
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,593
Don't worry one bit.

871
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,074
Now, where did I put
that resume?

872
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,376
No, not that. Oh, this thing.

873

(GASPING)

874
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,440
This one's fun.

00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,794
Ooh!
Heads up.

876
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,399
That one's gonna leave a mark.

877
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,913
I've been looking for that.

878

(WHIMPERS)
Oh, not that.

879
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,789
Ah-ha! Here we go.

(BOTH SIGH)

881
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,077
Hmm. Says here
you're a science teacher?

882
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,434
Not exactly.

883
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,591
But you have
teaching experience?

884
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,119
Oh, no, I can't say that I do.

885
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,391
Not even, like, babysitting?

886
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,788
I would never sit on a baby.

887
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,960
Camp counselor?

888
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,394
Never was a camp counselor.

889
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,079
Although
I did receive counseling...

890
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,471
for some trauma I experienced
as a child.

891
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,468
I'm getting a really good vibe
about you.

892
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,596
Now hold on.
Let me see that resume.

893
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,955
It says here that you were
a genius inventor?

894
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,314
Mad...

895
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,990
genius inventor.
But yes.

896
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,111
And then for
the last few years...

897
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,952
you've "been in
a very dark place"...

898
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,354
and your title was...

899
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,431
"Revenge Seeker?"

900
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,953
"Revenge at all costs...

901
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,120
"Die! Die!"

902
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,280
Am I reading this right?

903
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,510
Yeah, that's basically
what I've been up to...

904
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,432
so here I am!

905
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,749
Applying for a job in

906
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,308

public school system...

with all of
its amazing resources.

908
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,033
But honestly,
kids are so understanding.

909
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,792
So innocent.

910
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,952
Their smiles brighten my heart
and fill me with...

911
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:41,032
a joy-adjacent feeling.

912
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,509
As long
as they are controlled...

913
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,478
and do not laugh
nor smile nor play nor laugh.

914
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,198
Children must never laugh!

915
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,831
Well, you seem terrific!

916
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,149

919
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,077
and every other Tuesday
through Thursday...

920
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,514
for my evil experiments.

921
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,353
Hope that's not a problem.
Okay, bye-bye!

922
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,069
Oh, this is bad.

923
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,515
We just hired a maniac
for a science teacher!

924
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,035
Uh, yeah. We gotta fix this
before Krupp finds out.

925
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,317
Sounds like a job
for Captain Underpants.

926
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,710
No, no, no.
You need to stay here.

927
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,393
Okay, you're
the principal, remember?

928
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,875
Yeah, just sit there
and look angry for no reason.

929
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,190
You got it. Grr...

00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,720
Ooh!

931
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,356
That will be interesting
to put my eye up to.

932
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,910
(YELLS) What?
How did I get here?

that you could change...

if I had to change one thing
about the world...

953
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,955
it would be to get rid of...

wants to do that?

I've tried to shrink it

or cut it out entirely...

978

but frustratingly,

979
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,512
our survival seems
dependent upon it.

980
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,795
I don't like this. I mean,
I don't really understand it.

00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,200
But the stuff
I am understanding

982
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,514
seems genuinely bad to me.

983
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,874

1468
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:10,069
What is happening?

1469
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:11,753
I hope this works.

1470
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,433
Tra-la-laaa!

1471
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:14,675
Ow! Ow!

(GROANS)

1473
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,856
Keep standing down.
I'm just gonna be a second.

1474
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:19,233
(YELLS) Ow.

1475
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:21,831
I bet he thought
that was going to be cooler.

1476
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,752
Oh, boy. Here goes nothing.

1477
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:25,029
Ha-ha!

1478
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:26,753
Prepare to be vanquished...

1479
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:28,273
and justice to be served

1480
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:31,039
on a piping hot
platter of freedom!

1481
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,758
With a side order
of liberty...

1482
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:36,629
and a super-sized cup
filled with freedom also!

1483
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:39,274
Impressive use
of fast-food analogies,

1484
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,595
you giant baby with a cape on!

1485
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,119
Let's do this.

Freeze! The following sequence
contains scenes...

1491
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:05,776
that are so intense,
horrific, and violent...

1492
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:06,800
And expensive.

1493
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:09,136
...that we can only show it
using a technology known as...

1494
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:11,276
Flip-O-Rama!

1495
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:12,555
Take it away, Harold.

1496
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,216
HAROLD: Okay,
first Professor Poopypants

1497
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,416
gave Captain Underpants
the boot.

1498
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,714
GEORGE: Foot! Foot! Ow!

1499
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:18,536
HAROLD: Then he made
an Underpants sandwich.

1500
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:19,896
GEORGE:
Punch, punch! Punch, punch!

1501
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:22,136
HAROLD: And then, they played
a friendly game of paddleball!

1502
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:23,912
Oh, no!

1503
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:25,080
Darn.

1504
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:27,071
Okay, what's next?
Oh, yes!

1505
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:30,073
Then, Poopypants summoned
an army of dolphins...

1506
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:31,296
GEORGE: Wait, what?
Why are you always

1507
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:32,576
sneaking dolphins
into the movie?

1508
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:33,896
HAROLD: What do you have
against dolphins anyway?

1509
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:35,216
GEORGE: I don't have nothing
against dolphins,

1510
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:36,976
it just didn't happen!
HAROLD: Well, so what?

1511
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,639
We get to say what happened.
It's the Flip-O-Rama.

1512
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:41,791
I like dolphins.
The dolphins are in.

1513
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:43,896
GEORGE: Fine, all right.
Let's just keep going.

1514
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,056
HAROLD: You sure?
GEORGE: Yep, positive.

1515
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:46,080
HAROLD: Thank you.

1516
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:48,496
Anyway, Poopypants didn't realize it...
GEORGE: Quiet five, quiet five.

1517
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:50,801
...but George and Harold's plan
was working out perfectly.

1518
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:52,896
(GEORGE VOCALIZING) So, they
shot themselves to the top

1519
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:54,353
of the Turbo Toilet 2000!

1520
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:56,829
To keep things dramatic,
they didn't quite make it.

1521
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:58,758
And then...
And then...

1522
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
And then...

1523
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:01,598
What happened
to the Flip-O-Rama?

1524
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:02,875
I ran outta paper.

1525

(MELVIN MEDITATING)

Hey, Melvin!
Take that thing off your head.

1528
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:09,880
We gotta stop Poopypants!

1529
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,713
(GASPS) Professor Poopypants!

1530
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:14,030
George and Harold
are trying to stop you!

1531
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:17,112
(GROANS)
You are just so annoying!

1532
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:21,272
So, you two
little numbskulls thought

1533
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:22,469
you could distract me...

1534
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:25,712
with this idiotic, naked man.
Am I right?

1535
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:27,836
I'm not naked!

1536
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:32,198
Any final words before this
whole revenge thing goes down?

1538
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:35,513
Yeah, wait, wait. Listen.

01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:38,069
We apologize
for making fun of your name.

1540
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:40,549
I mean, that was just wrong.

1541
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:44,554
Yeah, we're sorry.
The truth is, Professor P...

1542
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,073
you have probably, like,

1543
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:47,991
the greatest name
we've ever heard.

1544
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:50,520
I mean, George, imagine
if we had names like that.

1545
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:52,312
Oh, that would be so cool!

1546

Okay, wait, let's do it.
Let's try it.

Oh, I would be
Fluffy Toiletnose.

isn't that people
laugh at you.

01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:54,479
I mean,
he's a way bigger problem

1787
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:55,879
than Mr. Krupp ever was.

1788

in the same class again.

Yeah, I know.

1792
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:11,548
But just 'cause we're
in separate classes,

1793
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:13,232
doesn't mean
we can't be friends...

1794
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:17,755
Well, yeah. I mean, we'll
always be friends. Right?

Yeah. Hey, in fact,
you know what?

1796
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:21,595
Let's do a blood oath.

But minus the blood. I don't
wanna see the blood. No blood.

and Captain Underpants
so happy?

1852

Maybe it's because
Captain Underpants had us.

You know, he had friends.

That freaky, bald dude
in his underwear

1949
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:17,670
He'll drop those trousers and
he'll fight to save the day

The day, the day

Oh, there he goes

Here he comes
in his tighty-whities

All the bad guys

Hey, who's that hunk?

1957
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:37,318
Is that cotton pre-shrunk?

1958
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:38,400
Na, na, na, na, na

1959

Captain Underpants
Yeah, yeah, yeah

MAN: It's time to fly again!

1961
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:45,991
Suspend your disbelief

1962
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:48,911
He'll save the world
in his briefs

No way!

Right from the start
couldn't pull us apart

It just works

1994
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:58,832
Nobody else ever
gets me as well on this earth

1995
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:03,832
Like Rock and Roll
My shows and tellies

Mac and cheese
PBs and jellies

You're my brother from another

Another mother

2003

Like the sun and the moon

2011

All the best things
come in twos

2012
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,959
What would I do

Laugh till we cry when we're

Even our fights always end
with a smile on our face

2021
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:13,552
Like black and white keys
On a Wurli

2022

Saturday, eh, eh, eh

2107
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:25,037
Hey...

2108
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:28,592
The perfect day

2109
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,638
On Saturday

2110
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:43,237
Take your bag
and leave your house

2111
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:45,271
Don't need no TV
to be entertained

2112
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:46,554
We are the show

2113
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:49,677
Come now and play it subtle
Bring back all that we know

2114
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:53,356
Our songs the only thing
that's playing on the radio

2115
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:59,315
On Saturday, Saturday

2116
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:02,557
The sun has shined
on us, hey, hey, hey, hey

2117
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:04,995
I think it's time for a break

2118
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:08,275
We'll get away, get away

2119
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:11,557
The perfect day

2120
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:18,316
The perfect day

2121
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:21,870
We got nowhere we need to be

2122
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:24,918
On Saturday, Saturday
