00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:35,830
your sins are no different
from those of vampires.

103
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:38,960

Vampires exist.

109
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,580
It's because you're not busy.

113
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:41,910
Such a pity that you think
the world is so puny.

114
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:46,210
In 1742, a report was made

115
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,540
about Scholar Choi and his servant.

116
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:53,080
The servant saw a mysterious light.

117
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,040
Then Choi vanished without a trace.

118
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,490

119
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,370

unbelievable incidents.

120
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,370
Who's to say vampires don't exist?

121
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,000
Do you have proof?

122
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,700
30 years ago,

123
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,160
a Westerners' ship headed for
China ran aground in Joseon.

124
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,200
There are records of
vampire sightings then.

125
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,320
Come on, sir.

126
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:32,160
Cut the nonsense and do
your detective work.

127
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,240
Aren't you paying me rent?

128
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:38,250
Stop roaming and go back
to your nice house.

129
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:40,120
Then I'll have to get married!

130
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,080
If you must, why not?

131
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:53,500
I don't wish to marry without love.

132
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,910
Then tell your father that.

133
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:59,500
- He decided who I'll marry.
- So what?

134
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:03,710
You're good at speaking your mind.
Can't you talk to your father?

135
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,240
It's your life, sir!

136
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,370
Just say no!

137
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:11,990
Say you're not marrying a
stranger without love.

138
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,080
I did!

139
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,160
I told him it's my life and
he can't decide for me.

140
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,700
And?

141
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:19,870
I got slapped.

142
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:23,960
He's firm.

143
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,870
I thought the Premier would be different.

144
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,080

Anticipation for the Full Moon Fest

146
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:34,910
is high throughout Joseon.

147
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:39,700
People of all ages are working hard

148
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:48,490
to prepare a greater fest than
the one 30 years ago, sir.

149
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:58,420
Recently, 10,000 people worked
on fortifying our forts.

150
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,750
It must be hard for them to work
for the Full Moon Fest too.

151
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:10,830
Thus, I shall grant a small reward
to the workers.

152
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:15,080
Set rice as the only tributary.

153
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:20,030
And have aristocrats pay
for the military cloth as well.

154
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:29,290
I, Premier Kim Shin, request
to speak, Your Majesty.

155
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:35,580
His Majesty's mercy and heart
for the people is like heaven.

156
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:36,870
However,

157
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:41,160
if aristocrats pay the same as peasants,

158
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,990
what makes them different, sir?

159
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:47,570
It'll destroy class distinction

160
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,750
and shake the basis of Joseon, sir.

161
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:53,920
Please, Your Majesty!

162
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:57,920
Please retract your command, sir!

163
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:03,040
Even the king can't have his way with him.

164
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,330
Any functional problems in getting married?

165
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:09,580
Why you little!

166
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:11,500
Excuse me.

167
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:39,410
Who?

168
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,790
It's scorched rice tea.

169
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:51,960
Thank you.

170
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:54,530
It has a rich, deep flavor.

171
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,450
I did a great job making it.

172
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,580
Let me introduce myself.

173
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,450
I'm the daughter of the
owner of Yeon-mi Lodge.

174
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:09,740
How could we be of help?

175
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:13,120
Recently, while repairing
building in Ganghwa,

176
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:17,160
the roof suddenly caved
in and many workers died.

177
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:22,790
While burying the dead,
two corpses were discovered.

178
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:27,540
One was a skeleton and
the other was burned.

179
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,210
However, the burnt one
wasn't decayed at all.

180
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,370
But that's not all!

181
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:36,240
While they went to report it,

182
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,290
The corpse disappeared!

183
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,240
Only the burnt corpse vanished!

184
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:44,210
Then another incident happened soon after.

185
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,750
It was quite peculiar.

186
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:51,250
Some say a man burned
to death by an invisible fire.

187
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:53,830
He died but was not dead.

188
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,500
He lived but did not live!

189
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:59,910
Some say it's the revenge of those
who died in the Ganghwa Hall fire.

190
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,370
The Full Moon Fest is taking
place after 30 years.

191
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:08,660
My father has been ordered
by the court to prepare it.

192
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,660
However, he is ill and can't
see to such problems.

193
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,080
I've come to ask you to
solve the mysteries for us.

194
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,660
It won't be easy.

195
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,910
Serial killings can't be ruled out.

196
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:27,040
I heard you are the best
in all of Joseon, sir.

197
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,450
I'm not the best.

198
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:36,240
I'm the best of the best!

199
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,660
It's sad that I can only
explain myself that way.

200
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,790
He's a little arrogant.

201
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:42,990
I see.

202
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,080
Let's talk accommodations.

203
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,700
Will it have two rooms
or one with living room?

204
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,410
One with living room, sir.

205
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:51,580
Inside bathroom or outside?

206
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,540
Inside, sir.

207
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:53,500
And breakfast?

208
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,750
Provided, sir.

209
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,040

The guest door is that way.

218
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,750
The owner's daughter asked me to come.

219
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:46,960
I'm a detective.

220
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:49,820
It's about the mysterious deaths here.

221
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,240
Your sister asked us to
come and investigate.

222
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:55,750
I don't know why she did that.

223
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,990
I don't know of such things.

225
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,160
He's a very famous detective, sir.

226
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,330
He solved the fake silver case and
even had dinner with the king.

227
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,210
I don't think he knows.

228
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,410
What if I explain it like this?

229
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:32,250
He got drunk before His Majesty and said,

230
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,660
'This isn't your country, pal!'

231
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,830
After the rude fiasco,
he was sent into exile.

232
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,330
That's him.

233
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:43,370
He's Premier Kim Shin's...

Or is it horse dung?

240
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,540
What is this, a barn?

241
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:06,790
It's not what she promised.

almost peed on the way!

00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:26,450
Shouldn't they give us fried eggs at least?

This is why you don't make
deals with a middleman.

A man died by the same fire last night.

What is the Full Moon Fest that
the magistrate can't investigate?

262
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:19,620
In the past, royal officials
would all gather to celebrate.

His Majesty will be coming this time.

264

by looking at the corpse,

00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:28,330

- It's mine.

Don't tamper with the crime scene!

Do you know what's the most painful death?

293
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,460
Burning to death.

294
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:50,540
But the way he died shows no
sign of squirming in pain.

295
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:55,710
It means that he couldn't
move before he was burned.

00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:01,170
- An invisible fire...
- And...

Stay out, servant.

320
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:52,210
The Buddhist monk on the poster?

321
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,490
Did anyone come for his body?

322

You're the first to come for him.

323
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:01,330
So, all you know is that
he's a Buddhist monk?

324
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:03,790
Why do you ask that?

325
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:05,080
Very well then.

326
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,160
Wait! Show me your identity tag!

327
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,120
Who are you, sir?

328
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:21,160
Didn't Sir Choi Jae-kyung mention us?

329
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,660
You're the detective from the capital?

330
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,410
Yes.

There's no case I can't solve.

332
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:28,830
- I'm the best detective in...
- Excuse me, sir.

333
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:32,960
Where did she go?

334
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:37,830
I wish to see Song Pil-geun's corpse.

335
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:39,330
That's impossible, sir.

336
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:42,160
The magistrate gave orders
never to show it to anyone.

337
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,450
Of course not! If the magistrate said so.

338
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:51,710
On second thought, maybe
he didn't say never.

339
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:54,070
There is no such thing as never.

340
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:58,910
- You could sneak a peek at night.
- Good.

341
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,460
- I'll come back at night.
- Yes, sir.

342
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:06,830
What did you draw, sir?

343
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:12,250
Isn't she the woman from before?

344
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,490
That lady...

345
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,700
Did you notice?

346
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,120
Well,

347
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,910
she was a bit odd and very strong.

348
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:21,990
She's gorgeous.

349
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,040
Not again.

350
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:27,030
Why draw a pretty woman
at a time like this?

351
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,000
I need it to investigate.

352
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,210
Investigate what?

353
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,080
If you want to meet her, just say it.

354
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,620
She's there wherever we go!

355
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:39,370
That means she's connected
to this case somehow.

356
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:43,750
- Then...
- Maybe...

357
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:47,370
She could be chasing us.

358
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,490
Us? Why, sir?

359
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,410
Sir! It's me!

360
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:57,240
You must find out who she is
and why she's after this case.

361
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,750
Yes, sir.

362
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:03,500
This rough chap looks suspicious.

363
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:06,000
It's a woman.

364
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,660
And she's pretty.

365
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:14,160
Are you going blind in your old age?

366
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:16,790
Forget it.

367
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:19,420
I'll find her. You can go back home.

368
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:20,450
No, sir!

369
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:24,030
I'll find this fool! I mean this woman!

370
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,830
Look.

371
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:34,450
There is soot in his nose.

372
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,740
He was burned when he was alive.

373
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:11,740
It appears we're here for the same purpose.

374
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:18,950
Would you like to take a look?

375
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:22,280
Or shall we fight and bring in the guards?

376
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:40,200
An invisible fire...

377
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:46,580
It seems he was fatally
wounded before burning.

378
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:49,450
Then the scar must be somewhere.

379
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:01,620
<i>While burying the dead,
two corpses were discovered.</i>

380
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:04,290
<i>The burnt one wasn't decayed at all.</i>

381
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,780
<i>Only the burnt corpse vanished!</i>

382
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:40,200
<i>Is it a real vampire?</i>

383
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:43,620
<i>The arrow precisely struck the heart.</i>

384
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:48,040
<i>He didn't just want the
blood, but to kill him.</i>

385
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:50,790
<i>'Yeom' means to stain.</i>

386
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:54,330
<i>Why did the killer leave a sign?</i>

387
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,490
<i>Perhaps a forewarned murder?</i>

388
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:01,660
This letter has something
to do with staining or dyes.

389
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:05,790
Go to the painting plant and
meet the painters for clues.

390
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:08,620
I'll search the dye house here.

391
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:16,200
<i>HA BYUNG-EUN</i>

392
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,040
Why are you here?

393
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:52,250
How long will you follow me?

394
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:56,460
I saw someone on fire too.

395
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,080
Where?

396
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,580
I'm not sure.

397
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:07,710
I'm not sure where, who,
or why I remember that.

398
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:13,420
He must've been killed by something
that looks human but is not.

399
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,580
Something that looks human but is not?

400
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:22,540
Are they really strong and fast?

401
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:24,920
And heal fast if they're hurt?

402
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:27,040
You know about vampires?

403
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,450
Vampires?

404
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:33,500
Vampires are immortal.

405
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:38,620
They don't get hurt or die.

406
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:41,080
Immortal?

407
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:39,200
I have a question.

408
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,950
You're definitely in my memory.

409
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:45,160
Who am I?

410
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,580
In becoming a monster,
your memory was lost.

411
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:52,080
If you want your memory back,

412
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,240
drink blood.

413
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:03,700
Are you all right?

414
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,120
You fool!

415
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:09,990
How dare you disturb the
laws of this world!

416
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:13,330
I know that you're behind
the ominous deaths!

417
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:16,330
How dare you try to live
by killing innocent people!

418
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:17,920
Innocent people?

419
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:19,620
Who?

420
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,740
How dare you!

421
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,790
Think you can get away with
murder because you're immortal?

422
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,950
I know how to banish you!

423
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,660
Do you want to remember?

424
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:34,580
Then watch this!

425
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:26,200
Sir! What happened!

426
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:32,290
We must get the arrow out.
Hold him down now!

427
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:37,170
That's a good idea.

428
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:40,420
But aren't we in the same class?
Stop giving me orders!

429
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:41,450
Hurry up!

430
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:45,370
I will, but watch it.

431
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:40,740
Sir?

432
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:43,250
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

433
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:49,870
Isn't she odd, sir?

434
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:52,120
Did you sense it too?

435
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:53,370
You too, sir?

436
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:54,620
Yes.

437
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:59,120
I thought she was strange from the start.

438
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:02,370
She goes around alone.

439
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,960
She talks down to you and gives commands.

440
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,870
She's out of this world, sir.

441
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:10,870
It all adds up to one thing.

442
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:12,490
What?

443
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:14,200
She's crazy.

444
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:18,950
Crazy girls don't wear flowers
on their heads these days.

445
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:22,870
Try all you want, but you can't fool me!

446
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:31,500
<i>If you want to remember, drink blood.</i>

447
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:45,120
<i>She fought off a vampire. Is she one too?</i>

448
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,120
<i>No, she's can't be.</i>

449
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,910
<i>If she is, she can't be fine in the sun.</i>

450
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:52,160
<i>And she wouldn't have saved me.</i>

451
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,990
<i>If he catches the monster
before I find my memory...</i>

452
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,120
<i>But she's similar to him.</i>

453
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:00,660
<i>He's arrogant, but has a useful brain.</i>

454
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:02,620
<i>She's quite arrogant.</i>

455
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:05,240
<i>But her ability to fight
him is quite useful.</i>

456
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:09,750
<i>With my brain and this woman's
body, we can catch the monster.</i>

457
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:10,870
<i>Work with her?</i>

458
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,250
<i>My brain and...</i>

459
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:14,040
<i>Seo-pil's body!</i>

460
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:16,290
Damn it!

461
00:44:16,330 --> 00:44:17,580
This woman's body!

462
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:22,620
Oops. Did I say that out loud?

463
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:26,370
It's not what it sounded like.

464
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:28,700
- I mean your...
- If you help me,

465
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:30,830
I'll help you catch the monster.

466
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:31,820
But

467
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:33,700
you can't ask anything about me.

468
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:37,170
Agreed. But help you with what?

469
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,620
I lost my memory.

470
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:45,120
I want to know who I am.

471
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:46,870
Fine.

472
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:50,120
But there's one problem.

473
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:51,490
What is it?

474
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:52,710
You don't call me sir.

475
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,250
Then don't call me ma'am.

476
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:55,290
Really?

477
00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:56,330
That works.

478
00:44:57,790 --> 00:45:00,000
Wait. Maybe not.

479
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,280
Is she really crazy?

480
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:03,790
By the way,

481
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,710
how did you know the dye maker would die?

482
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:12,990
The arrowhead from Song's corpse
had a letter which means 'to stain'.

483
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:17,750
My clever head figured out
it's a clue to his next killing...

484
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:22,450
The arrowhead!

485
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:38,740
Oh no! Brother!

486
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:39,870
Who's that?

487
00:45:40,330 --> 00:45:42,370
- Must be the dead man's brother.
- What?

488
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:45,320
He only has a younger sister.

489
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:53,750
Right. He does.

490
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:57,080
Then who am I?

491
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,950
Well, I'm...

492
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:00,620
I'm his sister.

493
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:23,570
Then who is he?

494
00:46:24,830 --> 00:46:27,830
- Well, I'm her Hus...
- My servant.

495
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:30,170
His name is Bang-ja.

496
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:34,500
Greet me.

497
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,700
Hello, ma'am.

498
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:43,330
He's dressed in disguise to protect me.

499
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,950
He will be examined soon. Please be quick.

500
00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:50,240
- Of course, sir.
- Let's go.

501
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:51,790
Thank you, sir!

502
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:54,290
A servant?

503
00:46:55,990 --> 00:46:58,280
Find the arrowhead, Bang-ja.

504
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:17,700
Are you all right?

505
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:22,240
Our lady lost consciousness
from the shock of his death!

506
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:25,330
Oh no, ma'am!

507
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,580
I'm fine. Put me down.

508
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:37,370
No.

509
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:40,540
Put me down! Let me off!

510
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,080
Pretend you're asleep, will you?

511
00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:46,660
People will think it's odd if you don't.

512
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:58,120
You really don't remember anything?

513
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:00,620
I don't even know my name.

514
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,240
Then let's make one.

515
00:48:07,370 --> 00:48:08,370
My name?

516
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,580
We'll have to go around together like this.

517
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:15,990
I can't just call you 'hey you'.

518
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:20,740
And I'm an outstanding name maker.

519
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:22,990
Listen and choose.

520
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:29,920
Bertha, Dorcas, Edna, Gretel...

521
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:31,910
Don't get cute with me.

522
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,120
Let's see.

523
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:41,080
Your fair skin is like the moon.

524
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:45,410
'Wol' means 'moon'. And you're young.

525
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:47,450
How about Wol-young?

526
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:51,700
That's a pretty name.

527
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:00,660
Simplified 'A-gyo'...

528
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:04,120
It could mean someone
who makes ox hide glue.

529
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:06,870
It could also mean shinbone.

530
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:09,950
So, it could be a hunter or a butcher next.

531
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:13,000
That's so weird.

532
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:17,290
I haven't seen her eat in days.

533
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:20,990
Even if your parents die, you feel hungry.

534
00:49:21,410 --> 00:49:22,990
Why won't she eat?

535
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:25,790
I knew a crazy girl back home.

536
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:30,080
She'd run around everywhere
without eating for almost a week.

537
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:32,620
And you know how strong they are?

538
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:35,410
They can drag a couple of men no problem!

539
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:40,160
You should be careful, sir.

540
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:43,660
Don't get involved because she's pretty.

541
00:49:44,490 --> 00:49:45,490
Hi.

542
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:48,410
The flower suits you.

543
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,410
Now, let's see you smile.

544
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,040
Smile.

545
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:57,540
Don't act pretty. Just
smile like the others.

546
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,330
See? She's crazy.

547
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:05,580
- Let's go home.
- Yes, sir.

548
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,290
Hot! Hot!

549
00:51:12,330 --> 00:51:13,790
I'll protect you, sir!

550
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:37,580
Stay still!

551
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:17,910
Sir!

552
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:20,620
What about me?

553
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:33,450
Are you all right?

554
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:35,410
I'm fine.

555
00:52:35,830 --> 00:52:38,040
You got cut. How could you be fine?

556
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:40,080
- Let's see.
- It's okay.

557
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:42,250
Don't be stubborn! Give me your hand.

558
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:01,950
Who were those men?

559
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:09,370
Why change subjects? You saw it.

560
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:16,490
Some people can heal faster than others.

561
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:18,960
What if I'm not human?

562
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:24,620
What if I'm a monster like him?

563
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:33,410
You're not a monster.

564
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:37,620
Vampires can't last in the sun like you.

565
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:41,200
They crave human blood, but you don't.

566
00:53:41,490 --> 00:53:43,990
So, you're not a monster.

567
00:53:44,990 --> 00:53:46,570
What do you know?

568
00:53:52,990 --> 00:53:56,490
I can't control my powers.

569
00:53:56,950 --> 00:54:00,450
I can even sense the air
passing through me.

570
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:05,290
When I smell blood, I feel
a suffocating thirst.

571
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:07,960
At this rate,

572
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:13,620
I could bite your neck like that monster.

573
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:20,960
You may become a monster after biting me,

574
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:23,120
but my neck is fine.

575
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:27,410
Your fear of becoming a monster
means you're not one yet.

576
00:54:28,490 --> 00:54:33,740
All I see is a good person who's
afraid of becoming a monster.

577
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:38,660
Aren't you afraid of me?

578
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:43,960
I trust the human in you, Wol-young.

579
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:49,200
I trust you will not to become a monster.

580
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:54,830
You're stronger and more
upright than any man.

581
00:54:54,870 --> 00:54:57,830
I'm not afraid of you.

582
00:54:57,950 --> 00:55:01,950
I'll always keep my neck open to you.

583
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:31,370
Why don't you use the front gate?

584
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:35,910
I searched throughout Ganghwa.
I can't find her, sir.

585
00:55:36,370 --> 00:55:37,410
This is...

586
00:55:42,790 --> 00:55:44,000
No sign at all?

587
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:47,200
No, sir.

588
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:49,410
I think she left Ganghwa.

589
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:51,040
Give me that.

590
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:52,740
Look.

591
00:55:55,370 --> 00:55:56,830
Still can't find her?

592
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:02,710
Get it now?

593
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:04,120
Have you seen her?

594
00:56:05,790 --> 00:56:08,290
Forget it. Go back home.

595
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:10,170
No, sir. I'll stay and protect you.

596
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:13,870
It's okay. Just take
good care of yourself.

597
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:15,740
Then I'll be going, sir.

598
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:19,780
- Use the gate!
- Yes, sir.

599
00:56:24,450 --> 00:56:25,450
Wait.

600
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:29,240
Am I the monster in this book?

601
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:35,370
Does this look like me?

602
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:37,450
I don't look like this!

603
00:56:37,870 --> 00:56:39,620
My teeth are straight.

604
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:48,540
And it says vampires burn in the sunlight.

605
00:56:49,950 --> 00:56:50,950
But I'm fine!

606
00:56:51,830 --> 00:56:56,170
That's for vampires who
sucked human blood.

607
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:03,170
So, if I suck blood, I'd
be afraid of sunlight too?

608
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:08,070
Vampires must drink blood to survive.

609
00:57:08,410 --> 00:57:11,910
If they don't, they'll go weak.

610
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:13,620
Then

611
00:57:14,410 --> 00:57:15,660
they'll die!

612
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:19,660
Look.

613
00:57:21,290 --> 00:57:22,670
You're scared of me, right?

614
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:27,910
Yes.

615
00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:31,370
What's so funny here?

616
00:57:31,410 --> 00:57:33,490
I could hear you outside!

617
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:36,370
Think of our history together!

618
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:38,080
All those nights together!

619
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:40,580
How can you ditch me for a crazy girl?

620
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:44,200
You'll regret leaving me someday, sir!

621
00:57:45,870 --> 00:57:47,750
You're so lucky, bitch.

622
00:57:50,410 --> 00:57:54,740
If I ever bite someone, he'd be the first.

623
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:56,620
By the way, sir.

624
00:57:56,660 --> 00:58:00,160
I must have menopause.

625
00:58:00,450 --> 00:58:02,990
I keep getting hot flashes.

626
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:04,790
See? I'm burning inside!

627
00:58:05,950 --> 00:58:06,870
I'm hot! Get back!

628
00:58:06,910 --> 00:58:08,240
Don't do this!

629
00:58:08,290 --> 00:58:09,370
Get back, sir!

630
00:58:09,410 --> 00:58:11,330
What are you staring at?

631
00:58:11,370 --> 00:58:13,290
Get ready! We have to go!

632
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:17,160
Don't be a burden on us.

633
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:19,370
She won't budge.

634
00:58:19,410 --> 00:58:20,330
Why you!

635
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:22,700
Stop! You're asking to die!

636
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:24,410
What's with you, sir?

637
00:58:31,290 --> 00:58:32,420
What are you doing?

638
00:58:32,450 --> 00:58:33,620
Stop it, sir!

639
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:35,120
Are you a pervert?

640
00:58:42,410 --> 00:58:44,160
What's wrong?

641
00:58:45,790 --> 00:58:47,580
Get away! Stop!

642
00:59:11,370 --> 00:59:15,750
Did it really say 'A-gyo' on the arrowhead?

643
00:59:16,330 --> 00:59:20,120
Why? You think I can't even read?

644
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,490
Just let me see.

645
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:26,420
No way! I'm mad you think I can't read!

646
00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:28,290
I'll bite you!

647
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:35,240
It's a simplified character.

648
00:59:35,830 --> 00:59:38,920
Simplified characters were made to...

649
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:40,120
Wol-gyo.

650
00:59:41,290 --> 00:59:43,040
You read it wrong.

651
00:59:43,370 --> 00:59:44,750
I knew it was Wol-gyo.

652
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:46,620
Of course, I knew.

653
00:59:48,370 --> 00:59:50,540
I was right again.

654
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:53,960
This pond is called Wol-gyo.

655
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,620
Ganghwa Hall used to be here.

656
00:59:57,870 --> 00:59:59,250
Ganghwa Hall?

657
00:59:59,290 --> 01:00:03,120
Some say it's the revenge of those
who died in the Ganghwa Hall fire.

658
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:07,870
Then the next victim must
be connected to this place.

659
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:12,990
If the fire here was plotted
to kill innocent lives,

660
01:00:13,790 --> 01:00:18,080
he's killing those
involved to get revenge?

661
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:20,830
That ghastly fool!

662
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:27,830
He must have his reasons.

663
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:34,740
The monster must've once been a human too.

664
01:00:36,830 --> 01:00:37,830
Like me.

665
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:44,250
There's sadness in his eyes.

666
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:54,790
Didn't you lose your memory?

667
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:57,990
How do you know about Ganghwa Hall?

668
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:00,990
I'm not sure.

669
01:01:02,330 --> 01:01:03,960
It just came to me.

670
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:08,450
I saw Ganghwa Hall here.

671
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:37,330
The arrowhead pointed to Ganghwa Hall?

672
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:41,120
The next victim is connected
to the fire 30 years ago.

673
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:44,830
Ask realtors and find out
why Ganghwa Hall is gone.

674
01:01:45,450 --> 01:01:47,700
I'll investigate more on Ha Byung-eun.

675
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:58,670
He must be Ha Byung-eun's father.

676
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:16,420
Why hold a sacrifice instead of
wishing his son's spirit well?

677
01:02:53,830 --> 01:02:54,830
Nan?

678
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:02,960
Have you forgotten?

679
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:08,000
Did you think it was over?

680
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:14,200
You watched me die, but lived comfortably?

681
01:03:17,490 --> 01:03:21,030
Just as you murdered my wife and son,

682
01:03:21,830 --> 01:03:24,460
I'll destroy you and your family!

683
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:28,040
Forgive me!

684
01:03:30,950 --> 01:03:33,790
I deserve to die!

685
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:14,120
I couldn't protect you to the end.

686
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:16,120
I'm sorry.

687
01:04:19,740 --> 01:04:20,740
Son!

688
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:30,530
- Ganghwa Hall?
- Yes.

689
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:35,040
I heard Ganghwa Hall
burned down 30 years ago.

690
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:36,620
What happened?

691
01:04:37,910 --> 01:04:39,540
It wasn't just a fire.

692
01:04:42,410 --> 01:04:43,410
It was treason.

693
01:04:44,290 --> 01:04:45,080
Treason?

694
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:50,660
They say that the Crown
Prince was poisoned there.

695
01:04:51,290 --> 01:04:56,830
So, the Jeong family was annihilated
and a pond was made there.

696
01:04:57,040 --> 01:05:01,460
The Jeong family owned Ganghwa Hall?

697
01:05:06,790 --> 01:05:08,580
He killed your son!

698
01:05:08,620 --> 01:05:09,790
Who is he?

699
01:05:10,490 --> 01:05:11,410
Jeong In-yul!

700
01:05:11,450 --> 01:05:14,540
The Jeong family has been loyal
to the king for generations.

701
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:18,330
Jeong In-yul and his father
were very loyal too.

702
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:24,080
But they were executed
for plotting treason.

703
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:25,670
Jeong In-yul...

704
01:05:26,490 --> 01:05:30,370
He's back from hell!

705
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:32,370
Jeong In-yul...

706
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:46,540
A royal award?

707
01:05:46,910 --> 01:05:50,370
For those who reported the
Crown Prince's murder?

708
01:05:51,290 --> 01:05:53,540
Hong Jeong-ho, Song Gap-young, Ha Il-ju...

709
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:55,080
Hong...

710
01:05:55,490 --> 01:05:57,280
Hong Tae-mun, Song Pil-geun, Ha Byung-eun!

711
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:00,620
He killed the sons of those here in order!

712
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:02,830
There must be two more names.

713
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:04,240
Choi Il-kyu?

714
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:07,370
- The owner of Yeon-mi Lodge?
- Yes.

715
01:06:07,950 --> 01:06:11,290
The land and building
belonged to the Jeong family.

716
01:06:11,330 --> 01:06:14,670
But after they died, everything
went to Choi Il-kyu.

717
01:06:15,410 --> 01:06:18,870
Then the next target must
be his son, Jae-kyung.

718
01:06:19,290 --> 01:06:23,710
He knew his turn would come,
so he read up on monsters.

719
01:06:24,290 --> 01:06:25,290
Jeong In-yul...

720
01:06:25,790 --> 01:06:29,420
He's getting revenge on those
who reported the treason.

721
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:35,160
Today's the 12th!

722
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:36,620
What about it, sir?

723
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:38,200
Hong Tae-mun died on the 3rd.

724
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:39,490
Song died on the 6th.

725
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:41,170
And Ha died on the 9th!

726
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:44,120
There's no time!

727
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:48,080
We can't fight a vampire
with our bare hands!

728
01:06:50,410 --> 01:06:52,450
Then how do we stop it, sir?

729
01:06:52,830 --> 01:06:55,290
Strike it with silver or burn it!

730
01:06:55,740 --> 01:06:59,660
If you don't burn its heart,
it could be revived with blood.

731
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:41,120
The killer will come here tonight.

732
01:07:41,910 --> 01:07:45,620
He has extraordinary skills
and won't be easy to fight.

733
01:07:45,950 --> 01:07:47,410
You must shoot...

734
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:57,330
You must shoot him with fiery arrows!

735
01:07:57,660 --> 01:07:58,660
Yes, sir!

736
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:23,240
Jeong In-yul!

737
01:09:26,410 --> 01:09:30,160
You and your father
poisoned the Crown Prince!

738
01:09:30,370 --> 01:09:33,000
But you want revenge?

739
01:09:33,370 --> 01:09:35,160
Rather than repent,

740
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:37,160
you took innocent lives!

741
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:39,790
You will pay for your crime!

742
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:42,580
Pay for my crime?

743
01:09:43,660 --> 01:09:46,450
You'll die here too!

744
01:10:10,870 --> 01:10:12,200
Pain, you say?

745
01:10:13,290 --> 01:10:15,580
What do you know about never-ending pain!

746
01:10:16,410 --> 01:10:20,040
How dare you tell me to pay for my crime!

747
01:10:25,370 --> 01:10:26,540
Put him down.

748
01:10:30,620 --> 01:10:32,950
Though you seek blood now,

749
01:10:33,330 --> 01:10:35,830
were you not once a man of honor?

750
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:42,000
Since your memory isn't back,

751
01:10:42,990 --> 01:10:45,530
you must not know how you died.

752
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:49,950
Why?

753
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:53,080
Think your death was different from mine?

754
01:10:53,700 --> 01:10:56,870
When you remember how you
died and who killed you,

755
01:10:57,410 --> 01:11:00,870
you'll become just like me.

756
01:11:00,910 --> 01:11:01,910
No.

757
01:11:02,330 --> 01:11:04,250
I won't be a monster like you.

758
01:11:04,870 --> 01:11:06,160
Drink blood.

759
01:11:07,370 --> 01:11:10,040
Find your painful memories

760
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:13,870
and get revenge on the
day of the full moon!

761
01:11:58,790 --> 01:12:00,290
You must live!

762
01:12:23,270 --> 01:12:26,520
You want to turn me into a real vampire?

763
01:12:29,390 --> 01:12:31,680
Why did you try to give me blood?

764
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:35,890
I wanted to save you.

765
01:12:38,770 --> 01:12:39,770
Why?

766
01:12:44,350 --> 01:12:46,600
What if I bite you?

767
01:12:47,350 --> 01:12:48,890
You'll become a vampire too.

768
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:52,310
Do you wish to live on innocent blood?

769
01:12:53,810 --> 01:12:58,100
Even so, I would never drink
someone else's blood.

770
01:13:03,770 --> 01:13:07,480
Then I'll bite Seo-pil for you,
so you won't be lonely.

771
01:13:19,810 --> 01:13:22,810
Being with the crazy girl,
you've lost your mind, sir.

772
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:02,560
Yes, ma'am.

773
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:15,690
<i>SIR HA IL-JU AND CHOI IL-KYU DIED</i>

774
01:14:17,270 --> 01:14:21,980
<i>No warnings this time?
There must be another target.</i>

775
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:27,270
Seo-pil? Wake up.

776
01:14:27,310 --> 01:14:29,230
Let me hold your hand.

777
01:14:29,690 --> 01:14:31,570
I said wake up!

778
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:02,140
<i>I'll bite Seo-pil for you.</i>

779
01:15:15,890 --> 01:15:18,060
Get dressed, already!

780
01:15:18,100 --> 01:15:19,440
Yes, sir.

781
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:22,390
Someone will die in 3 days.

782
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:24,770
We must find the last informer before then.

783
01:15:38,230 --> 01:15:41,270
Choi Il-kyu must have the royal award too.

784
01:15:42,060 --> 01:15:45,480
Why hide a proud certificate?

785
01:15:46,940 --> 01:15:49,070
Was he ashamed of it?

786
01:15:58,770 --> 01:16:00,520
The full moon is in 3 days.

787
01:16:00,980 --> 01:16:03,230
It's when the spirits'
powers are the strongest!

788
01:16:03,270 --> 01:16:04,270
Wait!

789
01:16:04,890 --> 01:16:06,810
The Full Moon Fest...

790
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:09,270
His Majesty will be here!

791
01:16:09,310 --> 01:16:10,310
Sir?

792
01:16:10,770 --> 01:16:12,150
Please run away.

793
01:16:13,230 --> 01:16:15,190
I can't protect you any longer!

794
01:16:30,020 --> 01:16:31,850
What do you fools want?

795
01:16:31,890 --> 01:16:32,890
Sir!

796
01:16:33,730 --> 01:16:36,650
Stay back. I'll handle them.

797
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:38,600
But...

798
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:42,690
I'm immortal now, sir.

799
01:16:43,350 --> 01:16:44,770
My body is on fire.

800
01:16:45,140 --> 01:16:47,270
I can't control my new powers!

801
01:16:47,730 --> 01:16:50,110
- Seo-pil! Actually...
- Listen!

802
01:16:50,140 --> 01:16:53,640
I'll have mercy and give you time to run.

803
01:16:53,690 --> 01:16:57,690
Or else today will be
your last day as humans!

804
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:03,230
Foolish thugs!

805
01:17:04,270 --> 01:17:08,600
I'll feast off your blood!

806
01:17:09,060 --> 01:17:11,350
I drew the bite marks on you!

807
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:25,970
You have what I want.

808
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:29,600
If you give it to me, I'll go quietly.

809
01:17:34,810 --> 01:17:36,810
This will help you decide.

810
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:42,100
Stop!

811
01:18:06,730 --> 01:18:11,520
When I awoke in the mountain,
a monk gave it to me.

812
01:18:13,190 --> 01:18:15,110
The case 30 years ago...

813
01:18:15,850 --> 01:18:18,980
Maybe the perpetrators and
victims should be switched.

814
01:18:19,810 --> 01:18:22,770
Those thugs are trying to hide something!

815
01:18:23,190 --> 01:18:26,690
What did they want? What was inside?

816
01:18:29,060 --> 01:18:33,690
It was a scroll with strange secret codes.

817
01:18:33,730 --> 01:18:34,730
Secret codes?

818
01:18:36,350 --> 01:18:39,190
My clever brain would've solved it!

819
01:18:39,230 --> 01:18:40,520
What a pity.

820
01:18:41,390 --> 01:18:42,390
Dang!

821
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:44,480
- Why you little!
- What?

822
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:45,690
I remember!

823
01:18:56,350 --> 01:18:59,560
Secret codes are written
with certain patterns.

824
01:18:59,850 --> 01:19:02,480
If you find the pattern, it can be read.

825
01:19:15,060 --> 01:19:17,600
Where's that clever brain of yours?

826
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:18,810
Huh, sir?

827
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:48,600
I knew it!

828
01:19:49,390 --> 01:19:50,390
I was wrong.

829
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:53,690
Could you write up another one?

830
01:19:57,140 --> 01:19:59,100
Right here! Just bite him!

831
01:20:13,230 --> 01:20:14,480
Get back, sir.

832
01:20:16,890 --> 01:20:18,470
You're confusing me!

833
01:20:29,310 --> 01:20:30,310
Wait!

834
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:32,520
They used Korean alphabet!

835
01:20:36,310 --> 01:20:40,730
The 1st and 3rd lines are consonants
written with vertical symmetry.

836
01:20:40,770 --> 01:20:44,560
The middle line has vowels
drawn with triangles.

837
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:48,520
The circles mean 'A'.
The triangles mean 'O' or 'U'.

838
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:52,310
Circles with lines mean 'E' and so on.

839
01:20:58,230 --> 01:21:02,480
<i>POISON THE CROWN PRINCE AND FRAME
JEONG IN-YUL AND HIS FATHER</i>

840
01:21:03,190 --> 01:21:04,190
I knew it!

841
01:21:05,980 --> 01:21:09,190
Those who reported the treason
were the real traitors!

842
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:10,640
What do you mean?

843
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:13,480
It's a conspiracy pact.

844
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:16,230
The Crown Prince's death was fabricated!

845
01:21:16,730 --> 01:21:18,520
Those who poisoned him

846
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:22,600
framed it on Jeong In-yul
and his father as treason!

847
01:21:25,140 --> 01:21:28,310
So, Jeong In-yul is
getting revenge on them?

848
01:21:28,770 --> 01:21:31,020
What do you know about never-ending pain!

849
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:33,650
I don't know how he became a vampire.

850
01:21:33,980 --> 01:21:35,940
But by killing the traitors' sons,

851
01:21:36,270 --> 01:21:39,230
he wanted them to suffer
more pain than death.

852
01:21:40,060 --> 01:21:42,480
He'll kill the last traitor's son next!

853
01:21:44,310 --> 01:21:45,730
Song Gap-young.

854
01:21:46,060 --> 01:21:47,730
Ha Il-ju.

855
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:49,520
Choi Il-kyu.

856
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:50,940
And

857
01:21:50,980 --> 01:21:52,230
Kim...

858
01:21:54,810 --> 01:21:56,390
And who, sir?

859
01:21:58,560 --> 01:21:59,730
Kim Shin?

860
01:22:01,020 --> 01:22:02,020
Kim Shin?

861
01:22:02,890 --> 01:22:04,810
Your father, sir?

862
01:22:06,940 --> 01:22:08,940
Jeong In-yul knew me.

863
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:12,940
How dare you tell me to pay for my crime!

864
01:22:13,390 --> 01:22:15,770
He knows I'm the last informer's son.

865
01:22:18,690 --> 01:22:19,860
Kim Shin?

866
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:38,820
What brings you here, Min?

867
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:23,640
Give me blood.

868
01:23:25,730 --> 01:23:26,730
I want...

869
01:23:29,140 --> 01:23:30,140
blood.

870
01:23:54,060 --> 01:23:56,190
The subjects are watching.

871
01:23:56,770 --> 01:23:57,770
Let them.

872
01:23:59,190 --> 01:24:02,480
I should hold my beloved's
hand on a night like this.

873
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:05,270
Mother!

874
01:24:05,310 --> 01:24:06,890
Father!

875
01:24:08,190 --> 01:24:09,230
Prince!

876
01:24:09,730 --> 01:24:12,070
Our son must've had a bad dream.

877
01:24:18,940 --> 01:24:22,690
What happened 30 years ago?

878
01:24:25,980 --> 01:24:29,900
Jeong In-yul is the one who called me here.

879
01:24:30,140 --> 01:24:32,470
Jeong In-yul died!

880
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:35,770
I saw it with my own eyes!

881
01:24:36,230 --> 01:24:40,150
If you don't tell me,
I'll hear it from him.

882
01:24:40,690 --> 01:24:42,020
I did it for you!

883
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:46,060
Did you make a wish?

884
01:24:48,940 --> 01:24:49,940
Yes, sir.

885
01:24:50,230 --> 01:24:52,730
I wished for His Majesty's

886
01:24:52,770 --> 01:24:55,190
<i>JEONG IN-YUL</i>
quick recovery, Your Highness.

887
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:02,760
You make me an unfilial son.

888
01:25:02,790 --> 01:25:05,210
How is that so, Your Highness?

889
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:10,380
The world knows you tend to
His Majesty every night.

890
01:25:10,420 --> 01:25:13,210
I just did what a subject should.

891
01:25:14,670 --> 01:25:15,670
I was kidding.

892
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:20,210
Your Highness?

893
01:25:20,790 --> 01:25:22,420
What did you wish for?

894
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:26,260
I wished for Joseon

895
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:29,880
to be returned to its owner.

896
01:25:31,290 --> 01:25:33,960
Joseon belongs to His Majesty and you, sir.

897
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:38,210
A king should not be the
owner of a country.

898
01:25:39,290 --> 01:25:42,370
The people should be.

899
01:25:44,250 --> 01:25:46,590
Joseon doesn't belong to the people now.

900
01:25:48,210 --> 01:25:51,210
Those who must work for
the people rule them.

901
01:25:51,630 --> 01:25:54,380
They make factions and fight
to keep what's theirs.

902
01:25:54,670 --> 01:25:57,550
They try to control the
king and alienate others.

903
01:25:58,250 --> 01:26:00,630
They frame their opposers as traitors.

904
01:26:03,090 --> 01:26:04,970
They're the ones who own Joseon.

905
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:09,880
When I become king,

906
01:26:11,290 --> 01:26:15,040
I'll take Joseon away from them
and give it back to the people.

907
01:26:17,290 --> 01:26:19,170
I trust you will, sir.

908
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:23,750
See the lanterns?

909
01:26:24,290 --> 01:26:27,750
Do you know what the people wished for?

910
01:26:29,540 --> 01:26:31,870
The people make small cries.

911
01:26:32,340 --> 01:26:34,920
It's their leaders who raise their voices.

912
01:26:40,340 --> 01:26:44,220
Joseon doesn't need people
to talk for the civilians.

913
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:48,420
We need people to listen
to their small cries.

914
01:26:49,250 --> 01:26:56,880
I want to make it so that civilians
will not suffer from hunger and pain.

915
01:27:00,790 --> 01:27:03,790
Did you find anything?

916
01:27:07,380 --> 01:27:10,590
It's been long since I
sent you to Ganghwa Hall.

917
01:27:11,340 --> 01:27:13,260
Promise me first, sir.

918
01:27:13,290 --> 01:27:14,870
You found a way?

919
01:27:15,630 --> 01:27:16,630
Tell me.

920
01:27:18,420 --> 01:27:19,840
Why are you hesitating?

921
01:27:20,380 --> 01:27:25,090
Do you wish to see your
entire family be annihilated?

922
01:27:35,170 --> 01:27:36,050
What is it?

923
01:27:36,090 --> 01:27:38,010
The Crown Prince has passed away!

924
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:39,040
What?

925
01:27:40,460 --> 01:27:41,460
But how?

926
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:44,500
Sir! Sir!

927
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:47,290
Please run away! Your
father's been arrested!

928
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:48,340
My father? Why?

929
01:27:48,380 --> 01:27:50,840
That he poisoned His Highness...

930
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:52,170
That's preposterous!

931
01:27:57,630 --> 01:27:59,720
Your Highness! You must leave at once.

932
01:28:00,170 --> 01:28:01,460
What do you mean?

933
01:28:02,210 --> 01:28:03,290
Where is His Highness?

934
01:28:06,630 --> 01:28:09,130
The young prince is in danger.
Please change.

935
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:16,500
Let's go.

936
01:28:18,790 --> 01:28:19,790
Where are you going?

937
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:23,260
You know very well that my
father would never do this.

938
01:28:23,290 --> 01:28:24,370
He's been framed!

939
01:28:24,420 --> 01:28:28,300
Those who killed His Highness
will be after the prince.

940
01:28:41,420 --> 01:28:42,420
Your Highness!

941
01:28:42,460 --> 01:28:43,880
Please follow me.

942
01:30:02,290 --> 01:30:03,290
Your Highness?

943
01:30:03,340 --> 01:30:04,380
Please sit here.

944
01:30:08,920 --> 01:30:10,960
They won't come here.

945
01:30:13,750 --> 01:30:14,750
Thank you.

946
01:30:16,670 --> 01:30:18,920
How could you come in here?

947
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:20,710
Haven't you heard about this ship?

948
01:30:20,750 --> 01:30:22,040
It's a revolt.

949
01:30:22,290 --> 01:30:25,750
We must protect the prince
until things settle down.

950
01:30:32,250 --> 01:30:33,130
In-yul!

951
01:30:33,210 --> 01:30:34,210
Run away!

952
01:30:35,460 --> 01:30:38,750
Protect them no matter what!

953
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:43,840
Hurry!

954
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:51,260
But it's treason, sir! I can't do it.

955
01:30:51,290 --> 01:30:52,290
You fool!

956
01:30:53,630 --> 01:30:55,090
It's not treason.

957
01:30:56,040 --> 01:30:59,540
The Crown Prince becoming king is treason!

958
01:31:01,130 --> 01:31:05,720
He's filled with absurd ideals!
If he becomes king, Joseon will fall!

959
01:31:06,670 --> 01:31:09,920
<i>A country does not thrive on ideals alone!</i>

960
01:31:10,710 --> 01:31:17,250
<i>The only way to save your family
is to bring down the Crown Prince!</i>

961
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:30,130
What are you doing?

962
01:31:35,630 --> 01:31:36,630
Please...

963
01:31:37,460 --> 01:31:39,250
Please let the prince live?

964
01:31:52,590 --> 01:31:53,720
Open the door.

965
01:31:54,040 --> 01:31:55,620
Open it now!

966
01:31:56,540 --> 01:31:59,870
Just let the prince live!

967
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:02,710
Please save the prince!

968
01:32:03,420 --> 01:32:04,420
No!

969
01:32:09,210 --> 01:32:13,040
It would've been better to
die than to beg for life.

970
01:32:14,170 --> 01:32:15,170
You fool!

971
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:20,130
If I didn't do that, our family
would've been annihilated!

972
01:32:20,670 --> 01:32:24,170
I abandoned my friend and the Crown Prince

973
01:32:24,670 --> 01:32:26,210
to save you!

974
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:32,840
You mean, this is all because of me?

975
01:32:33,630 --> 01:32:35,880
You did all that for me?

976
01:32:36,210 --> 01:32:39,090
Then what makes me different
from the monster?

977
01:32:39,710 --> 01:32:43,840
I lived well in a family that
thrived on innocent blood!

978
01:32:43,880 --> 01:32:45,920
Then I'm a monster too!

979
01:33:03,710 --> 01:33:04,840
Scour the area!

980
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:06,960
Yes, sir!

981
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:18,040
Prince...

982
01:33:19,710 --> 01:33:21,040
You must survive.

983
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:23,970
Search there!

984
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:48,920
Find them!

985
01:34:01,590 --> 01:34:02,880
Don't let them get away!

986
01:34:11,340 --> 01:34:13,010
Corner her and catch her!

987
01:34:34,300 --> 01:34:35,550
Mother?

988
01:34:35,590 --> 01:34:40,920
If snow falls before the balsam fades,

989
01:34:40,970 --> 01:34:45,350
I heard you can meet the one you miss.

990
01:34:45,930 --> 01:34:47,060
Prince?

991
01:34:47,510 --> 01:34:50,090
Where did you hear that?

992
01:34:50,140 --> 01:34:56,850
It doesn't matter for
me if the balsam fades.

993
01:34:57,300 --> 01:34:58,300
Why?

994
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:01,590
Even if you can't meet the one you miss?

995
01:35:01,720 --> 01:35:06,470
I'll live with you and Father forever.

996
01:35:06,510 --> 01:35:09,590
I won't miss anyone.

997
01:35:32,390 --> 01:35:34,220
You were Sun...

998
01:35:39,180 --> 01:35:41,310
My son, Sun...

999
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:49,590
I didn't even hold your hand.

1000
01:35:52,640 --> 01:35:54,270
You died...

1001
01:35:57,930 --> 01:36:00,930
before even calling me mother.

1002
01:36:05,720 --> 01:36:07,180
I'm sorry.

1003
01:36:10,760 --> 01:36:12,430
I'm so sorry.

1004
01:36:27,010 --> 01:36:28,010
Your Highness!

1005
01:36:28,510 --> 01:36:29,550
I, Jeong In-yul,

1006
01:36:30,010 --> 01:36:33,260
was disloyal in being
deceived by a greedy friend.

1007
01:36:34,090 --> 01:36:37,630
I will punish him for harming
the Crown Prince and prince.

1008
01:36:40,840 --> 01:36:45,920
I'll burn everything he
owns once and for all!

1009
01:36:47,050 --> 01:36:50,140
He will come tomorrow
during the Full Moon Fest.

1010
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:52,470
That puts His Majesty in harms way!

1011
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:54,550
We must reveal everything.

1012
01:36:55,300 --> 01:36:56,720
Even if I must die,

1013
01:36:57,260 --> 01:36:59,970
I'll reveal your crimes, Father!

1014
01:37:05,930 --> 01:37:08,310
Lock him away at once!

1015
01:37:57,550 --> 01:37:58,550
Sir!

1016
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:00,880
Stay back!

1017
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:06,640
<i>I'm their owner's son.
They'll never harm me.</i>

1018
01:38:09,180 --> 01:38:11,020
Stay back or else!

1019
01:38:11,260 --> 01:38:12,300
This sir...

1020
01:38:12,340 --> 01:38:14,550
This fool is dead!

1021
01:38:15,050 --> 01:38:16,760
I said stay back!

1022
01:38:20,090 --> 01:38:21,220
My toe!

1023
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:23,510
- Are you all right?
- I have gout!

1024
01:38:57,890 --> 01:38:58,890
Giddy up!

1025
01:38:59,140 --> 01:39:00,140
Giddy up!

1026
01:39:01,470 --> 01:39:02,470
Giddy up!

1027
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:32,840
Giddy up!

1028
01:39:34,970 --> 01:39:36,260
What are you doing?

1029
01:39:36,300 --> 01:39:38,260
I'll protect you! Grab the reins!

1030
01:39:38,840 --> 01:39:40,260
Seo-pil!

1031
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:54,890
My gout!

1032
01:41:53,260 --> 01:41:54,340
Were you scared?

1033
01:41:56,760 --> 01:42:01,010
Scared people will disdain
you if they own Joseon?

1034
01:42:04,300 --> 01:42:06,510
Scared you'll lose everything?

1035
01:42:10,180 --> 01:42:15,600
Scared my young son will
live and reveal your sins?

1036
01:42:45,390 --> 01:42:46,850
I've been waiting.

1037
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:51,180
I could strike you in the heart.

1038
01:42:53,220 --> 01:42:56,010
Please don't hesitate, Wol-young.

1039
01:42:58,090 --> 01:43:02,760
You must be so angry to
have to come back like this.

1040
01:43:04,140 --> 01:43:05,390
I must die

1041
01:43:06,010 --> 01:43:09,510
so your anger can be
resolved in the least bit.

1042
01:43:10,930 --> 01:43:16,430
I hope this will pay for
some of my father's sins.

1043
01:43:17,180 --> 01:43:19,770
Your father did not
only take away my life,

1044
01:43:21,390 --> 01:43:23,270
but my son and husband too.

1045
01:43:24,390 --> 01:43:29,220
We just wanted to be together.

1046
01:43:31,430 --> 01:43:33,140
That's all we wanted.

1047
01:43:34,680 --> 01:43:35,680
But

1048
01:43:36,470 --> 01:43:40,260
you enjoyed the last 30 years
upon their unjust deaths.

1049
01:43:41,260 --> 01:43:42,890
You ask me to kill you?

1050
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:46,800
Fine.

1051
01:43:48,760 --> 01:43:50,640
I'll kill you again and again!

1052
01:44:05,720 --> 01:44:07,800
<i>I want to know who I am.</i>

1053
01:44:08,470 --> 01:44:12,930
<i>Perhaps you lived in the distant past.</i>

1054
01:44:13,260 --> 01:44:14,720
Maybe 100 years ago?

1055
01:44:15,300 --> 01:44:16,390
That long?

1056
01:44:17,470 --> 01:44:18,800
Then I'd be so old.

1057
01:44:19,010 --> 01:44:20,890
Shall I call you granny?

1058
01:44:20,930 --> 01:44:23,640
No! I'd rather be called a monster.

1059
01:45:50,140 --> 01:45:51,890
It was exactly 30 years ago.

1060
01:45:52,550 --> 01:45:55,090
Trying to save you, I became a monster.

1061
01:45:55,930 --> 01:45:56,930
But you!

1062
01:45:57,760 --> 01:46:01,260
To fill your filthy mouth,
you killed the Crown Prince!

1063
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:03,630
And my father and I!

1064
01:46:07,680 --> 01:46:08,680
Jeong In-yul!

1065
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:18,880
I know the truth to your unjust suffering!

1066
01:46:19,340 --> 01:46:22,840
I'll reveal everything, so stop this!

1067
01:46:24,010 --> 01:46:25,050
The truth?

1068
01:46:26,090 --> 01:46:27,010
That's right!

1069
01:46:27,050 --> 01:46:28,050
Tonight!

1070
01:46:29,680 --> 01:46:34,270
The truth will burn you alive!

1071
01:46:56,720 --> 01:46:57,720
No!

1072
01:47:08,840 --> 01:47:10,970
Die you evil monster!

1073
01:47:16,430 --> 01:47:18,350
You call me a monster?

1074
01:47:20,720 --> 01:47:23,220
After knowing what your father did to me?

1075
01:47:23,510 --> 01:47:26,720
How dare you call me a monster?

1076
01:47:27,140 --> 01:47:28,470
30 years ago,

1077
01:47:30,010 --> 01:47:33,010
you became a monster to save a friend.

1078
01:47:34,140 --> 01:47:35,180
But now!

1079
01:47:35,890 --> 01:47:39,810
You kill innocent people for revenge!

1080
01:47:40,180 --> 01:47:42,310
And threaten His Majesty's life!

1081
01:47:43,300 --> 01:47:45,590
You're just a monster!

1082
01:48:00,090 --> 01:48:01,220
Now, die!

1083
01:48:12,390 --> 01:48:13,470
Your Highness!

1084
01:48:14,640 --> 01:48:16,220
You've done enough.

1085
01:48:16,470 --> 01:48:17,600
No, Your Highness!

1086
01:48:18,180 --> 01:48:20,850
He must die to finish my revenge.

1087
01:48:25,390 --> 01:48:28,350
Those who made us into
monsters are all dead.

1088
01:48:30,010 --> 01:48:31,140
Stop.

1089
01:48:33,930 --> 01:48:35,270
It's over now.

1090
01:48:39,800 --> 01:48:44,390
I don't know how to stop.

1091
01:48:46,260 --> 01:48:48,260
My father is still alive in my heart.

1092
01:48:49,430 --> 01:48:54,850
His Highness and the prince
must be alive in you too!

1093
01:48:55,090 --> 01:48:58,800
I can't stop here.

1094
01:49:24,590 --> 01:49:26,720
You know very well

1095
01:49:27,760 --> 01:49:31,260
that we should not have come back to life.

1096
01:49:33,550 --> 01:49:36,640
We're just monsters who crave human blood.

1097
01:49:39,510 --> 01:49:42,890
Though we've gotten our revenge,

1098
01:49:45,430 --> 01:49:48,640
we can only live on the
blood of innocent people.

1099
01:49:51,720 --> 01:49:53,430
We've done enough.

1100
01:49:54,930 --> 01:49:56,600
It's time to go.

1101
01:50:08,050 --> 01:50:09,510
I, Jeong In-yul,

1102
01:50:10,720 --> 01:50:12,800
shall go to the Crown Prince first.

1103
01:50:16,010 --> 01:50:18,220
Forgive me, Your Highness.

1104
01:51:03,590 --> 01:51:04,470
Your Highness!

1105
01:51:04,510 --> 01:51:05,680
Please go inside!

1106
01:51:29,550 --> 01:51:31,550
What is time?

1107
01:51:31,590 --> 01:51:34,090
Please hide from the sunlight!

1108
01:51:37,180 --> 01:51:42,270
Waiting is only possible in time.

1109
01:51:52,680 --> 01:51:55,430
But the balsam stain remains...

1110
01:51:59,140 --> 01:52:01,970
Will I meet the ones I miss?

1111
01:53:07,890 --> 01:53:09,770
I missed you so much.

1112
01:53:43,050 --> 01:53:44,340
30 years ago,

1113
01:53:44,680 --> 01:53:49,560
Kim Shin poisoned the Crown Prince
and framed the Jeong family.

1114
01:53:50,050 --> 01:53:53,140
Thus, seize all his assets and servants.

1115
01:53:53,470 --> 01:53:57,600
Although his son revealed everything,

1116
01:53:57,890 --> 01:54:04,220
Kim Min must also be
beheaded to uphold the law!

1117
01:54:14,140 --> 01:54:16,520
<i>A MONTH LATER</i>

1118
01:54:28,010 --> 01:54:30,840
I heard you've gone a little cuckoo.

1119
01:54:31,180 --> 01:54:32,470
Maybe a lot.

1120
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:40,760
He's coming! He's coming for me!

1121
01:54:40,800 --> 01:54:43,640
Who? Who's coming for you?

1122
01:54:44,680 --> 01:54:46,220
He came in my dreams.

1123
01:54:47,090 --> 01:54:49,470
He said he's coming for me!

1124
01:54:50,470 --> 01:54:53,260
So weak for a young fellow.

1125
01:55:02,220 --> 01:55:03,970
If you're a man, state your name!

1126
01:55:04,010 --> 01:55:05,970
If you're a ghost, go away!

1127
01:55:14,390 --> 01:55:15,390
It's me!

1128
01:55:26,140 --> 01:55:28,020
I waited so long.

1129
01:55:37,470 --> 01:55:38,470
Your Majesty!

1130
01:55:41,300 --> 01:55:42,760
You're already dead.

1131
01:55:44,840 --> 01:55:48,010
Kim Min no longer exists in Joseon.

1132
01:55:50,300 --> 01:55:56,510
There are many things you
must do for me in secret.

1133
01:55:59,090 --> 01:56:02,050
What did His Majesty command?

1134
01:56:02,470 --> 01:56:04,180
A month ago, in Andong,

1135
01:56:04,470 --> 01:56:08,390
the dead started to come
back to life and eat people.

1136
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:09,890
Man-eating dead?

1137
01:56:09,930 --> 01:56:10,930
Yes!

1138
01:56:11,050 --> 01:56:13,390
They exist but do not.

1139
01:56:13,590 --> 01:56:17,550
They are called zombies.

1140
01:56:17,930 --> 01:56:18,930
Oh really?

1141
01:56:19,760 --> 01:56:20,760
Good luck!

1142
01:56:20,890 --> 01:56:23,140
Wait! Come with me!

1143
01:56:32,300 --> 01:56:37,050
