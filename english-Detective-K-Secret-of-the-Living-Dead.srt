Though you did it to save your son,

00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:38,230
your sins are no different
from those of vampires.

103
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:41,360

Vampires exist.

109
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,980
It's because you're not busy.

110
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,060

113
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:44,310
Such a pity that you think
the world is so puny.

114
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,610
In 1742, a report was made

115
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,940
about Scholar Choi and his servant.

116
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:55,480
The servant saw a mysterious light.

117
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:59,440
Then Choi vanished without a trace.

118
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,890

119
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,770

unbelievable incidents.

120
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:18,770
Who's to say vampires don't exist?

121
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,400
Do you have proof?

122
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,100
30 years ago,

123
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,560
a Westerners' ship headed for
China ran aground in Joseon.

124
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,600
There are records of
vampire sightings then.

125
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,720
Come on, sir.

126
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,560
Cut the nonsense and do
your detective work.

127
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,640
Aren't you paying me rent?

128
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:40,650
Stop roaming and go back
to your nice house.

129
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,520
Then I'll have to get married!

130
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,480
If you must, why not?

131
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:55,900
I don't wish to marry without love.

132
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:58,310
Then tell your father that.

133
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:01,900
- He decided who I'll marry.
- So what?

134
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:06,110
You're good at speaking your mind.
Can't you talk to your father?

135
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,640
It's your life, sir!

136
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,770
Just say no!

137
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:14,390
Say you're not marrying a
stranger without love.

138
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,480
I did!

139
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,560
I told him it's my life and
he can't decide for me.

140
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,100
And?

141
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,270
I got slapped.

142
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:26,360
He's firm.

143
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,270
I thought the Premier would be different.

144
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:30,480

Anticipation for the Full Moon Fest

146
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:37,310
is high throughout Joseon.

147
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:42,100
People of all ages are working hard

148
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:50,890
to prepare a greater fest than
the one 30 years ago, sir.

149
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:00,820
Recently, 10,000 people worked
on fortifying our forts.

150
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:07,150
It must be hard for them to work
for the Full Moon Fest too.

151
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:13,230
Thus, I shall grant a small reward
to the workers.

152
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:17,480
Set rice as the only tributary.

153
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:22,430
And have aristocrats pay
for the military cloth as well.

154
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:31,690
I, Premier Kim Shin, request
to speak, Your Majesty.

155
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:37,980
His Majesty's mercy and heart
for the people is like heaven.

156
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,270
However,

157
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:43,560
if aristocrats pay the same as peasants,

158
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,390
what makes them different, sir?

159
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:49,970
It'll destroy class distinction

160
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:53,150
and shake the basis of Joseon, sir.

161
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:56,320
Please, Your Majesty!

162
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:00,320
Please retract your command, sir!

163
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,440
Even the king can't have his way with him.

164
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,730
Any functional problems in getting married?

165
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:11,980
Why you little!

166
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:13,900
Excuse me.

167
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:41,810
Who?

168
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,190
It's scorched rice tea.

169
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:54,360
Thank you.

170
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:56,930
It has a rich, deep flavor.

171
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,850
I did a great job making it.

172
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,980
Let me introduce myself.

173
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,850
I'm the daughter of the
owner of Yeon-mi Lodge.

174
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:12,140
How could we be of help?

175
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:15,520
Recently, while repairing
building in Ganghwa,

176
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:19,560
the roof suddenly caved
in and many workers died.

177
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:25,190
While burying the dead,
two corpses were discovered.

178
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:29,940
One was a skeleton and
the other was burned.

179
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,610
However, the burnt one
wasn't decayed at all.

180
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,770
But that's not all!

181
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:38,640
While they went to report it,

182
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,690
The corpse disappeared!

183
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,640
Only the burnt corpse vanished!

184
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,610
Then another incident happened soon after.

185
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:50,150
It was quite peculiar.

186
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:53,650
Some say a man burned
to death by an invisible fire.

187
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,230
He died but was not dead.

188
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,900
He lived but did not live!

189
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:02,310
Some say it's the revenge of those
who died in the Ganghwa Hall fire.

190
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,770
The Full Moon Fest is taking
place after 30 years.

191
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:11,060
My father has been ordered
by the court to prepare it.

192
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:16,060
However, he is ill and can't
see to such problems.

193
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,480
I've come to ask you to
solve the mysteries for us.

194
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,060
It won't be easy.

195
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,310
Serial killings can't be ruled out.

196
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:29,440
I heard you are the best
in all of Joseon, sir.

197
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,850
I'm not the best.

198
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:38,640
I'm the best of the best!

199
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,060
It's sad that I can only
explain myself that way.

200
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,190
He's a little arrogant.

201
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,390
I see.

202
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,480
Let's talk accommodations.

203
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,100
Will it have two rooms
or one with living room?

204
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,810
One with living room, sir.

205
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,980
Inside bathroom or outside?

206
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:54,940
Inside, sir.

207
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:55,900
And breakfast?

208
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,150
Provided, sir.

209
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,440

The guest door is that way.

218
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,150
The owner's daughter asked me to come.

219
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,360
I'm a detective.

220
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:52,220
It's about the mysterious deaths here.

221
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,640
Your sister asked us to
come and investigate.

222
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:58,150
I don't know why she did that.

223
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,390
I don't know of such things.

225
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,560
He's a very famous detective, sir.

226
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,730
He solved the fake silver case and
even had dinner with the king.

227
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,610
I don't think he knows.

228
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,810
What if I explain it like this?

229
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,650
He got drunk before His Majesty and said,

230
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:37,060
'This isn't your country, pal!'

231
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:40,230
After the rude fiasco,
he was sent into exile.

232
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,730
That's him.

233
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:45,770
He's Premier Kim Shin's...

Or is it horse dung?

240
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,940
What is this, a barn?

241
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:09,190
It's not what she promised.

almost peed on the way!

00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:28,850
Shouldn't they give us fried eggs at least?

This is why you don't make
deals with a middleman.

A man died by the same fire last night.

What is the Full Moon Fest that
the magistrate can't investigate?

262
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:22,020
In the past, royal officials
would all gather to celebrate.

Don't tamper with the crime scene!

Do you know what's the most painful death?

293
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,860
Burning to death.

294
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:52,940
But the way he died shows no
sign of squirming in pain.

295
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:58,110
It means that he couldn't
move before he was burned.

00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:03,570
- An invisible fire...
- And...

320
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,610
The Buddhist monk on the poster?

321
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,890
Did anyone come for his body?

322

You're the first to come for him.

323
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:03,730
So, all you know is that
he's a Buddhist monk?

324
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:06,190
Why do you ask that?

325
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:07,480
Very well then.

326
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,560
Wait! Show me your identity tag!

327
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,520
Who are you, sir?

328
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,560
Didn't Sir Choi Jae-kyung mention us?

329
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,060
You're the detective from the capital?

330
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:26,810
Yes.

There's no case I can't solve.

332
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:31,230
- I'm the best detective in...
- Excuse me, sir.

333
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:35,360
Where did she go?

334
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:40,230
I wish to see Song Pil-geun's corpse.

335
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:41,730
That's impossible, sir.

336
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:44,560
The magistrate gave orders
never to show it to anyone.

337
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,850
Of course not! If the magistrate said so.

338
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:54,110
On second thought, maybe
he didn't say never.

339
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,470
There is no such thing as never.

340
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:01,310
- You could sneak a peek at night.
- Good.

341
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,860
- I'll come back at night.
- Yes, sir.

342
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:09,230
What did you draw, sir?

343
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:14,650
Isn't she the woman from before?

344
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:16,890
That lady...

345
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,100
Did you notice?

346
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,520
Well,

347
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,310
she was a bit odd and very strong.

348
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,390
She's gorgeous.

349
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,440
Not again.

350
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:29,430
Why draw a pretty woman
at a time like this?

351
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,400
I need it to investigate.

352
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,610
Investigate what?

353
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,480
If you want to meet her, just say it.

354
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,020
She's there wherever we go!

355
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:41,770
That means she's connected
to this case somehow.

356
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:46,150
- Then...
- Maybe...

357
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:49,770
She could be chasing us.

358
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:52,890
Us? Why, sir?

359
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,810
Sir! It's me!

360
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:59,640
You must find out who she is
and why she's after this case.

361
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:01,150
Yes, sir.

362
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:05,900
This rough chap looks suspicious.

363
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:08,400
It's a woman.

364
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,060
And she's pretty.

365
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:16,560
Are you going blind in your old age?

366
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,190
Forget it.

367
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:21,820
I'll find her. You can go back home.

368
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:22,850
No, sir!

369
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:26,430
I'll find this fool! I mean this woman!

370
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,230
Look.

371
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:36,850
There is soot in his nose.

372
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,140
He was burned when he was alive.

373
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:14,140
It appears we're here for the same purpose.

374
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:21,350
Would you like to take a look?

375
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,680
Or shall we fight and bring in the guards?

376
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:42,600
An invisible fire...

377
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:48,980
It seems he was fatally
wounded before burning.

378
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,850
Then the scar must be somewhere.

379
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:04,020
<i>While burying the dead,
two corpses were discovered.</i>

380
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,690
<i>The burnt one wasn't decayed at all.</i>

381
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,180
<i>Only the burnt corpse vanished!</i>

382
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,600
<i>Is it a real vampire?</i>

383
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:46,020
<i>The arrow precisely struck the heart.</i>

384
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:50,440
<i>He didn't just want the
blood, but to kill him.</i>

385
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:53,190
<i>'Yeom' means to stain.</i>

386
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:56,730
<i>Why did the killer leave a sign?</i>

387
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,890
<i>Perhaps a forewarned murder?</i>

388
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:04,060
This letter has something
to do with staining or dyes.

389
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:08,190
Go to the painting plant and
meet the painters for clues.

390
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:11,020
I'll search the dye house here.

391
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:18,600
<i>HA BYUNG-EUN</i>

392
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,440
Why are you here?

393
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:54,650
How long will you follow me?

394
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:58,860
I saw someone on fire too.

395
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,480
Where?

396
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:04,980
I'm not sure.

397
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:10,110
I'm not sure where, who,
or why I remember that.

398
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,820
He must've been killed by something
that looks human but is not.

399
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,980
Something that looks human but is not?

400
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:24,940
Are they really strong and fast?

401
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:27,320
And heal fast if they're hurt?

402
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,440
You know about vampires?

403
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,850
Vampires?

404
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:35,900
Vampires are immortal.

405
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:41,020
They don't get hurt or die.

406
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:43,480
Immortal?

407
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:41,600
I have a question.

408
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,350
You're definitely in my memory.

409
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:47,560
Who am I?

410
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,980
In becoming a monster,
your memory was lost.

411
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,480
If you want your memory back,

412
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,640
drink blood.

413
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,100
Are you all right?

414
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,520
You fool!

415
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:12,390
How dare you disturb the
laws of this world!

416
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:15,730
I know that you're behind
the ominous deaths!

417
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:18,730
How dare you try to live
by killing innocent people!

418
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:20,320
Innocent people?

419
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,020
Who?

420
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,140
How dare you!

421
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,190
Think you can get away with
murder because you're immortal?

422
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,350
I know how to banish you!

423
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,060
Do you want to remember?

424
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:36,980
Then watch this!

425
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:28,600
Sir! What happened!

426
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:34,690
We must get the arrow out.
Hold him down now!

427
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,570
That's a good idea.

428
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:42,820
But aren't we in the same class?
Stop giving me orders!

429
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:43,850
Hurry up!

430
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:47,770
I will, but watch it.

431
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,140
Sir?

432
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:45,650
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

433
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:52,270
Isn't she odd, sir?

434
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:54,520
Did you sense it too?

435
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:55,770
You too, sir?

436
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:57,020
Yes.

437
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:01,520
I thought she was strange from the start.

438
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:04,770
She goes around alone.

439
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,360
She talks down to you and gives commands.

440
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,270
She's out of this world, sir.

441
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:13,270
It all adds up to one thing.

442
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:14,890
What?

443
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:16,600
She's crazy.

444
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:21,350
Crazy girls don't wear flowers
on their heads these days.

445
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:25,270
Try all you want, but you can't fool me!

446
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:33,900
<i>If you want to remember, drink blood.</i>

447
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,520
<i>She fought off a vampire. Is she one too?</i>

448
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,520
<i>No, she's can't be.</i>

449
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,310
<i>If she is, she can't be fine in the sun.</i>

450
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:54,560
<i>And she wouldn't have saved me.</i>

451
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,390
<i>If he catches the monster
before I find my memory...</i>

452
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,520
<i>But she's similar to him.</i>

453
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:03,060
<i>He's arrogant, but has a useful brain.</i>

454
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:05,020
<i>She's quite arrogant.</i>

455
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,640
<i>But her ability to fight
him is quite useful.</i>

456
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:12,150
<i>With my brain and this woman's
body, we can catch the monster.</i>

457
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:13,270
<i>Work with her?</i>

458
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:14,650
<i>My brain and...</i>

459
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:16,440
<i>Seo-pil's body!</i>

460
00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:18,690
Damn it!

461
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:19,980
This woman's body!

462
00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:25,020
Oops. Did I say that out loud?

463
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:28,770
It's not what it sounded like.

464
00:44:28,810 --> 00:44:31,100
- I mean your...
- If you help me,

465
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:33,230
I'll help you catch the monster.

466
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:34,220
But

467
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:36,100
you can't ask anything about me.

468
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:39,570
Agreed. But help you with what?

469
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,020
I lost my memory.

470
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:47,520
I want to know who I am.

471
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:49,270
Fine.

472
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,520
But there's one problem.

473
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:53,890
What is it?

474
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:55,110
You don't call me sir.

475
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:56,650
Then don't call me ma'am.

476
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:57,690
Really?

477
00:44:57,730 --> 00:44:58,730
That works.

478
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:02,400
Wait. Maybe not.

479
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:04,680
Is she really crazy?

480
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:06,190
By the way,

481
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,110
how did you know the dye maker would die?

482
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:15,390
The arrowhead from Song's corpse
had a letter which means 'to stain'.

483
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:20,150
My clever head figured out
it's a clue to his next killing...

484
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:24,850
The arrowhead!

485
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:41,140
Oh no! Brother!

486
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:42,270
Who's that?

487
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:44,770
- Must be the dead man's brother.
- What?

488
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:47,720
He only has a younger sister.

489
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:56,150
Right. He does.

490
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,480
Then who am I?

491
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,350
Well, I'm...

492
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:03,020
I'm his sister.

493
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:25,970
Then who is he?

494
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:30,230
- Well, I'm her Hus...
- My servant.

495
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:32,570
His name is Bang-ja.

496
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:36,900
Greet me.

497
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,100
Hello, ma'am.

498
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:45,730
He's dressed in disguise to protect me.

499
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:50,350
He will be examined soon. Please be quick.

500
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:52,640
- Of course, sir.
- Let's go.

501
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:54,190
Thank you, sir!

502
00:46:55,690 --> 00:46:56,690
A servant?

503
00:46:58,390 --> 00:47:00,680
Find the arrowhead, Bang-ja.

504
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:20,100
Are you all right?

505
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:24,640
Our lady lost consciousness
from the shock of his death!

506
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:27,730
Oh no, ma'am!

507
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:37,980
I'm fine. Put me down.

508
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:39,770
No.

509
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:42,940
Put me down! Let me off!

510
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,480
Pretend you're asleep, will you?

511
00:47:45,810 --> 00:47:49,060
People will think it's odd if you don't.

512
00:47:56,140 --> 00:48:00,520
You really don't remember anything?

513
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:03,020
I don't even know my name.

514
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,640
Then let's make one.

515
00:48:09,770 --> 00:48:10,770
My name?

516
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,980
We'll have to go around together like this.

517
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:18,390
I can't just call you 'hey you'.

518
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:23,140
And I'm an outstanding name maker.

519
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:25,390
Listen and choose.

520
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:32,320
Bertha, Dorcas, Edna, Gretel...

521
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:34,310
Don't get cute with me.

522
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,520
Let's see.

523
00:48:41,230 --> 00:48:43,480
Your fair skin is like the moon.

524
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:47,810
'Wol' means 'moon'. And you're young.

525
00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:49,850
How about Wol-young?

526
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:54,100
That's a pretty name.

527
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:03,060
Simplified 'A-gyo'...

528
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:06,520
It could mean someone
who makes ox hide glue.

529
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:09,270
It could also mean shinbone.

530
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:12,350
So, it could be a hunter or a butcher next.

531
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:15,400
That's so weird.

532
00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:19,690
I haven't seen her eat in days.

533
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:23,390
Even if your parents die, you feel hungry.

534
00:49:23,810 --> 00:49:25,390
Why won't she eat?

535
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:28,190
I knew a crazy girl back home.

536
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:32,480
She'd run around everywhere
without eating for almost a week.

537
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:35,020
And you know how strong they are?

538
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:37,810
They can drag a couple of men no problem!

539
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:42,560
You should be careful, sir.

540
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:46,060
Don't get involved because she's pretty.

541
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:47,890
Hi.

542
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:50,810
The flower suits you.

543
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,810
Now, let's see you smile.

544
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,440
Smile.

545
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:59,940
Don't act pretty. Just
smile like the others.

546
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:05,730
See? She's crazy.

547
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:07,980
- Let's go home.
- Yes, sir.

548
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:25,690
Hot! Hot!

549
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:16,190
I'll protect you, sir!

550
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:39,980
Stay still!

551
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:20,310
Sir!

552
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,020
What about me?

553
00:52:34,810 --> 00:52:35,850
Are you all right?

554
00:52:36,810 --> 00:52:37,810
I'm fine.

555
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:40,440
You got cut. How could you be fine?

556
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:42,480
- Let's see.
- It's okay.

557
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,650
Don't be stubborn! Give me your hand.

558
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:04,350
Who were those men?

559
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:11,770
Why change subjects? You saw it.

560
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:18,890
Some people can heal faster than others.

561
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:21,360
What if I'm not human?

562
00:53:22,810 --> 00:53:27,020
What if I'm a monster like him?

563
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:35,810
You're not a monster.

564
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:40,020
Vampires can't last in the sun like you.

565
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:43,600
They crave human blood, but you don't.

566
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:46,390
So, you're not a monster.

567
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:48,970
What do you know?

568
00:53:55,390 --> 00:53:58,890
I can't control my powers.

569
00:53:59,350 --> 00:54:02,850
I can even sense the air
passing through me.

570
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:07,690
When I smell blood, I feel
a suffocating thirst.

571
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:10,360
At this rate,

572
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:16,020
I could bite your neck like that monster.

573
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:23,360
You may become a monster after biting me,

574
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,520
but my neck is fine.

575
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:29,810
Your fear of becoming a monster
means you're not one yet.

576
00:54:30,890 --> 00:54:36,140
All I see is a good person who's
afraid of becoming a monster.

577
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:41,060
Aren't you afraid of me?

578
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,360
I trust the human in you, Wol-young.

579
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:51,600
I trust you will not to become a monster.

580
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:57,230
You're stronger and more
upright than any man.

581
00:54:57,270 --> 00:55:00,230
I'm not afraid of you.

582
00:55:00,350 --> 00:55:04,350
I'll always keep my neck open to you.

583
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:33,770
Why don't you use the front gate?

584
00:55:35,310 --> 00:55:38,310
I searched throughout Ganghwa.
I can't find her, sir.

585
00:55:38,770 --> 00:55:39,810
This is...

586
00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:46,400
No sign at all?

587
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:49,600
No, sir.

588
00:55:50,310 --> 00:55:51,810
I think she left Ganghwa.

589
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:53,440
Give me that.

590
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:55,140
Look.

591
00:55:57,770 --> 00:55:59,230
Still can't find her?

592
00:56:03,190 --> 00:56:05,110
Get it now?

593
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:06,520
Have you seen her?

594
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:10,690
Forget it. Go back home.

595
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:12,570
No, sir. I'll stay and protect you.

596
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:16,270
It's okay. Just take
good care of yourself.

597
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:18,140
Then I'll be going, sir.

598
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:22,180
- Use the gate!
- Yes, sir.

599
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:27,850
Wait.

600
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:31,640
Am I the monster in this book?

601
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:37,770
Does this look like me?

602
00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:39,850
I don't look like this!

603
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:42,020
My teeth are straight.

604
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:50,940
And it says vampires burn in the sunlight.

605
00:56:52,350 --> 00:56:53,350
But I'm fine!

606
00:56:54,230 --> 00:56:58,570
That's for vampires who
sucked human blood.

607
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:05,570
So, if I suck blood, I'd
be afraid of sunlight too?

608
00:57:08,390 --> 00:57:10,470
Vampires must drink blood to survive.

609
00:57:10,810 --> 00:57:14,310
If they don't, they'll go weak.

610
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:16,020
Then

611
00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:18,060
they'll die!

612
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:22,060
Look.

613
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:25,070
You're scared of me, right?

614
00:57:29,310 --> 00:57:30,310
Yes.

615
00:57:30,890 --> 00:57:33,770
What's so funny here?

616
00:57:33,810 --> 00:57:35,890
I could hear you outside!

617
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:38,770
Think of our history together!

618
00:57:38,810 --> 00:57:40,480
All those nights together!

619
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:42,980
How can you ditch me for a crazy girl?

620
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:46,600
You'll regret leaving me someday, sir!

621
00:57:48,270 --> 00:57:50,150
You're so lucky, bitch.

622
00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:57,140
If I ever bite someone, he'd be the first.

623
00:57:58,020 --> 00:57:59,020
By the way, sir.

624
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:02,560
I must have menopause.

625
00:58:02,850 --> 00:58:05,390
I keep getting hot flashes.

626
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,190
See? I'm burning inside!

627
00:58:08,350 --> 00:58:09,270
I'm hot! Get back!

628
00:58:09,310 --> 00:58:10,640
Don't do this!

629
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:11,770
Get back, sir!

630
00:58:11,810 --> 00:58:13,730
What are you staring at?

631
00:58:13,770 --> 00:58:15,690
Get ready! We have to go!

632
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:19,560
Don't be a burden on us.

633
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:21,770
She won't budge.

634
00:58:21,810 --> 00:58:22,730
Why you!

635
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:25,100
Stop! You're asking to die!

636
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:26,810
What's with you, sir?

637
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:34,820
What are you doing?

638
00:58:34,850 --> 00:58:36,020
Stop it, sir!

639
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:37,520
Are you a pervert?

640
00:58:44,810 --> 00:58:46,560
What's wrong?

641
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:49,980
Get away! Stop!

642
00:59:13,770 --> 00:59:18,150
Did it really say 'A-gyo' on the arrowhead?

643
00:59:18,730 --> 00:59:22,520
Why? You think I can't even read?

644
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:23,890
Just let me see.

645
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:28,820
No way! I'm mad you think I can't read!

646
00:59:28,850 --> 00:59:30,690
I'll bite you!

647
00:59:35,390 --> 00:59:37,640
It's a simplified character.

648
00:59:38,230 --> 00:59:41,320
Simplified characters were made to...

649
00:59:41,350 --> 00:59:42,520
Wol-gyo.

650
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:45,440
You read it wrong.

651
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:47,150
I knew it was Wol-gyo.

652
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,020
Of course, I knew.

653
00:59:50,770 --> 00:59:52,940
I was right again.

654
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:56,360
This pond is called Wol-gyo.

655
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:00,020
Ganghwa Hall used to be here.

656
01:00:00,270 --> 01:00:01,650
Ganghwa Hall?

657
01:00:01,690 --> 01:00:05,520
Some say it's the revenge of those
who died in the Ganghwa Hall fire.

658
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:10,270
Then the next victim must
be connected to this place.

659
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:15,390
If the fire here was plotted
to kill innocent lives,

660
01:00:16,190 --> 01:00:20,480
he's killing those
involved to get revenge?

661
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:23,230
That ghastly fool!

662
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:30,230
He must have his reasons.

663
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:37,140
The monster must've once been a human too.

664
01:00:39,230 --> 01:00:40,230
Like me.

665
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,650
There's sadness in his eyes.

666
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:57,190
Didn't you lose your memory?

667
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:00,390
How do you know about Ganghwa Hall?

668
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:03,390
I'm not sure.

669
01:01:04,730 --> 01:01:06,360
It just came to me.

670
01:01:08,270 --> 01:01:10,850
I saw Ganghwa Hall here.

671
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:39,730
The arrowhead pointed to Ganghwa Hall?

672
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:43,520
The next victim is connected
to the fire 30 years ago.

673
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:47,230
Ask realtors and find out
why Ganghwa Hall is gone.

674
01:01:47,850 --> 01:01:50,100
I'll investigate more on Ha Byung-eun.

675
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:01,070
He must be Ha Byung-eun's father.

676
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:18,820
Why hold a sacrifice instead of
wishing his son's spirit well?

677
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:57,230
Nan?

678
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:05,360
Have you forgotten?

679
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:10,400
Did you think it was over?

680
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:16,600
You watched me die, but lived comfortably?

681
01:03:19,890 --> 01:03:23,430
Just as you murdered my wife and son,

682
01:03:24,230 --> 01:03:26,860
I'll destroy you and your family!

683
01:03:29,060 --> 01:03:30,440
Forgive me!

684
01:03:33,350 --> 01:03:36,190
I deserve to die!

685
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:16,520
I couldn't protect you to the end.

686
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:18,520
I'm sorry.

687
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:23,140
Son!

688
01:04:31,390 --> 01:04:32,930
- Ganghwa Hall?
- Yes.

689
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:37,440
I heard Ganghwa Hall
burned down 30 years ago.

690
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:39,020
What happened?

691
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:41,940
It wasn't just a fire.

692
01:04:44,810 --> 01:04:45,810
It was treason.

693
01:04:46,690 --> 01:04:47,480
Treason?

694
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:53,060
They say that the Crown
Prince was poisoned there.

695
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:59,230
So, the Jeong family was annihilated
and a pond was made there.

696
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:03,860
The Jeong family owned Ganghwa Hall?

697
01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:10,980
He killed your son!

698
01:05:11,020 --> 01:05:12,190
Who is he?

699
01:05:12,890 --> 01:05:13,810
Jeong In-yul!

700
01:05:13,850 --> 01:05:16,940
The Jeong family has been loyal
to the king for generations.

701
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:20,730
Jeong In-yul and his father
were very loyal too.

702
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:26,480
But they were executed
for plotting treason.

703
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:28,070
Jeong In-yul...

704
01:05:28,890 --> 01:05:32,770
He's back from hell!

705
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:34,770
Jeong In-yul...

706
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:48,940
A royal award?

707
01:05:49,310 --> 01:05:52,770
For those who reported the
Crown Prince's murder?

708
01:05:53,690 --> 01:05:55,940
Hong Jeong-ho, Song Gap-young, Ha Il-ju...

709
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:57,480
Hong...

710
01:05:57,890 --> 01:05:59,680
Hong Tae-mun, Song Pil-geun, Ha Byung-eun!

711
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:03,020
He killed the sons of those here in order!

712
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:05,230
There must be two more names.

713
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:06,640
Choi Il-kyu?

714
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:09,770
- The owner of Yeon-mi Lodge?
- Yes.

715
01:06:10,350 --> 01:06:13,690
The land and building
belonged to the Jeong family.

716
01:06:13,730 --> 01:06:17,070
But after they died, everything
went to Choi Il-kyu.

717
01:06:17,810 --> 01:06:21,270
Then the next target must
be his son, Jae-kyung.

718
01:06:21,690 --> 01:06:26,110
He knew his turn would come,
so he read up on monsters.

719
01:06:26,690 --> 01:06:27,690
Jeong In-yul...

720
01:06:28,190 --> 01:06:31,820
He's getting revenge on those
who reported the treason.

721
01:06:36,060 --> 01:06:37,560
Today's the 12th!

722
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:39,020
What about it, sir?

723
01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:40,600
Hong Tae-mun died on the 3rd.

724
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:41,890
Song died on the 6th.

725
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:43,570
And Ha died on the 9th!

726
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:46,520
There's no time!

727
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:50,480
We can't fight a vampire
with our bare hands!

728
01:06:52,810 --> 01:06:54,850
Then how do we stop it, sir?

729
01:06:55,230 --> 01:06:57,690
Strike it with silver or burn it!

730
01:06:58,140 --> 01:07:02,060
If you don't burn its heart,
it could be revived with blood.

731
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:43,520
The killer will come here tonight.

732
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:48,020
He has extraordinary skills
and won't be easy to fight.

733
01:07:48,350 --> 01:07:49,810
You must shoot...

734
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:59,730
You must shoot him with fiery arrows!

735
01:08:00,060 --> 01:08:01,060
Yes, sir!

736
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:25,640
Jeong In-yul!

737
01:09:28,810 --> 01:09:32,560
You and your father
poisoned the Crown Prince!

738
01:09:32,770 --> 01:09:35,400
But you want revenge?

739
01:09:35,770 --> 01:09:37,560
Rather than repent,

740
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,560
you took innocent lives!

741
01:09:39,940 --> 01:09:42,190
You will pay for your crime!

742
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:44,980
Pay for my crime?

743
01:09:46,060 --> 01:09:48,850
You'll die here too!

744
01:10:13,270 --> 01:10:14,600
Pain, you say?

745
01:10:15,690 --> 01:10:17,980
What do you know about never-ending pain!

746
01:10:18,810 --> 01:10:22,440
How dare you tell me to pay for my crime!

747
01:10:27,770 --> 01:10:28,940
Put him down.

748
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:35,350
Though you seek blood now,

749
01:10:35,730 --> 01:10:38,230
were you not once a man of honor?

750
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:44,400
Since your memory isn't back,

751
01:10:45,390 --> 01:10:47,930
you must not know how you died.

752
01:10:51,350 --> 01:10:52,350
Why?

753
01:10:53,230 --> 01:10:55,480
Think your death was different from mine?

754
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:59,270
When you remember how you
died and who killed you,

755
01:10:59,810 --> 01:11:03,270
you'll become just like me.

756
01:11:03,310 --> 01:11:04,310
No.

757
01:11:04,730 --> 01:11:06,650
I won't be a monster like you.

758
01:11:07,270 --> 01:11:08,560
Drink blood.

759
01:11:09,770 --> 01:11:12,440
Find your painful memories

760
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:16,270
and get revenge on the
day of the full moon!

761
01:12:01,190 --> 01:12:02,690
You must live!

762
01:12:25,670 --> 01:12:28,920
You want to turn me into a real vampire?

763
01:12:31,790 --> 01:12:34,080
Why did you try to give me blood?

764
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:38,290
I wanted to save you.

765
01:12:41,170 --> 01:12:42,170
Why?

766
01:12:46,750 --> 01:12:49,000
What if I bite you?

767
01:12:49,750 --> 01:12:51,290
You'll become a vampire too.

768
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:54,710
Do you wish to live on innocent blood?

769
01:12:56,210 --> 01:13:00,500
Even so, I would never drink
someone else's blood.

770
01:13:06,170 --> 01:13:09,880
Then I'll bite Seo-pil for you,
so you won't be lonely.

771
01:13:22,210 --> 01:13:25,210
Being with the crazy girl,
you've lost your mind, sir.

772
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:04,960
Yes, ma'am.

773
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:18,090
<i>SIR HA IL-JU AND CHOI IL-KYU DIED</i>

774
01:14:19,670 --> 01:14:24,380
<i>No warnings this time?
There must be another target.</i>

775
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:29,670
Seo-pil? Wake up.

776
01:14:29,710 --> 01:14:31,630
Let me hold your hand.

777
01:14:32,090 --> 01:14:33,970
I said wake up!

778
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:04,540
<i>I'll bite Seo-pil for you.</i>

779
01:15:18,290 --> 01:15:20,460
Get dressed, already!

780
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:21,840
Yes, sir.

781
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:24,790
Someone will die in 3 days.

782
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:27,170
We must find the last informer before then.

783
01:15:40,630 --> 01:15:43,670
Choi Il-kyu must have the royal award too.

784
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:47,880
Why hide a proud certificate?

785
01:15:49,340 --> 01:15:51,470
Was he ashamed of it?

786
01:16:01,170 --> 01:16:02,920
The full moon is in 3 days.

787
01:16:03,380 --> 01:16:05,630
It's when the spirits'
powers are the strongest!

788
01:16:05,670 --> 01:16:06,670
Wait!

789
01:16:07,290 --> 01:16:09,210
The Full Moon Fest...

790
01:16:10,130 --> 01:16:11,670
His Majesty will be here!

791
01:16:11,710 --> 01:16:12,710
Sir?

792
01:16:13,170 --> 01:16:14,550
Please run away.

793
01:16:15,630 --> 01:16:17,590
I can't protect you any longer!

794
01:16:32,420 --> 01:16:34,250
What do you fools want?

795
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:35,290
Sir!

796
01:16:36,130 --> 01:16:39,050
Stay back. I'll handle them.

797
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,000
But...

798
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:45,090
I'm immortal now, sir.

799
01:16:45,750 --> 01:16:47,170
My body is on fire.

800
01:16:47,540 --> 01:16:49,670
I can't control my new powers!

801
01:16:50,130 --> 01:16:52,510
- Seo-pil! Actually...
- Listen!

802
01:16:52,540 --> 01:16:56,040
I'll have mercy and give you time to run.

803
01:16:56,090 --> 01:17:00,090
Or else today will be
your last day as humans!

804
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:05,630
Foolish thugs!

805
01:17:06,670 --> 01:17:11,000
I'll feast off your blood!

806
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,750
I drew the bite marks on you!

807
01:17:26,540 --> 01:17:28,370
You have what I want.

808
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,000
If you give it to me, I'll go quietly.

809
01:17:37,210 --> 01:17:39,210
This will help you decide.

810
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:44,500
Stop!

811
01:18:09,130 --> 01:18:13,920
When I awoke in the mountain,
a monk gave it to me.

812
01:18:15,590 --> 01:18:17,510
The case 30 years ago...

813
01:18:18,250 --> 01:18:21,380
Maybe the perpetrators and
victims should be switched.

814
01:18:22,210 --> 01:18:25,170
Those thugs are trying to hide something!

815
01:18:25,590 --> 01:18:29,090
What did they want? What was inside?

816
01:18:31,460 --> 01:18:36,090
It was a scroll with strange secret codes.

817
01:18:36,130 --> 01:18:37,130
Secret codes?

818
01:18:38,750 --> 01:18:41,590
My clever brain would've solved it!

819
01:18:41,630 --> 01:18:42,920
What a pity.

820
01:18:43,790 --> 01:18:44,790
Dang!

821
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:46,880
- Why you little!
- What?

822
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:48,090
I remember!

823
01:18:58,750 --> 01:19:01,960
Secret codes are written
with certain patterns.

824
01:19:02,250 --> 01:19:04,880
If you find the pattern, it can be read.

825
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:20,000
Where's that clever brain of yours?

826
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:21,210
Huh, sir?

827
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,000
I knew it!

828
01:19:51,790 --> 01:19:52,790
I was wrong.

829
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,090
Could you write up another one?

830
01:19:59,540 --> 01:20:01,500
Right here! Just bite him!

831
01:20:15,630 --> 01:20:16,880
Get back, sir.

832
01:20:19,290 --> 01:20:20,870
You're confusing me!

833
01:20:31,710 --> 01:20:32,710
Wait!

834
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:34,920
They used Korean alphabet!

835
01:20:38,710 --> 01:20:43,130
The 1st and 3rd lines are consonants
written with vertical symmetry.

836
01:20:43,170 --> 01:20:46,960
The middle line has vowels
drawn with triangles.

837
01:20:47,460 --> 01:20:50,920
The circles mean 'A'.
The triangles mean 'O' or 'U'.

838
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:54,710
Circles with lines mean 'E' and so on.

839
01:21:00,630 --> 01:21:04,880
<i>POISON THE CROWN PRINCE AND FRAME
JEONG IN-YUL AND HIS FATHER</i>

840
01:21:05,590 --> 01:21:06,590
I knew it!

841
01:21:08,380 --> 01:21:11,590
Those who reported the treason
were the real traitors!

842
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,040
What do you mean?

843
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:15,880
It's a conspiracy pact.

844
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:18,630
The Crown Prince's death was fabricated!

845
01:21:19,130 --> 01:21:20,920
Those who poisoned him

846
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:25,000
framed it on Jeong In-yul
and his father as treason!

847
01:21:27,540 --> 01:21:30,710
So, Jeong In-yul is
getting revenge on them?

848
01:21:31,170 --> 01:21:33,420
What do you know about never-ending pain!

849
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:36,050
I don't know how he became a vampire.

850
01:21:36,380 --> 01:21:38,340
But by killing the traitors' sons,

851
01:21:38,670 --> 01:21:41,630
he wanted them to suffer
more pain than death.

852
01:21:42,460 --> 01:21:44,880
He'll kill the last traitor's son next!

853
01:21:46,710 --> 01:21:48,130
Song Gap-young.

854
01:21:48,460 --> 01:21:50,130
Ha Il-ju.

855
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:51,920
Choi Il-kyu.

856
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:53,340
And

857
01:21:53,380 --> 01:21:54,630
Kim...

858
01:21:57,210 --> 01:21:58,790
And who, sir?

859
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:02,130
Kim Shin?

860
01:22:03,420 --> 01:22:04,420
Kim Shin?

861
01:22:05,290 --> 01:22:07,210
Your father, sir?

862
01:22:09,340 --> 01:22:11,340
Jeong In-yul knew me.

863
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:15,340
How dare you tell me to pay for my crime!

864
01:22:15,790 --> 01:22:18,170
He knows I'm the last informer's son.

865
01:22:21,090 --> 01:22:22,260
Kim Shin?

866
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:41,220
What brings you here, Min?

867
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:26,040
Give me blood.

868
01:23:28,130 --> 01:23:29,130
I want...

869
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:32,540
blood.

870
01:23:56,460 --> 01:23:58,590
The subjects are watching.

871
01:23:59,170 --> 01:24:00,170
Let them.

872
01:24:01,590 --> 01:24:04,880
I should hold my beloved's
hand on a night like this.

873
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,670
Mother!

874
01:24:07,710 --> 01:24:09,290
Father!

875
01:24:10,590 --> 01:24:11,630
Prince!

876
01:24:12,130 --> 01:24:14,470
Our son must've had a bad dream.

877
01:24:21,340 --> 01:24:25,090
What happened 30 years ago?

878
01:24:28,380 --> 01:24:32,300
Jeong In-yul is the one who called me here.

879
01:24:32,540 --> 01:24:34,870
Jeong In-yul died!

880
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:38,170
I saw it with my own eyes!

881
01:24:38,630 --> 01:24:42,550
If you don't tell me,
I'll hear it from him.

882
01:24:43,090 --> 01:24:44,420
I did it for you!

883
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:48,460
Did you make a wish?

884
01:24:51,340 --> 01:24:52,340
Yes, sir.

885
01:24:52,630 --> 01:24:55,130
I wished for His Majesty's

886
01:24:55,170 --> 01:24:57,590
<i>JEONG IN-YUL</i>
quick recovery, Your Highness.

887
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:05,160
You make me an unfilial son.

888
01:25:05,190 --> 01:25:07,610
How is that so, Your Highness?

889
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:12,780
The world knows you tend to
His Majesty every night.

890
01:25:12,820 --> 01:25:15,610
I just did what a subject should.

891
01:25:17,070 --> 01:25:18,070
I was kidding.

892
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:22,610
Your Highness?

893
01:25:23,190 --> 01:25:24,820
What did you wish for?

894
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:28,660
I wished for Joseon

895
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:32,280
to be returned to its owner.

896
01:25:33,690 --> 01:25:36,360
Joseon belongs to His Majesty and you, sir.

897
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:40,610
A king should not be the
owner of a country.

898
01:25:41,690 --> 01:25:44,770
The people should be.

899
01:25:46,650 --> 01:25:48,990
Joseon doesn't belong to the people now.

900
01:25:50,610 --> 01:25:53,610
Those who must work for
the people rule them.

901
01:25:54,030 --> 01:25:56,780
They make factions and fight
to keep what's theirs.

902
01:25:57,070 --> 01:25:59,950
They try to control the
king and alienate others.

903
01:26:00,650 --> 01:26:03,030
They frame their opposers as traitors.

904
01:26:05,490 --> 01:26:07,370
They're the ones who own Joseon.

905
01:26:10,900 --> 01:26:12,280
When I become king,

906
01:26:13,690 --> 01:26:17,440
I'll take Joseon away from them
and give it back to the people.

907
01:26:19,690 --> 01:26:21,570
I trust you will, sir.

908
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:26,150
See the lanterns?

909
01:26:26,690 --> 01:26:30,150
Do you know what the people wished for?

910
01:26:31,940 --> 01:26:34,270
The people make small cries.

911
01:26:34,740 --> 01:26:37,320
It's their leaders who raise their voices.

912
01:26:42,740 --> 01:26:46,620
Joseon doesn't need people
to talk for the civilians.

913
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:50,820
We need people to listen
to their small cries.

914
01:26:51,650 --> 01:26:59,280
I want to make it so that civilians
will not suffer from hunger and pain.

915
01:27:03,190 --> 01:27:06,190
Did you find anything?

916
01:27:09,780 --> 01:27:12,990
It's been long since I
sent you to Ganghwa Hall.

917
01:27:13,740 --> 01:27:15,660
Promise me first, sir.

918
01:27:15,690 --> 01:27:17,270
You found a way?

919
01:27:18,030 --> 01:27:19,030
Tell me.

920
01:27:20,820 --> 01:27:22,240
Why are you hesitating?

921
01:27:22,780 --> 01:27:27,490
Do you wish to see your
entire family be annihilated?

922
01:27:37,570 --> 01:27:38,450
What is it?

923
01:27:38,490 --> 01:27:40,410
The Crown Prince has passed away!

924
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:41,440
What?

925
01:27:42,860 --> 01:27:43,860
But how?

926
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:46,900
Sir! Sir!

927
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:49,690
Please run away! Your
father's been arrested!

928
01:27:49,740 --> 01:27:50,740
My father? Why?

929
01:27:50,780 --> 01:27:53,240
That he poisoned His Highness...

930
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:54,570
That's preposterous!

931
01:28:00,030 --> 01:28:02,120
Your Highness! You must leave at once.

932
01:28:02,570 --> 01:28:03,860
What do you mean?

933
01:28:04,610 --> 01:28:05,690
Where is His Highness?

934
01:28:09,030 --> 01:28:11,530
The young prince is in danger.
Please change.

935
01:28:17,900 --> 01:28:18,900
Let's go.

936
01:28:21,190 --> 01:28:22,190
Where are you going?

937
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:25,660
You know very well that my
father would never do this.

938
01:28:25,690 --> 01:28:26,770
He's been framed!

939
01:28:26,820 --> 01:28:30,700
Those who killed His Highness
will be after the prince.

940
01:28:43,820 --> 01:28:44,820
Your Highness!

941
01:28:44,860 --> 01:28:46,280
Please follow me.

942
01:30:04,690 --> 01:30:05,690
Your Highness?

943
01:30:05,740 --> 01:30:06,780
Please sit here.

944
01:30:11,320 --> 01:30:13,360
They won't come here.

945
01:30:16,150 --> 01:30:17,150
Thank you.

946
01:30:19,070 --> 01:30:21,320
How could you come in here?

947
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:23,110
Haven't you heard about this ship?

948
01:30:23,150 --> 01:30:24,440
It's a revolt.

949
01:30:24,690 --> 01:30:28,150
We must protect the prince
until things settle down.

950
01:30:34,650 --> 01:30:35,530
In-yul!

951
01:30:35,610 --> 01:30:36,610
Run away!

952
01:30:37,860 --> 01:30:41,150
Protect them no matter what!

953
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:46,240
Hurry!

954
01:30:51,240 --> 01:30:53,660
But it's treason, sir! I can't do it.

955
01:30:53,690 --> 01:30:54,690
You fool!

956
01:30:56,030 --> 01:30:57,490
It's not treason.

957
01:30:58,440 --> 01:31:01,940
The Crown Prince becoming king is treason!

958
01:31:03,530 --> 01:31:08,120
He's filled with absurd ideals!
If he becomes king, Joseon will fall!

959
01:31:09,070 --> 01:31:12,320
<i>A country does not thrive on ideals alone!</i>

960
01:31:13,110 --> 01:31:19,650
<i>The only way to save your family
is to bring down the Crown Prince!</i>

961
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:32,530
What are you doing?

962
01:31:38,030 --> 01:31:39,030
Please...

963
01:31:39,860 --> 01:31:41,650
Please let the prince live?

964
01:31:54,990 --> 01:31:56,120
Open the door.

965
01:31:56,440 --> 01:31:58,020
Open it now!

966
01:31:58,940 --> 01:32:02,270
Just let the prince live!

967
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:05,110
Please save the prince!

968
01:32:05,820 --> 01:32:06,820
No!

969
01:32:11,610 --> 01:32:15,440
It would've been better to
die than to beg for life.

970
01:32:16,570 --> 01:32:17,570
You fool!

971
01:32:17,900 --> 01:32:22,530
If I didn't do that, our family
would've been annihilated!

972
01:32:23,070 --> 01:32:26,570
I abandoned my friend and the Crown Prince

973
01:32:27,070 --> 01:32:28,610
to save you!

974
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:35,240
You mean, this is all because of me?

975
01:32:36,030 --> 01:32:38,280
You did all that for me?

976
01:32:38,610 --> 01:32:41,490
Then what makes me different
from the monster?

977
01:32:42,110 --> 01:32:46,240
I lived well in a family that
thrived on innocent blood!

978
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:48,320
Then I'm a monster too!

979
01:33:06,110 --> 01:33:07,240
Scour the area!

980
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:09,360
Yes, sir!

981
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:20,440
Prince...

982
01:33:22,110 --> 01:33:23,440
You must survive.

983
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:26,370
Search there!

984
01:33:50,240 --> 01:33:51,320
Find them!

985
01:34:03,990 --> 01:34:05,280
Don't let them get away!

986
01:34:13,740 --> 01:34:15,410
Corner her and catch her!

987
01:34:36,700 --> 01:34:37,950
Mother?

988
01:34:37,990 --> 01:34:43,320
If snow falls before the balsam fades,

989
01:34:43,370 --> 01:34:47,750
I heard you can meet the one you miss.

990
01:34:48,330 --> 01:34:49,460
Prince?

991
01:34:49,910 --> 01:34:52,490
Where did you hear that?

992
01:34:52,540 --> 01:34:59,250
It doesn't matter for
me if the balsam fades.

993
01:34:59,700 --> 01:35:00,700
Why?

994
01:35:01,160 --> 01:35:03,990
Even if you can't meet the one you miss?

995
01:35:04,120 --> 01:35:08,870
I'll live with you and Father forever.

996
01:35:08,910 --> 01:35:11,990
I won't miss anyone.

997
01:35:34,790 --> 01:35:36,620
You were Sun...

998
01:35:41,580 --> 01:35:43,710
My son, Sun...

999
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:51,990
I didn't even hold your hand.

1000
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:56,670
You died...

1001
01:36:00,330 --> 01:36:03,330
before even calling me mother.

1002
01:36:08,120 --> 01:36:09,580
I'm sorry.

1003
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:14,830
I'm so sorry.

1004
01:36:29,410 --> 01:36:30,410
Your Highness!

1005
01:36:30,910 --> 01:36:31,950
I, Jeong In-yul,

1006
01:36:32,410 --> 01:36:35,660
was disloyal in being
deceived by a greedy friend.

1007
01:36:36,490 --> 01:36:40,030
I will punish him for harming
the Crown Prince and prince.

1008
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:48,320
I'll burn everything he
owns once and for all!

1009
01:36:49,450 --> 01:36:52,540
He will come tomorrow
during the Full Moon Fest.

1010
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:54,870
That puts His Majesty in harms way!

1011
01:36:55,240 --> 01:36:56,950
We must reveal everything.

1012
01:36:57,700 --> 01:36:59,120
Even if I must die,

1013
01:36:59,660 --> 01:37:02,370
I'll reveal your crimes, Father!

1014
01:37:08,330 --> 01:37:10,710
Lock him away at once!

1015
01:37:59,950 --> 01:38:00,950
Sir!

1016
01:38:02,240 --> 01:38:03,280
Stay back!

1017
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:09,040
<i>I'm their owner's son.
They'll never harm me.</i>

1018
01:38:11,580 --> 01:38:13,420
Stay back or else!

1019
01:38:13,660 --> 01:38:14,700
This sir...

1020
01:38:14,740 --> 01:38:16,950
This fool is dead!

1021
01:38:17,450 --> 01:38:19,160
I said stay back!

1022
01:38:22,490 --> 01:38:23,620
My toe!

1023
01:38:24,160 --> 01:38:25,910
- Are you all right?
- I have gout!

1024
01:39:00,290 --> 01:39:01,290
Giddy up!

1025
01:39:01,540 --> 01:39:02,540
Giddy up!

1026
01:39:03,870 --> 01:39:04,870
Giddy up!

1027
01:39:34,240 --> 01:39:35,240
Giddy up!

1028
01:39:37,370 --> 01:39:38,660
What are you doing?

1029
01:39:38,700 --> 01:39:40,660
I'll protect you! Grab the reins!

1030
01:39:41,240 --> 01:39:42,660
Seo-pil!

1031
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:57,290
My gout!

1032
01:41:55,660 --> 01:41:56,740
Were you scared?

1033
01:41:59,160 --> 01:42:03,410
Scared people will disdain
you if they own Joseon?

1034
01:42:06,700 --> 01:42:08,910
Scared you'll lose everything?

1035
01:42:12,580 --> 01:42:18,000
Scared my young son will
live and reveal your sins?

1036
01:42:47,790 --> 01:42:49,250
I've been waiting.

1037
01:42:51,200 --> 01:42:53,580
I could strike you in the heart.

1038
01:42:55,620 --> 01:42:58,410
Please don't hesitate, Wol-young.

1039
01:43:00,490 --> 01:43:05,160
You must be so angry to
have to come back like this.

1040
01:43:06,540 --> 01:43:07,790
I must die

1041
01:43:08,410 --> 01:43:11,910
so your anger can be
resolved in the least bit.

1042
01:43:13,330 --> 01:43:18,830
I hope this will pay for
some of my father's sins.

1043
01:43:19,580 --> 01:43:22,170
Your father did not
only take away my life,

1044
01:43:23,790 --> 01:43:25,670
but my son and husband too.

1045
01:43:26,790 --> 01:43:31,620
We just wanted to be together.

1046
01:43:33,830 --> 01:43:35,540
That's all we wanted.

1047
01:43:37,080 --> 01:43:38,080
But

1048
01:43:38,870 --> 01:43:42,660
you enjoyed the last 30 years
upon their unjust deaths.

1049
01:43:43,660 --> 01:43:45,290
You ask me to kill you?

1050
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:49,200
Fine.

1051
01:43:51,160 --> 01:43:53,040
I'll kill you again and again!

1052
01:44:08,120 --> 01:44:10,200
<i>I want to know who I am.</i>

1053
01:44:10,870 --> 01:44:15,330
<i>Perhaps you lived in the distant past.</i>

1054
01:44:15,660 --> 01:44:17,120
Maybe 100 years ago?

1055
01:44:17,700 --> 01:44:18,790
That long?

1056
01:44:19,870 --> 01:44:21,200
Then I'd be so old.

1057
01:44:21,410 --> 01:44:23,290
Shall I call you granny?

1058
01:44:23,330 --> 01:44:26,040
No! I'd rather be called a monster.

1059
01:45:52,540 --> 01:45:54,290
It was exactly 30 years ago.

1060
01:45:54,950 --> 01:45:57,490
Trying to save you, I became a monster.

1061
01:45:58,330 --> 01:45:59,330
But you!

1062
01:46:00,160 --> 01:46:03,660
To fill your filthy mouth,
you killed the Crown Prince!

1063
01:46:04,240 --> 01:46:06,030
And my father and I!

1064
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:11,080
Jeong In-yul!

1065
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:21,280
I know the truth to your unjust suffering!

1066
01:46:21,740 --> 01:46:25,240
I'll reveal everything, so stop this!

1067
01:46:26,410 --> 01:46:27,450
The truth?

1068
01:46:28,490 --> 01:46:29,410
That's right!

1069
01:46:29,450 --> 01:46:30,450
Tonight!

1070
01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:36,670
The truth will burn you alive!

1071
01:46:59,120 --> 01:47:00,120
No!

1072
01:47:11,240 --> 01:47:13,370
Die you evil monster!

1073
01:47:18,830 --> 01:47:20,750
You call me a monster?

1074
01:47:23,120 --> 01:47:25,620
After knowing what your father did to me?

1075
01:47:25,910 --> 01:47:29,120
How dare you call me a monster?

1076
01:47:29,540 --> 01:47:30,870
30 years ago,

1077
01:47:32,410 --> 01:47:35,410
you became a monster to save a friend.

1078
01:47:36,540 --> 01:47:37,580
But now!

1079
01:47:38,290 --> 01:47:42,210
You kill innocent people for revenge!

1080
01:47:42,580 --> 01:47:44,710
And threaten His Majesty's life!

1081
01:47:45,700 --> 01:47:47,990
You're just a monster!

1082
01:48:02,490 --> 01:48:03,620
Now, die!

1083
01:48:14,790 --> 01:48:15,870
Your Highness!

1084
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:18,620
You've done enough.

1085
01:48:18,870 --> 01:48:20,000
No, Your Highness!

1086
01:48:20,580 --> 01:48:23,250
He must die to finish my revenge.

1087
01:48:27,790 --> 01:48:30,750
Those who made us into
monsters are all dead.

1088
01:48:32,410 --> 01:48:33,540
Stop.

1089
01:48:36,330 --> 01:48:37,670
It's over now.

1090
01:48:42,200 --> 01:48:46,790
I don't know how to stop.

1091
01:48:48,660 --> 01:48:50,660
My father is still alive in my heart.

1092
01:48:51,830 --> 01:48:57,250
His Highness and the prince
must be alive in you too!

1093
01:48:57,490 --> 01:49:01,200
I can't stop here.

1094
01:49:26,990 --> 01:49:29,120
You know very well

1095
01:49:30,160 --> 01:49:33,660
that we should not have come back to life.

1096
01:49:35,950 --> 01:49:39,040
We're just monsters who crave human blood.

1097
01:49:41,910 --> 01:49:45,290
Though we've gotten our revenge,

1098
01:49:47,830 --> 01:49:51,040
we can only live on the
blood of innocent people.

1099
01:49:54,120 --> 01:49:55,830
We've done enough.

1100
01:49:57,330 --> 01:49:59,000
It's time to go.

1101
01:50:10,450 --> 01:50:11,910
I, Jeong In-yul,

1102
01:50:13,120 --> 01:50:15,200
shall go to the Crown Prince first.

1103
01:50:18,410 --> 01:50:20,620
Forgive me, Your Highness.

1104
01:51:05,990 --> 01:51:06,870
Your Highness!

1105
01:51:06,910 --> 01:51:08,080
Please go inside!

1106
01:51:31,950 --> 01:51:33,950
What is time?

1107
01:51:33,990 --> 01:51:36,490
Please hide from the sunlight!

1108
01:51:39,580 --> 01:51:44,670
Waiting is only possible in time.

1109
01:51:55,080 --> 01:51:57,830
But the balsam stain remains...

1110
01:52:01,540 --> 01:52:04,370
Will I meet the ones I miss?

1111
01:53:10,290 --> 01:53:12,170
I missed you so much.

1112
01:53:45,450 --> 01:53:46,740
30 years ago,

1113
01:53:47,080 --> 01:53:51,960
Kim Shin poisoned the Crown Prince
and framed the Jeong family.

1114
01:53:52,450 --> 01:53:55,540
Thus, seize all his assets and servants.

1115
01:53:55,870 --> 01:54:00,000
Although his son revealed everything,

1116
01:54:00,290 --> 01:54:06,620
Kim Min must also be
beheaded to uphold the law!

1117
01:54:16,540 --> 01:54:18,920
<i>A MONTH LATER</i>

1118
01:54:30,410 --> 01:54:33,240
I heard you've gone a little cuckoo.

1119
01:54:33,580 --> 01:54:34,870
Maybe a lot.

1120
01:54:37,200 --> 01:54:43,160
He's coming! He's coming for me!

1121
01:54:43,200 --> 01:54:46,040
Who? Who's coming for you?

1122
01:54:47,080 --> 01:54:48,620
He came in my dreams.

1123
01:54:49,490 --> 01:54:51,870
He said he's coming for me!

1124
01:54:52,870 --> 01:54:55,660
So weak for a young fellow.

1125
01:55:04,620 --> 01:55:06,370
If you're a man, state your name!

1126
01:55:06,410 --> 01:55:08,370
If you're a ghost, go away!

1127
01:55:16,790 --> 01:55:17,790
It's me!

1128
01:55:28,540 --> 01:55:30,420
I waited so long.

1129
01:55:39,870 --> 01:55:40,870
Your Majesty!

1130
01:55:43,700 --> 01:55:45,160
You're already dead.

1131
01:55:47,240 --> 01:55:50,410
Kim Min no longer exists in Joseon.

1132
01:55:52,700 --> 01:55:58,910
There are many things you
must do for me in secret.

1133
01:56:01,490 --> 01:56:04,450
What did His Majesty command?

1134
01:56:04,870 --> 01:56:06,580
A month ago, in Andong,

1135
01:56:06,870 --> 01:56:10,790
the dead started to come
back to life and eat people.

1136
01:56:11,200 --> 01:56:12,290
Man-eating dead?

1137
01:56:12,330 --> 01:56:13,330
Yes!

1138
01:56:13,450 --> 01:56:15,790
They exist but do not.

1139
01:56:15,990 --> 01:56:19,950
They are called zombies.

1140
01:56:20,330 --> 01:56:21,330
Oh really?

1141
01:56:22,160 --> 01:56:23,160
Good luck!

1142
01:56:23,290 --> 01:56:25,540
Wait! Come with me!

1143
01:56:34,700 --> 01:56:39,450
