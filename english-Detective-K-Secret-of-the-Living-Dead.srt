00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:40,630
your sins are no different
from those of vampires.

103
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:43,760

Vampires exist.

109
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,380
It's because you're not busy.

110
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,460

113
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:46,710
Such a pity that you think
the world is so puny.

114
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:51,010
In 1742, a report was made

115
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:54,340
about Scholar Choi and his servant.

116
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:57,880
The servant saw a mysterious light.

117
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,840
Then Choi vanished without a trace.

118
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,290

119
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,170

unbelievable incidents.

120
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:21,170
Who's to say vampires don't exist?

121
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,800
Do you have proof?

122
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,500
30 years ago,

123
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,960
a Westerners' ship headed for
China ran aground in Joseon.

124
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:32,000
There are records of
vampire sightings then.

125
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,120
Come on, sir.

126
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,960
Cut the nonsense and do
your detective work.

127
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,040
Aren't you paying me rent?

128
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:43,050
Stop roaming and go back
to your nice house.

129
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,920
Then I'll have to get married!

130
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,880
If you must, why not?

131
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:58,300
I don't wish to marry without love.

132
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,710
Then tell your father that.

133
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:04,300
- He decided who I'll marry.
- So what?

134
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:08,510
You're good at speaking your mind.
Can't you talk to your father?

135
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,040
It's your life, sir!

136
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,170
Just say no!

137
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:16,790
Say you're not marrying a
stranger without love.

138
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,880
I did!

139
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,960
I told him it's my life and
he can't decide for me.

140
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,500
And?

141
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:24,670
I got slapped.

142
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:28,760
He's firm.

143
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,670
I thought the Premier would be different.

144
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:32,880

Anticipation for the Full Moon Fest

146
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:39,710
is high throughout Joseon.

147
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:44,500
People of all ages are working hard

148
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:53,290
to prepare a greater fest than
the one 30 years ago, sir.

149
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:03,220
Recently, 10,000 people worked
on fortifying our forts.

150
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:09,550
It must be hard for them to work
for the Full Moon Fest too.

151
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:15,630
Thus, I shall grant a small reward
to the workers.

152
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:19,880
Set rice as the only tributary.

153
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:24,830
And have aristocrats pay
for the military cloth as well.

154
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:34,090
I, Premier Kim Shin, request
to speak, Your Majesty.

155
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:40,380
His Majesty's mercy and heart
for the people is like heaven.

156
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,670
However,

157
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:45,960
if aristocrats pay the same as peasants,

158
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,790
what makes them different, sir?

159
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:52,370
It'll destroy class distinction

160
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:55,550
and shake the basis of Joseon, sir.

161
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:58,720
Please, Your Majesty!

162
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:02,720
Please retract your command, sir!

163
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,840
Even the king can't have his way with him.

164
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:13,130
Any functional problems in getting married?

165
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,380
Why you little!

166
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:16,300
Excuse me.

167
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:44,210
Who?

168
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,590
It's scorched rice tea.

169
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:56,760
Thank you.

170
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:59,330
It has a rich, deep flavor.

171
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,250
I did a great job making it.

172
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,380
Let me introduce myself.

173
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,250
I'm the daughter of the
owner of Yeon-mi Lodge.

174
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,540
How could we be of help?

175
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:17,920
Recently, while repairing
building in Ganghwa,

176
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,960
the roof suddenly caved
in and many workers died.

177
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:27,590
While burying the dead,
two corpses were discovered.

178
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:32,340
One was a skeleton and
the other was burned.

179
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,010
However, the burnt one
wasn't decayed at all.

180
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,170
But that's not all!

181
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:41,040
While they went to report it,

182
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,090
The corpse disappeared!

183
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,040
Only the burnt corpse vanished!

184
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:49,010
Then another incident happened soon after.

185
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,550
It was quite peculiar.

186
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:56,050
Some say a man burned
to death by an invisible fire.

187
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:58,630
He died but was not dead.

188
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,300
He lived but did not live!

189
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:04,710
Some say it's the revenge of those
who died in the Ganghwa Hall fire.

190
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,170
The Full Moon Fest is taking
place after 30 years.

191
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:13,460
My father has been ordered
by the court to prepare it.

192
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:18,460
However, he is ill and can't
see to such problems.

193
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,880
I've come to ask you to
solve the mysteries for us.

194
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,460
It won't be easy.

195
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,710
Serial killings can't be ruled out.

196
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:31,840
I heard you are the best
in all of Joseon, sir.

197
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,250
I'm not the best.

198
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:41,040
I'm the best of the best!

199
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,460
It's sad that I can only
explain myself that way.

200
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,590
He's a little arrogant.

201
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:47,790
I see.

202
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,880
Let's talk accommodations.

203
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,500
Will it have two rooms
or one with living room?

204
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,210
One with living room, sir.

205
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,380
Inside bathroom or outside?

206
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,340
Inside, sir.

207
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,300
And breakfast?

208
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,550
Provided, sir.

209
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:00,840

The guest door is that way.

218
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,550
The owner's daughter asked me to come.

219
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:51,760
I'm a detective.

220
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:54,620
It's about the mysterious deaths here.

221
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,040
Your sister asked us to
come and investigate.

222
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:00,550
I don't know why she did that.

223
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,790
I don't know of such things.

00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,960
He's a very famous detective, sir.

226
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,130
He solved the fake silver case and
even had dinner with the king.

227
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,010
I don't think he knows.

228
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,210
What if I explain it like this?

229
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:37,050
He got drunk before His Majesty and said,

230
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,460
'This isn't your country, pal!'

231
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,630
After the rude fiasco,
he was sent into exile.

232
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,130
That's him.

233
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:48,170
He's Premier Kim Shin's...

almost peed on the way!

00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:31,250
Shouldn't they give us fried eggs at least?

This is why you don't make
deals with a middleman.

What is the Full Moon Fest that
the magistrate can't investigate?

262

would all gather to celebrate.

00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,260
Burning to death.

294
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:55,340
But the way he died shows no
sign of squirming in pain.

295
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:00,510
It means that he couldn't
move before he was burned.

- An invisible fire...
- And...

320
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:57,010
The Buddhist monk on the poster?

321
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,290
Did anyone come for his body?

322

You're the first to come for him.

00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:06,130
So, all you know is that
he's a Buddhist monk?

324
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:08,590
Why do you ask that?

325
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:09,880
Very well then.

326
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,960
Wait! Show me your identity tag!

327
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,920
Who are you, sir?

328
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,960
Didn't Sir Choi Jae-kyung mention us?

329
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,460
You're the detective from the capital?

330
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,210
Yes.

There's no case I can't solve.

332

- I'm the best detective in...
- Excuse me, sir.

333
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:37,760
Where did she go?

334
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:42,630
I wish to see Song Pil-geun's corpse.

335
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:44,130
That's impossible, sir.

336
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:46,960
The magistrate gave orders
never to show it to anyone.

337
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,250
Of course not! If the magistrate said so.

338
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:56,510
On second thought, maybe
he didn't say never.

339
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,870
There is no such thing as never.

340
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:03,710
- You could sneak a peek at night.
- Good.

341
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,260
- I'll come back at night.
- Yes, sir.

342
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,630
What did you draw, sir?

343
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:17,050
Isn't she the woman from before?

344
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,290
That lady...

345
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,500
Did you notice?

346
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,920
Well,

347
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,710
she was a bit odd and very strong.

348
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,790
She's gorgeous.

349
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,840
Not again.

350
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:31,830
Why draw a pretty woman
at a time like this?

351
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,800
I need it to investigate.

352
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,010
Investigate what?

353
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,880
If you want to meet her, just say it.

354
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,420
She's there wherever we go!

355
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:44,170
That means she's connected
to this case somehow.

356
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:48,550
- Then...
- Maybe...

357
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:52,170
She could be chasing us.

358
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:55,290
Us? Why, sir?

359
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,210
Sir! It's me!

360
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:02,040
You must find out who she is
and why she's after this case.

361
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:03,550
Yes, sir.

362
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:08,300
This rough chap looks suspicious.

363
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:10,800
It's a woman.

364
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,460
And she's pretty.

365
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:18,960
Are you going blind in your old age?

366
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,590
Forget it.

367
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:24,220
I'll find her. You can go back home.

368
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:25,250
No, sir!

369
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:28,830
I'll find this fool! I mean this woman!

370
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,630
Look.

371
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:39,250
There is soot in his nose.

372
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,540
He was burned when he was alive.

373
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:16,540
It appears we're here for the same purpose.

374
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:23,750
Would you like to take a look?

375
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:27,080
Or shall we fight and bring in the guards?

376
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:45,000
An invisible fire...

377
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:51,380
It seems he was fatally
wounded before burning.

378
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:54,250
Then the scar must be somewhere.

379
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:06,420
<i>While burying the dead,
two corpses were discovered.</i>

380
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:09,090
<i>The burnt one wasn't decayed at all.</i>

381
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,580
<i>Only the burnt corpse vanished!</i>

382
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,000
<i>Is it a real vampire?</i>

383
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:48,420
<i>The arrow precisely struck the heart.</i>

384
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:52,840
<i>He didn't just want the
blood, but to kill him.</i>

385
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:55,590
<i>'Yeom' means to stain.</i>

386
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:59,130
<i>Why did the killer leave a sign?</i>

387
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,290
<i>Perhaps a forewarned murder?</i>

388
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:06,460
This letter has something
to do with staining or dyes.

389
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:10,590
Go to the painting plant and
meet the painters for clues.

390
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:13,420
I'll search the dye house here.

391
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:21,000
<i>HA BYUNG-EUN</i>

392
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,840
Why are you here?

393
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:57,050
How long will you follow me?

394
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:01,260
I saw someone on fire too.

395
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,880
Where?

396
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,380
I'm not sure.

397
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:12,510
I'm not sure where, who,
or why I remember that.

398
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:18,220
He must've been killed by something
that looks human but is not.

399
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,380
Something that looks human but is not?

400
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:27,340
Are they really strong and fast?

401
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:29,720
And heal fast if they're hurt?

402
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:31,840
You know about vampires?

403
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,250
Vampires?

404
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,300
Vampires are immortal.

405
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:43,420
They don't get hurt or die.

406
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:45,880
Immortal?

407
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,000
I have a question.

408
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,750
You're definitely in my memory.

409
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:49,960
Who am I?

410
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,380
In becoming a monster,
your memory was lost.

411
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:56,880
If you want your memory back,

412
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,040
drink blood.

413
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,500
Are you all right?

414
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,920
You fool!

415
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:14,790
How dare you disturb the
laws of this world!

416
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:18,130
I know that you're behind
the ominous deaths!

417
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:21,130
How dare you try to live
by killing innocent people!

418
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:22,720
Innocent people?

419
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,420
Who?

420
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,540
How dare you!

421
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,590
Think you can get away with
murder because you're immortal?

422
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,750
I know how to banish you!

423
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,460
Do you want to remember?

424
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:39,380
Then watch this!

425
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:31,000
Sir! What happened!

426
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:37,090
We must get the arrow out.
Hold him down now!

427
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:41,970
That's a good idea.

428
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:45,220
But aren't we in the same class?
Stop giving me orders!

429
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,250
Hurry up!

430
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:50,170
I will, but watch it.

431
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,540
Sir?

432
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:48,050
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

433
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:54,670
Isn't she odd, sir?

434
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,920
Did you sense it too?

435
00:42:57,170 --> 00:42:58,170
You too, sir?

436
00:42:58,420 --> 00:42:59,420
Yes.

437
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:03,920
I thought she was strange from the start.

438
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:07,170
She goes around alone.

439
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:10,760
She talks down to you and gives commands.

440
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,670
She's out of this world, sir.

441
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:15,670
It all adds up to one thing.

442
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:17,290
What?

443
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:19,000
She's crazy.

444
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:23,750
Crazy girls don't wear flowers
on their heads these days.

445
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:27,670
Try all you want, but you can't fool me!

446
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:36,300
<i>If you want to remember, drink blood.</i>

447
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,920
<i>She fought off a vampire. Is she one too?</i>

448
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,920
<i>No, she's can't be.</i>

449
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,710
<i>If she is, she can't be fine in the sun.</i>

450
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:56,960
<i>And she wouldn't have saved me.</i>

451
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,790
<i>If he catches the monster
before I find my memory...</i>

452
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,920
<i>But she's similar to him.</i>

453
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:05,460
<i>He's arrogant, but has a useful brain.</i>

454
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,420
<i>She's quite arrogant.</i>

455
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:10,040
<i>But her ability to fight
him is quite useful.</i>

456
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:14,550
<i>With my brain and this woman's
body, we can catch the monster.</i>

457
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:15,670
<i>Work with her?</i>

458
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,050
<i>My brain and...</i>

459
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:18,840
<i>Seo-pil's body!</i>

460
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:21,090
Damn it!

461
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:22,380
This woman's body!

462
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:27,420
Oops. Did I say that out loud?

463
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:31,170
It's not what it sounded like.

464
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,500
- I mean your...
- If you help me,

465
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:35,630
I'll help you catch the monster.

466
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:36,620
But

467
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:38,500
you can't ask anything about me.

468
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:41,970
Agreed. But help you with what?

469
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,420
I lost my memory.

470
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:49,920
I want to know who I am.

471
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:51,670
Fine.

472
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:54,920
But there's one problem.

473
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:56,290
What is it?

474
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:57,510
You don't call me sir.

475
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,050
Then don't call me ma'am.

476
00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:00,090
Really?

477
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,130
That works.

478
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:04,800
Wait. Maybe not.

479
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:07,080
Is she really crazy?

480
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:08,590
By the way,

481
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,510
how did you know the dye maker would die?

482
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:17,790
The arrowhead from Song's corpse
had a letter which means 'to stain'.

483
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:22,550
My clever head figured out
it's a clue to his next killing...

484
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:27,250
The arrowhead!

485
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:43,540
Oh no! Brother!

486
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:44,670
Who's that?

487
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:47,170
- Must be the dead man's brother.
- What?

488
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:50,120
He only has a younger sister.

489
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:58,550
Right. He does.

490
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,880
Then who am I?

491
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,750
Well, I'm...

492
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:05,420
I'm his sister.

493
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:28,370
Then who is he?

494
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:32,630
- Well, I'm her Hus...
- My servant.

495
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:34,970
His name is Bang-ja.

496
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:39,300
Greet me.

497
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,500
Hello, ma'am.

498
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:48,130
He's dressed in disguise to protect me.

499
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:52,750
He will be examined soon. Please be quick.

500
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:55,040
- Of course, sir.
- Let's go.

501
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:56,590
Thank you, sir!

502
00:46:58,090 --> 00:46:59,090
A servant?

503
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:03,080
Find the arrowhead, Bang-ja.

504
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:22,500
Are you all right?

505
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:27,040
Our lady lost consciousness
from the shock of his death!

506
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:30,130
Oh no, ma'am!

507
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,380
I'm fine. Put me down.

508
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:42,170
No.

509
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:45,340
Put me down! Let me off!

510
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,880
Pretend you're asleep, will you?

511
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:51,460
People will think it's odd if you don't.

512
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:02,920
You really don't remember anything?

513
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,420
I don't even know my name.

514
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,040
Then let's make one.

515
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:13,170
My name?

516
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:16,380
We'll have to go around together like this.

517
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,790
I can't just call you 'hey you'.

518
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:25,540
And I'm an outstanding name maker.

519
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:27,790
Listen and choose.

520
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:34,720
Bertha, Dorcas, Edna, Gretel...

521
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:36,710
Don't get cute with me.

522
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:42,920
Let's see.

523
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:45,880
Your fair skin is like the moon.

524
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:50,210
'Wol' means 'moon'. And you're young.

525
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:52,250
How about Wol-young?

526
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:56,500
That's a pretty name.

527
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:05,460
Simplified 'A-gyo'...

528
00:49:06,130 --> 00:49:08,920
It could mean someone
who makes ox hide glue.

529
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:11,670
It could also mean shinbone.

530
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:14,750
So, it could be a hunter or a butcher next.

531
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:17,800
That's so weird.

532
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:22,090
I haven't seen her eat in days.

533
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:25,790
Even if your parents die, you feel hungry.

534
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:27,790
Why won't she eat?

535
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:30,590
I knew a crazy girl back home.

536
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,880
She'd run around everywhere
without eating for almost a week.

537
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:37,420
And you know how strong they are?

538
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:40,210
They can drag a couple of men no problem!

539
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:44,960
You should be careful, sir.

540
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:48,460
Don't get involved because she's pretty.

541
00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:50,290
Hi.

542
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:53,210
The flower suits you.

543
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,210
Now, let's see you smile.

544
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:56,840
Smile.

545
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:02,340
Don't act pretty. Just
smile like the others.

546
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,130
See? She's crazy.

547
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:10,380
- Let's go home.
- Yes, sir.

548
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,090
Hot! Hot!

549
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:18,590
I'll protect you, sir!

550
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:42,380
Stay still!

551
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:22,710
Sir!

552
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:25,420
What about me?

553
00:52:37,210 --> 00:52:38,250
Are you all right?

554
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:40,210
I'm fine.

555
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:42,840
You got cut. How could you be fine?

556
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:44,880
- Let's see.
- It's okay.

557
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:47,050
Don't be stubborn! Give me your hand.

558
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:06,750
Who were those men?

559
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:14,170
Why change subjects? You saw it.

560
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:21,290
Some people can heal faster than others.

561
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:23,760
What if I'm not human?

562
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:29,420
What if I'm a monster like him?

563
00:53:36,710 --> 00:53:38,210
You're not a monster.

564
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:42,420
Vampires can't last in the sun like you.

565
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:46,000
They crave human blood, but you don't.

566
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:48,790
So, you're not a monster.

567
00:53:49,790 --> 00:53:51,370
What do you know?

568
00:53:57,790 --> 00:54:01,290
I can't control my powers.

569
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:05,250
I can even sense the air
passing through me.

570
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:10,090
When I smell blood, I feel
a suffocating thirst.

571
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:12,760
At this rate,

572
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:18,420
I could bite your neck like that monster.

573
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:25,760
You may become a monster after biting me,

574
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,920
but my neck is fine.

575
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:32,210
Your fear of becoming a monster
means you're not one yet.

576
00:54:33,290 --> 00:54:38,540
All I see is a good person who's
afraid of becoming a monster.

577
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:43,460
Aren't you afraid of me?

578
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:48,760
I trust the human in you, Wol-young.

579
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:54,000
I trust you will not to become a monster.

580
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:59,630
You're stronger and more
upright than any man.

581
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:02,630
I'm not afraid of you.

582
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:06,750
I'll always keep my neck open to you.

583
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:36,170
Why don't you use the front gate?

584
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:40,710
I searched throughout Ganghwa.
I can't find her, sir.

585
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:42,210
This is...

586
00:55:47,590 --> 00:55:48,800
No sign at all?

587
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
No, sir.

588
00:55:52,710 --> 00:55:54,210
I think she left Ganghwa.

589
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:55,840
Give me that.

590
00:55:56,540 --> 00:55:57,540
Look.

591
00:56:00,170 --> 00:56:01,630
Still can't find her?

592
00:56:05,590 --> 00:56:07,510
Get it now?

593
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:08,920
Have you seen her?

594
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:13,090
Forget it. Go back home.

595
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:14,970
No, sir. I'll stay and protect you.

596
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,670
It's okay. Just take
good care of yourself.

597
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:20,540
Then I'll be going, sir.

598
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:24,580
- Use the gate!
- Yes, sir.

599
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:30,250
Wait.

600
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:34,040
Am I the monster in this book?

601
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:40,170
Does this look like me?

602
00:56:40,790 --> 00:56:42,250
I don't look like this!

603
00:56:42,670 --> 00:56:44,420
My teeth are straight.

604
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:53,340
And it says vampires burn in the sunlight.

605
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:55,750
But I'm fine!

606
00:56:56,630 --> 00:57:00,970
That's for vampires who
sucked human blood.

607
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:07,970
So, if I suck blood, I'd
be afraid of sunlight too?

608
00:57:10,790 --> 00:57:12,870
Vampires must drink blood to survive.

609
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:16,710
If they don't, they'll go weak.

610
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:18,420
Then

611
00:57:19,210 --> 00:57:20,460
they'll die!

612
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:24,460
Look.

613
00:57:26,090 --> 00:57:27,470
You're scared of me, right?

614
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:32,710
Yes.

615
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:36,170
What's so funny here?

616
00:57:36,210 --> 00:57:38,290
I could hear you outside!

617
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:41,170
Think of our history together!

618
00:57:41,210 --> 00:57:42,880
All those nights together!

619
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:45,380
How can you ditch me for a crazy girl?

620
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:49,000
You'll regret leaving me someday, sir!

621
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:52,550
You're so lucky, bitch.

622
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:59,540
If I ever bite someone, he'd be the first.

623
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:01,420
By the way, sir.

624
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:04,960
I must have menopause.

625
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:07,790
I keep getting hot flashes.

626
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:09,590
See? I'm burning inside!

627
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:11,670
I'm hot! Get back!

628
00:58:11,710 --> 00:58:13,040
Don't do this!

629
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:14,170
Get back, sir!

630
00:58:14,210 --> 00:58:16,130
What are you staring at?

631
00:58:16,170 --> 00:58:18,090
Get ready! We have to go!

632
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:21,960
Don't be a burden on us.

633
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,170
She won't budge.

634
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:25,130
Why you!

635
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:27,500
Stop! You're asking to die!

636
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:29,210
What's with you, sir?

637
00:58:36,090 --> 00:58:37,220
What are you doing?

638
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:38,420
Stop it, sir!

639
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:39,920
Are you a pervert?

640
00:58:47,210 --> 00:58:48,960
What's wrong?

641
00:58:50,590 --> 00:58:52,380
Get away! Stop!

642
00:59:16,170 --> 00:59:20,550
Did it really say 'A-gyo' on the arrowhead?

643
00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:24,920
Why? You think I can't even read?

644
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,290
Just let me see.

645
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:31,220
No way! I'm mad you think I can't read!

646
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:33,090
I'll bite you!

647
00:59:37,790 --> 00:59:40,040
It's a simplified character.

648
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:43,720
Simplified characters were made to...

649
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:44,920
Wol-gyo.

650
00:59:46,090 --> 00:59:47,840
You read it wrong.

651
00:59:48,170 --> 00:59:49,550
I knew it was Wol-gyo.

652
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,420
Of course, I knew.

653
00:59:53,170 --> 00:59:55,340
I was right again.

654
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,760
This pond is called Wol-gyo.

655
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,420
Ganghwa Hall used to be here.

656
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:04,050
Ganghwa Hall?

657
01:00:04,090 --> 01:00:07,920
Some say it's the revenge of those
who died in the Ganghwa Hall fire.

658
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:12,670
Then the next victim must
be connected to this place.

659
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:17,790
If the fire here was plotted
to kill innocent lives,

660
01:00:18,590 --> 01:00:22,880
he's killing those
involved to get revenge?

661
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:25,630
That ghastly fool!

662
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:32,630
He must have his reasons.

663
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:39,540
The monster must've once been a human too.

664
01:00:41,630 --> 01:00:42,630
Like me.

665
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:49,050
There's sadness in his eyes.

666
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:59,590
Didn't you lose your memory?

667
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:02,790
How do you know about Ganghwa Hall?

668
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:05,790
I'm not sure.

669
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:08,760
It just came to me.

670
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:13,250
I saw Ganghwa Hall here.

671
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:42,130
The arrowhead pointed to Ganghwa Hall?

672
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:45,920
The next victim is connected
to the fire 30 years ago.

673
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:49,630
Ask realtors and find out
why Ganghwa Hall is gone.

674
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:52,500
I'll investigate more on Ha Byung-eun.

675
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:03,470
He must be Ha Byung-eun's father.

676
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:21,220
Why hold a sacrifice instead of
wishing his son's spirit well?

677
01:02:58,630 --> 01:02:59,630
Nan?

678
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:07,760
Have you forgotten?

679
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:12,800
Did you think it was over?

680
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:19,000
You watched me die, but lived comfortably?

681
01:03:22,290 --> 01:03:25,830
Just as you murdered my wife and son,

682
01:03:26,630 --> 01:03:29,260
I'll destroy you and your family!

683
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:32,840
Forgive me!

684
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:38,590
I deserve to die!

685
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:18,920
I couldn't protect you to the end.

686
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:20,920
I'm sorry.

687
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:25,540
Son!

688
01:04:33,790 --> 01:04:35,330
- Ganghwa Hall?
- Yes.

689
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,840
I heard Ganghwa Hall
burned down 30 years ago.

690
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:41,420
What happened?

691
01:04:42,710 --> 01:04:44,340
It wasn't just a fire.

692
01:04:47,210 --> 01:04:48,210
It was treason.

693
01:04:49,090 --> 01:04:49,880
Treason?

694
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:55,460
They say that the Crown
Prince was poisoned there.

695
01:04:56,090 --> 01:05:01,630
So, the Jeong family was annihilated
and a pond was made there.

696
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:06,260
The Jeong family owned Ganghwa Hall?

697
01:05:11,590 --> 01:05:13,380
He killed your son!

698
01:05:13,420 --> 01:05:14,590
Who is he?

699
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:16,210
Jeong In-yul!

700
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:19,340
The Jeong family has been loyal
to the king for generations.

701
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:23,130
Jeong In-yul and his father
were very loyal too.

702
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:28,880
But they were executed
for plotting treason.

703
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:30,470
Jeong In-yul...

704
01:05:31,290 --> 01:05:35,170
He's back from hell!

705
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:37,170
Jeong In-yul...

706
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:51,340
A royal award?

707
01:05:51,710 --> 01:05:55,170
For those who reported the
Crown Prince's murder?

708
01:05:56,090 --> 01:05:58,340
Hong Jeong-ho, Song Gap-young, Ha Il-ju...

709
01:05:58,880 --> 01:05:59,880
Hong...

710
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:02,080
Hong Tae-mun, Song Pil-geun, Ha Byung-eun!

711
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:05,420
He killed the sons of those here in order!

712
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:07,630
There must be two more names.

713
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:09,040
Choi Il-kyu?

714
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:12,170
- The owner of Yeon-mi Lodge?
- Yes.

715
01:06:12,750 --> 01:06:16,090
The land and building
belonged to the Jeong family.

716
01:06:16,130 --> 01:06:19,470
But after they died, everything
went to Choi Il-kyu.

717
01:06:20,210 --> 01:06:23,670
Then the next target must
be his son, Jae-kyung.

718
01:06:24,090 --> 01:06:28,510
He knew his turn would come,
so he read up on monsters.

719
01:06:29,090 --> 01:06:30,090
Jeong In-yul...

720
01:06:30,590 --> 01:06:34,220
He's getting revenge on those
who reported the treason.

721
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:39,960
Today's the 12th!

722
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:41,420
What about it, sir?

723
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:43,000
Hong Tae-mun died on the 3rd.

724
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:44,290
Song died on the 6th.

725
01:06:44,340 --> 01:06:45,970
And Ha died on the 9th!

726
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:48,920
There's no time!

727
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,880
We can't fight a vampire
with our bare hands!

728
01:06:55,210 --> 01:06:57,250
Then how do we stop it, sir?

729
01:06:57,630 --> 01:07:00,090
Strike it with silver or burn it!

730
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:04,460
If you don't burn its heart,
it could be revived with blood.

731
01:07:43,420 --> 01:07:45,920
The killer will come here tonight.

732
01:07:46,710 --> 01:07:50,420
He has extraordinary skills
and won't be easy to fight.

733
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:52,210
You must shoot...

734
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:02,130
You must shoot him with fiery arrows!

735
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:03,460
Yes, sir!

736
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:28,040
Jeong In-yul!

737
01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:34,960
You and your father
poisoned the Crown Prince!

738
01:09:35,170 --> 01:09:37,800
But you want revenge?

739
01:09:38,170 --> 01:09:39,960
Rather than repent,

740
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,960
you took innocent lives!

741
01:09:42,340 --> 01:09:44,590
You will pay for your crime!

742
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:47,380
Pay for my crime?

743
01:09:48,460 --> 01:09:51,250
You'll die here too!

744
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:17,000
Pain, you say?

745
01:10:18,090 --> 01:10:20,380
What do you know about never-ending pain!

746
01:10:21,210 --> 01:10:24,840
How dare you tell me to pay for my crime!

747
01:10:30,170 --> 01:10:31,340
Put him down.

748
01:10:35,420 --> 01:10:37,750
Though you seek blood now,

749
01:10:38,130 --> 01:10:40,630
were you not once a man of honor?

750
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:46,800
Since your memory isn't back,

751
01:10:47,790 --> 01:10:50,330
you must not know how you died.

752
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:54,750
Why?

753
01:10:55,630 --> 01:10:57,880
Think your death was different from mine?

754
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:01,670
When you remember how you
died and who killed you,

755
01:11:02,210 --> 01:11:05,670
you'll become just like me.

756
01:11:05,710 --> 01:11:06,710
No.

757
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:09,050
I won't be a monster like you.

758
01:11:09,670 --> 01:11:10,960
Drink blood.

759
01:11:12,170 --> 01:11:14,840
Find your painful memories

760
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:18,670
and get revenge on the
day of the full moon!

761
01:12:03,590 --> 01:12:05,090
You must live!

762
01:12:28,070 --> 01:12:31,320
You want to turn me into a real vampire?

763
01:12:34,190 --> 01:12:36,480
Why did you try to give me blood?

764
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:40,690
I wanted to save you.

765
01:12:43,570 --> 01:12:44,570
Why?

766
01:12:49,150 --> 01:12:51,400
What if I bite you?

767
01:12:52,150 --> 01:12:53,690
You'll become a vampire too.

768
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:57,110
Do you wish to live on innocent blood?

769
01:12:58,610 --> 01:13:02,900
Even so, I would never drink
someone else's blood.

770
01:13:08,570 --> 01:13:12,280
Then I'll bite Seo-pil for you,
so you won't be lonely.

771
01:13:24,610 --> 01:13:27,610
Being with the crazy girl,
you've lost your mind, sir.

772
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:07,360
Yes, ma'am.

773
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:20,490
<i>SIR HA IL-JU AND CHOI IL-KYU DIED</i>

774
01:14:22,070 --> 01:14:26,780
<i>No warnings this time?
There must be another target.</i>

775
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:32,070
Seo-pil? Wake up.

776
01:14:32,110 --> 01:14:34,030
Let me hold your hand.

777
01:14:34,490 --> 01:14:36,370
I said wake up!

778
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:06,940
<i>I'll bite Seo-pil for you.</i>

779
01:15:20,690 --> 01:15:22,860
Get dressed, already!

780
01:15:22,900 --> 01:15:24,240
Yes, sir.

781
01:15:24,860 --> 01:15:27,190
Someone will die in 3 days.

782
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:29,570
We must find the last informer before then.

783
01:15:43,030 --> 01:15:46,070
Choi Il-kyu must have the royal award too.

784
01:15:46,860 --> 01:15:50,280
Why hide a proud certificate?

785
01:15:51,740 --> 01:15:53,870
Was he ashamed of it?

786
01:16:03,570 --> 01:16:05,320
The full moon is in 3 days.

787
01:16:05,780 --> 01:16:08,030
It's when the spirits'
powers are the strongest!

788
01:16:08,070 --> 01:16:09,070
Wait!

789
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:11,610
The Full Moon Fest...

790
01:16:12,530 --> 01:16:14,070
His Majesty will be here!

791
01:16:14,110 --> 01:16:15,110
Sir?

792
01:16:15,570 --> 01:16:16,950
Please run away.

793
01:16:18,030 --> 01:16:19,990
I can't protect you any longer!

794
01:16:34,820 --> 01:16:36,650
What do you fools want?

795
01:16:36,690 --> 01:16:37,690
Sir!

796
01:16:38,530 --> 01:16:41,450
Stay back. I'll handle them.

797
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:43,400
But...

798
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:47,490
I'm immortal now, sir.

799
01:16:48,150 --> 01:16:49,570
My body is on fire.

800
01:16:49,940 --> 01:16:52,070
I can't control my new powers!

801
01:16:52,530 --> 01:16:54,910
- Seo-pil! Actually...
- Listen!

802
01:16:54,940 --> 01:16:58,440
I'll have mercy and give you time to run.

803
01:16:58,490 --> 01:17:02,490
Or else today will be
your last day as humans!

804
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:08,030
Foolish thugs!

805
01:17:09,070 --> 01:17:13,400
I'll feast off your blood!

806
01:17:13,860 --> 01:17:16,150
I drew the bite marks on you!

807
01:17:28,940 --> 01:17:30,770
You have what I want.

808
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:34,400
If you give it to me, I'll go quietly.

809
01:17:39,610 --> 01:17:41,610
This will help you decide.

810
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:46,900
Stop!

811
01:18:11,530 --> 01:18:16,320
When I awoke in the mountain,
a monk gave it to me.

812
01:18:17,990 --> 01:18:19,910
The case 30 years ago...

813
01:18:20,650 --> 01:18:23,780
Maybe the perpetrators and
victims should be switched.

814
01:18:24,610 --> 01:18:27,570
Those thugs are trying to hide something!

815
01:18:27,990 --> 01:18:31,490
What did they want? What was inside?

816
01:18:33,860 --> 01:18:38,490
It was a scroll with strange secret codes.

817
01:18:38,530 --> 01:18:39,530
Secret codes?

818
01:18:41,150 --> 01:18:43,990
My clever brain would've solved it!

819
01:18:44,030 --> 01:18:45,320
What a pity.

820
01:18:46,190 --> 01:18:47,190
Dang!

821
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:49,280
- Why you little!
- What?

822
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:50,490
I remember!

823
01:19:01,150 --> 01:19:04,360
Secret codes are written
with certain patterns.

824
01:19:04,650 --> 01:19:07,280
If you find the pattern, it can be read.

825
01:19:19,860 --> 01:19:22,400
Where's that clever brain of yours?

826
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:23,610
Huh, sir?

827
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:53,400
I knew it!

828
01:19:54,190 --> 01:19:55,190
I was wrong.

829
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:58,490
Could you write up another one?

830
01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:03,900
Right here! Just bite him!

831
01:20:18,030 --> 01:20:19,280
Get back, sir.

832
01:20:21,690 --> 01:20:23,270
You're confusing me!

833
01:20:34,110 --> 01:20:35,110
Wait!

834
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:37,320
They used Korean alphabet!

835
01:20:41,110 --> 01:20:45,530
The 1st and 3rd lines are consonants
written with vertical symmetry.

836
01:20:45,570 --> 01:20:49,360
The middle line has vowels
drawn with triangles.

837
01:20:49,860 --> 01:20:53,320
The circles mean 'A'.
The triangles mean 'O' or 'U'.

838
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:57,110
Circles with lines mean 'E' and so on.

839
01:21:03,030 --> 01:21:07,280
<i>POISON THE CROWN PRINCE AND FRAME
JEONG IN-YUL AND HIS FATHER</i>

840
01:21:07,990 --> 01:21:08,990
I knew it!

841
01:21:10,780 --> 01:21:13,990
Those who reported the treason
were the real traitors!

842
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:15,440
What do you mean?

843
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:18,280
It's a conspiracy pact.

844
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:21,030
The Crown Prince's death was fabricated!

845
01:21:21,530 --> 01:21:23,320
Those who poisoned him

846
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:27,400
framed it on Jeong In-yul
and his father as treason!

847
01:21:29,940 --> 01:21:33,110
So, Jeong In-yul is
getting revenge on them?

848
01:21:33,570 --> 01:21:35,820
What do you know about never-ending pain!

849
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:38,450
I don't know how he became a vampire.

850
01:21:38,780 --> 01:21:40,740
But by killing the traitors' sons,

851
01:21:41,070 --> 01:21:44,030
he wanted them to suffer
more pain than death.

852
01:21:44,860 --> 01:21:47,280
He'll kill the last traitor's son next!

853
01:21:49,110 --> 01:21:50,530
Song Gap-young.

854
01:21:50,860 --> 01:21:52,530
Ha Il-ju.

855
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:54,320
Choi Il-kyu.

856
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:55,740
And

857
01:21:55,780 --> 01:21:57,030
Kim...

858
01:21:59,610 --> 01:22:01,190
And who, sir?

859
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:04,530
Kim Shin?

860
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:06,820
Kim Shin?

861
01:22:07,690 --> 01:22:09,610
Your father, sir?

862
01:22:11,740 --> 01:22:13,740
Jeong In-yul knew me.

863
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:17,740
How dare you tell me to pay for my crime!

864
01:22:18,190 --> 01:22:20,570
He knows I'm the last informer's son.

865
01:22:23,490 --> 01:22:24,660
Kim Shin?

866
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:43,620
What brings you here, Min?

867
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:28,440
Give me blood.

868
01:23:30,530 --> 01:23:31,530
I want...

869
01:23:33,940 --> 01:23:34,940
blood.

870
01:23:58,860 --> 01:24:00,990
The subjects are watching.

871
01:24:01,570 --> 01:24:02,570
Let them.

872
01:24:03,990 --> 01:24:07,280
I should hold my beloved's
hand on a night like this.

873
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:10,070
Mother!

874
01:24:10,110 --> 01:24:11,690
Father!

875
01:24:12,990 --> 01:24:14,030
Prince!

876
01:24:14,530 --> 01:24:16,870
Our son must've had a bad dream.

877
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:27,490
What happened 30 years ago?

878
01:24:30,780 --> 01:24:34,700
Jeong In-yul is the one who called me here.

879
01:24:34,940 --> 01:24:37,270
Jeong In-yul died!

880
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:40,570
I saw it with my own eyes!

881
01:24:41,030 --> 01:24:44,950
If you don't tell me,
I'll hear it from him.

882
01:24:45,490 --> 01:24:46,820
I did it for you!

883
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:50,860
Did you make a wish?

884
01:24:53,740 --> 01:24:54,740
Yes, sir.

885
01:24:55,030 --> 01:24:57,530
I wished for His Majesty's

886
01:24:57,570 --> 01:24:59,990
<i>JEONG IN-YUL</i>
quick recovery, Your Highness.

887
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:07,560
You make me an unfilial son.

888
01:25:07,590 --> 01:25:10,010
How is that so, Your Highness?

889
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:15,180
The world knows you tend to
His Majesty every night.

890
01:25:15,220 --> 01:25:18,010
I just did what a subject should.

891
01:25:19,470 --> 01:25:20,470
I was kidding.

892
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:25,010
Your Highness?

893
01:25:25,590 --> 01:25:27,220
What did you wish for?

894
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:31,060
I wished for Joseon

895
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:34,680
to be returned to its owner.

896
01:25:36,090 --> 01:25:38,760
Joseon belongs to His Majesty and you, sir.

897
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:43,010
A king should not be the
owner of a country.

898
01:25:44,090 --> 01:25:47,170
The people should be.

899
01:25:49,050 --> 01:25:51,390
Joseon doesn't belong to the people now.

900
01:25:53,010 --> 01:25:56,010
Those who must work for
the people rule them.

901
01:25:56,430 --> 01:25:59,180
They make factions and fight
to keep what's theirs.

902
01:25:59,470 --> 01:26:02,350
They try to control the
king and alienate others.

903
01:26:03,050 --> 01:26:05,430
They frame their opposers as traitors.

904
01:26:07,890 --> 01:26:09,770
They're the ones who own Joseon.

905
01:26:13,300 --> 01:26:14,680
When I become king,

906
01:26:16,090 --> 01:26:19,840
I'll take Joseon away from them
and give it back to the people.

907
01:26:22,090 --> 01:26:23,970
I trust you will, sir.

908
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:28,550
See the lanterns?

909
01:26:29,090 --> 01:26:32,550
Do you know what the people wished for?

910
01:26:34,340 --> 01:26:36,670
The people make small cries.

911
01:26:37,140 --> 01:26:39,720
It's their leaders who raise their voices.

912
01:26:45,140 --> 01:26:49,020
Joseon doesn't need people
to talk for the civilians.

913
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:53,220
We need people to listen
to their small cries.

914
01:26:54,050 --> 01:27:01,680
I want to make it so that civilians
will not suffer from hunger and pain.

915
01:27:05,590 --> 01:27:08,590
Did you find anything?

916
01:27:12,180 --> 01:27:15,390
It's been long since I
sent you to Ganghwa Hall.

917
01:27:16,140 --> 01:27:18,060
Promise me first, sir.

918
01:27:18,090 --> 01:27:19,670
You found a way?

919
01:27:20,430 --> 01:27:21,430
Tell me.

920
01:27:23,220 --> 01:27:24,640
Why are you hesitating?

921
01:27:25,180 --> 01:27:29,890
Do you wish to see your
entire family be annihilated?

922
01:27:39,970 --> 01:27:40,850
What is it?

923
01:27:40,890 --> 01:27:42,810
The Crown Prince has passed away!

924
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:43,840
What?

925
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:46,260
But how?

926
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:49,300
Sir! Sir!

927
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:52,090
Please run away! Your
father's been arrested!

928
01:27:52,140 --> 01:27:53,140
My father? Why?

929
01:27:53,180 --> 01:27:55,640
That he poisoned His Highness...

930
01:27:55,680 --> 01:27:56,970
That's preposterous!

931
01:28:02,430 --> 01:28:04,520
Your Highness! You must leave at once.

932
01:28:04,970 --> 01:28:06,260
What do you mean?

933
01:28:07,010 --> 01:28:08,090
Where is His Highness?

934
01:28:11,430 --> 01:28:13,930
The young prince is in danger.
Please change.

935
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:21,300
Let's go.

936
01:28:23,590 --> 01:28:24,590
Where are you going?

937
01:28:24,640 --> 01:28:28,060
You know very well that my
father would never do this.

938
01:28:28,090 --> 01:28:29,170
He's been framed!

939
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:33,100
Those who killed His Highness
will be after the prince.

940
01:28:46,220 --> 01:28:47,220
Your Highness!

941
01:28:47,260 --> 01:28:48,680
Please follow me.

942
01:30:07,090 --> 01:30:08,090
Your Highness?

943
01:30:08,140 --> 01:30:09,180
Please sit here.

944
01:30:13,720 --> 01:30:15,760
They won't come here.

945
01:30:18,550 --> 01:30:19,550
Thank you.

946
01:30:21,470 --> 01:30:23,720
How could you come in here?

947
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:25,510
Haven't you heard about this ship?

948
01:30:25,550 --> 01:30:26,840
It's a revolt.

949
01:30:27,090 --> 01:30:30,550
We must protect the prince
until things settle down.

950
01:30:37,050 --> 01:30:37,930
In-yul!

951
01:30:38,010 --> 01:30:39,010
Run away!

952
01:30:40,260 --> 01:30:43,550
Protect them no matter what!

953
01:30:47,640 --> 01:30:48,640
Hurry!

954
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:56,060
But it's treason, sir! I can't do it.

955
01:30:56,090 --> 01:30:57,090
You fool!

956
01:30:58,430 --> 01:30:59,890
It's not treason.

957
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:04,340
The Crown Prince becoming king is treason!

958
01:31:05,930 --> 01:31:10,520
He's filled with absurd ideals!
If he becomes king, Joseon will fall!

959
01:31:11,470 --> 01:31:14,720
<i>A country does not thrive on ideals alone!</i>

960
01:31:15,510 --> 01:31:22,050
<i>The only way to save your family
is to bring down the Crown Prince!</i>

961
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:34,930
What are you doing?

962
01:31:40,430 --> 01:31:41,430
Please...

963
01:31:42,260 --> 01:31:44,050
Please let the prince live?

964
01:31:57,390 --> 01:31:58,520
Open the door.

965
01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:00,420
Open it now!

966
01:32:01,340 --> 01:32:04,670
Just let the prince live!

967
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:07,510
Please save the prince!

968
01:32:08,220 --> 01:32:09,220
No!

969
01:32:14,010 --> 01:32:17,840
It would've been better to
die than to beg for life.

970
01:32:18,970 --> 01:32:19,970
You fool!

971
01:32:20,300 --> 01:32:24,930
If I didn't do that, our family
would've been annihilated!

972
01:32:25,470 --> 01:32:28,970
I abandoned my friend and the Crown Prince

973
01:32:29,470 --> 01:32:31,010
to save you!

974
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:37,640
You mean, this is all because of me?

975
01:32:38,430 --> 01:32:40,680
You did all that for me?

976
01:32:41,010 --> 01:32:43,890
Then what makes me different
from the monster?

977
01:32:44,510 --> 01:32:48,640
I lived well in a family that
thrived on innocent blood!

978
01:32:48,680 --> 01:32:50,720
Then I'm a monster too!

979
01:33:08,510 --> 01:33:09,640
Scour the area!

980
01:33:10,720 --> 01:33:11,760
Yes, sir!

981
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:22,840
Prince...

982
01:33:24,510 --> 01:33:25,840
You must survive.

983
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:28,770
Search there!

984
01:33:52,640 --> 01:33:53,720
Find them!

985
01:34:06,390 --> 01:34:07,680
Don't let them get away!

986
01:34:16,140 --> 01:34:17,810
Corner her and catch her!

987
01:34:39,100 --> 01:34:40,350
Mother?

988
01:34:40,390 --> 01:34:45,720
If snow falls before the balsam fades,

989
01:34:45,770 --> 01:34:50,150
I heard you can meet the one you miss.

990
01:34:50,730 --> 01:34:51,860
Prince?

991
01:34:52,310 --> 01:34:54,890
Where did you hear that?

992
01:34:54,940 --> 01:35:01,650
It doesn't matter for
me if the balsam fades.

993
01:35:02,100 --> 01:35:03,100
Why?

994
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:06,390
Even if you can't meet the one you miss?

995
01:35:06,520 --> 01:35:11,270
I'll live with you and Father forever.

996
01:35:11,310 --> 01:35:14,390
I won't miss anyone.

997
01:35:37,190 --> 01:35:39,020
You were Sun...

998
01:35:43,980 --> 01:35:46,110
My son, Sun...

999
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:54,390
I didn't even hold your hand.

1000
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:59,070
You died...

1001
01:36:02,730 --> 01:36:05,730
before even calling me mother.

1002
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:11,980
I'm sorry.

1003
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:17,230
I'm so sorry.

1004
01:36:31,810 --> 01:36:32,810
Your Highness!

1005
01:36:33,310 --> 01:36:34,350
I, Jeong In-yul,

1006
01:36:34,810 --> 01:36:38,060
was disloyal in being
deceived by a greedy friend.

1007
01:36:38,890 --> 01:36:42,430
I will punish him for harming
the Crown Prince and prince.

1008
01:36:45,640 --> 01:36:50,720
I'll burn everything he
owns once and for all!

1009
01:36:51,850 --> 01:36:54,940
He will come tomorrow
during the Full Moon Fest.

1010
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:57,270
That puts His Majesty in harms way!

1011
01:36:57,640 --> 01:36:59,350
We must reveal everything.

1012
01:37:00,100 --> 01:37:01,520
Even if I must die,

1013
01:37:02,060 --> 01:37:04,770
I'll reveal your crimes, Father!

1014
01:37:10,730 --> 01:37:13,110
Lock him away at once!

1015
01:38:02,350 --> 01:38:03,350
Sir!

1016
01:38:04,640 --> 01:38:05,680
Stay back!

1017
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:11,440
<i>I'm their owner's son.
They'll never harm me.</i>

1018
01:38:13,980 --> 01:38:15,820
Stay back or else!

1019
01:38:16,060 --> 01:38:17,100
This sir...

1020
01:38:17,140 --> 01:38:19,350
This fool is dead!

1021
01:38:19,850 --> 01:38:21,560
I said stay back!

1022
01:38:24,890 --> 01:38:26,020
My toe!

1023
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:28,310
- Are you all right?
- I have gout!

1024
01:39:02,690 --> 01:39:03,690
Giddy up!

1025
01:39:03,940 --> 01:39:04,940
Giddy up!

1026
01:39:06,270 --> 01:39:07,270
Giddy up!

1027
01:39:36,640 --> 01:39:37,640
Giddy up!

1028
01:39:39,770 --> 01:39:41,060
What are you doing?

1029
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:43,060
I'll protect you! Grab the reins!

1030
01:39:43,640 --> 01:39:45,060
Seo-pil!

1031
01:39:54,600 --> 01:39:59,690
My gout!

1032
01:41:58,060 --> 01:41:59,140
Were you scared?

1033
01:42:01,560 --> 01:42:05,810
Scared people will disdain
you if they own Joseon?

1034
01:42:09,100 --> 01:42:11,310
Scared you'll lose everything?

1035
01:42:14,980 --> 01:42:20,400
Scared my young son will
live and reveal your sins?

1036
01:42:50,190 --> 01:42:51,650
I've been waiting.

1037
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:55,980
I could strike you in the heart.

1038
01:42:58,020 --> 01:43:00,810
Please don't hesitate, Wol-young.

1039
01:43:02,890 --> 01:43:07,560
You must be so angry to
have to come back like this.

1040
01:43:08,940 --> 01:43:10,190
I must die

1041
01:43:10,810 --> 01:43:14,310
so your anger can be
resolved in the least bit.

1042
01:43:15,730 --> 01:43:21,230
I hope this will pay for
some of my father's sins.

1043
01:43:21,980 --> 01:43:24,570
Your father did not
only take away my life,

1044
01:43:26,190 --> 01:43:28,070
but my son and husband too.

1045
01:43:29,190 --> 01:43:34,020
We just wanted to be together.

1046
01:43:36,230 --> 01:43:37,940
That's all we wanted.

1047
01:43:39,480 --> 01:43:40,480
But

1048
01:43:41,270 --> 01:43:45,060
you enjoyed the last 30 years
upon their unjust deaths.

1049
01:43:46,060 --> 01:43:47,690
You ask me to kill you?

1050
01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:51,600
Fine.

1051
01:43:53,560 --> 01:43:55,440
I'll kill you again and again!

1052
01:44:10,520 --> 01:44:12,600
<i>I want to know who I am.</i>

1053
01:44:13,270 --> 01:44:17,730
<i>Perhaps you lived in the distant past.</i>

1054
01:44:18,060 --> 01:44:19,520
Maybe 100 years ago?

1055
01:44:20,100 --> 01:44:21,190
That long?

1056
01:44:22,270 --> 01:44:23,600
Then I'd be so old.

1057
01:44:23,810 --> 01:44:25,690
Shall I call you granny?

1058
01:44:25,730 --> 01:44:28,440
No! I'd rather be called a monster.

1059
01:45:54,940 --> 01:45:56,690
It was exactly 30 years ago.

1060
01:45:57,350 --> 01:45:59,890
Trying to save you, I became a monster.

1061
01:46:00,730 --> 01:46:01,730
But you!

1062
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:06,060
To fill your filthy mouth,
you killed the Crown Prince!

1063
01:46:06,640 --> 01:46:08,430
And my father and I!

1064
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:13,480
Jeong In-yul!

1065
01:46:20,640 --> 01:46:23,680
I know the truth to your unjust suffering!

1066
01:46:24,140 --> 01:46:27,640
I'll reveal everything, so stop this!

1067
01:46:28,810 --> 01:46:29,850
The truth?

1068
01:46:30,890 --> 01:46:31,810
That's right!

1069
01:46:31,850 --> 01:46:32,850
Tonight!

1070
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:39,070
The truth will burn you alive!

1071
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:02,520
No!

1072
01:47:13,640 --> 01:47:15,770
Die you evil monster!

1073
01:47:21,230 --> 01:47:23,150
You call me a monster?

1074
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:28,020
After knowing what your father did to me?

1075
01:47:28,310 --> 01:47:31,520
How dare you call me a monster?

1076
01:47:31,940 --> 01:47:33,270
30 years ago,

1077
01:47:34,810 --> 01:47:37,810
you became a monster to save a friend.

1078
01:47:38,940 --> 01:47:39,980
But now!

1079
01:47:40,690 --> 01:47:44,610
You kill innocent people for revenge!

1080
01:47:44,980 --> 01:47:47,110
And threaten His Majesty's life!

1081
01:47:48,100 --> 01:47:50,390
You're just a monster!

1082
01:48:04,890 --> 01:48:06,020
Now, die!

1083
01:48:17,190 --> 01:48:18,270
Your Highness!

1084
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:21,020
You've done enough.

1085
01:48:21,270 --> 01:48:22,400
No, Your Highness!

1086
01:48:22,980 --> 01:48:25,650
He must die to finish my revenge.

1087
01:48:30,190 --> 01:48:33,150
Those who made us into
monsters are all dead.

1088
01:48:34,810 --> 01:48:35,940
Stop.

1089
01:48:38,730 --> 01:48:40,070
It's over now.

1090
01:48:44,600 --> 01:48:49,190
I don't know how to stop.

1091
01:48:51,060 --> 01:48:53,060
My father is still alive in my heart.

1092
01:48:54,230 --> 01:48:59,650
His Highness and the prince
must be alive in you too!

1093
01:48:59,890 --> 01:49:03,600
I can't stop here.

1094
01:49:29,390 --> 01:49:31,520
You know very well

1095
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:36,060
that we should not have come back to life.

1096
01:49:38,350 --> 01:49:41,440
We're just monsters who crave human blood.

1097
01:49:44,310 --> 01:49:47,690
Though we've gotten our revenge,

1098
01:49:50,230 --> 01:49:53,440
we can only live on the
blood of innocent people.

1099
01:49:56,520 --> 01:49:58,230
We've done enough.

1100
01:49:59,730 --> 01:50:01,400
It's time to go.

1101
01:50:12,850 --> 01:50:14,310
I, Jeong In-yul,

1102
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:17,600
shall go to the Crown Prince first.

1103
01:50:20,810 --> 01:50:23,020
Forgive me, Your Highness.

1104
01:51:08,390 --> 01:51:09,270
Your Highness!

1105
01:51:09,310 --> 01:51:10,480
Please go inside!

1106
01:51:34,350 --> 01:51:36,350
What is time?

1107
01:51:36,390 --> 01:51:38,890
Please hide from the sunlight!

1108
01:51:41,980 --> 01:51:47,070
Waiting is only possible in time.

1109
01:51:57,480 --> 01:52:00,230
But the balsam stain remains...

1110
01:52:03,940 --> 01:52:06,770
Will I meet the ones I miss?

1111
01:53:12,690 --> 01:53:14,570
I missed you so much.

1112
01:53:47,850 --> 01:53:49,140
30 years ago,

1113
01:53:49,480 --> 01:53:54,360
Kim Shin poisoned the Crown Prince
and framed the Jeong family.

1114
01:53:54,850 --> 01:53:57,940
Thus, seize all his assets and servants.

1115
01:53:58,270 --> 01:54:02,400
Although his son revealed everything,

1116
01:54:02,690 --> 01:54:09,020
Kim Min must also be
beheaded to uphold the law!

1117
01:54:18,940 --> 01:54:21,320
<i>A MONTH LATER</i>

1118
01:54:32,810 --> 01:54:35,640
I heard you've gone a little cuckoo.

1119
01:54:35,980 --> 01:54:37,270
Maybe a lot.

1120
01:54:39,600 --> 01:54:45,560
He's coming! He's coming for me!

1121
01:54:45,600 --> 01:54:48,440
Who? Who's coming for you?

1122
01:54:49,480 --> 01:54:51,020
He came in my dreams.

1123
01:54:51,890 --> 01:54:54,270
He said he's coming for me!

1124
01:54:55,270 --> 01:54:58,060
So weak for a young fellow.

1125
01:55:07,020 --> 01:55:08,770
If you're a man, state your name!

1126
01:55:08,810 --> 01:55:10,770
If you're a ghost, go away!

1127
01:55:19,190 --> 01:55:20,190
It's me!

1128
01:55:30,940 --> 01:55:32,820
I waited so long.

1129
01:55:42,270 --> 01:55:43,270
Your Majesty!

1130
01:55:46,100 --> 01:55:47,560
You're already dead.

1131
01:55:49,640 --> 01:55:52,810
Kim Min no longer exists in Joseon.

1132
01:55:55,100 --> 01:56:01,310
There are many things you
must do for me in secret.

1133
01:56:03,890 --> 01:56:06,850
What did His Majesty command?

1134
01:56:07,270 --> 01:56:08,980
A month ago, in Andong,

1135
01:56:09,270 --> 01:56:13,190
the dead started to come
back to life and eat people.

1136
01:56:13,600 --> 01:56:14,690
Man-eating dead?

1137
01:56:14,730 --> 01:56:15,730
Yes!

1138
01:56:15,850 --> 01:56:18,190
They exist but do not.

1139
01:56:18,390 --> 01:56:22,350
They are called zombies.

1140
01:56:22,730 --> 01:56:23,730
Oh really?

1141
01:56:24,560 --> 01:56:25,560
Good luck!

1142
01:56:25,690 --> 01:56:27,940
Wait! Come with me!

1143
01:56:37,100 --> 01:56:41,850
