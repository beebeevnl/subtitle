00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:36,830
your sins are no different
from those of vampires.

103
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,960

Vampires exist.

109
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,580

113
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:42,910
Such a pity that you think
the world is so puny.

114
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:47,210
In 1742, a report was made

115
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:50,540
about Scholar Choi and his servant.

116
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:54,080
The servant saw a mysterious light.

117
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,040
Then Choi vanished without a trace.

118
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,490

unbelievable incidents.

120
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,370
Who's to say vampires don't exist?

121
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,000
Do you have proof?

122
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,700
30 years ago,

123
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,160
a Westerners' ship headed for
China ran aground in Joseon.

124
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:28,200
There are records of
vampire sightings then.

125
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,320
Come on, sir.

126
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,160
Cut the nonsense and do
your detective work.

127
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,240
Aren't you paying me rent?

128
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:39,250
Stop roaming and go back
to your nice house.

129
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:41,120
Then I'll have to get married!

130
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,080
If you must, why not?

131
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:54,500
I don't wish to marry without love.

132
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,910
Then tell your father that.

133
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,500
- He decided who I'll marry.
- So what?

134
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:04,710
You're good at speaking your mind.
Can't you talk to your father?

135
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,240
It's your life, sir!

136
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,370
Just say no!

137
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:12,990
Say you're not marrying a
stranger without love.

138
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,080
I did!

139
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,160
I told him it's my life and
he can't decide for me.

140
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,700
And?

141
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:20,870
I got slapped.

142
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:24,960
He's firm.

143
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,870
I thought the Premier would be different.

144
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,080

Anticipation for the Full Moon Fest

146
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,910
is high throughout Joseon.

147
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:40,700
People of all ages are working hard

148
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:49,490
to prepare a greater fest than
the one 30 years ago, sir.

149
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:59,420
Recently, 10,000 people worked
on fortifying our forts.

150
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:05,750
It must be hard for them to work
for the Full Moon Fest too.

151
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:11,830
Thus, I shall grant a small reward
to the workers.

152
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:16,080
Set rice as the only tributary.

153
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:21,030
And have aristocrats pay
for the military cloth as well.

154
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:30,290
I, Premier Kim Shin, request
to speak, Your Majesty.

155
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:36,580
His Majesty's mercy and heart
for the people is like heaven.

156
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,870
However,

157
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:42,160
if aristocrats pay the same as peasants,

158
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,990
what makes them different, sir?

159
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:48,570
It'll destroy class distinction

160
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:51,750
and shake the basis of Joseon, sir.

161
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:54,920
Please, Your Majesty!

162
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:58,920
Please retract your command, sir!

163
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,040
Even the king can't have his way with him.

164
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,330
Any functional problems in getting married?

165
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:10,580
Why you little!

166
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,500
Excuse me.

167
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:40,410
Who?

168
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,790
It's scorched rice tea.

169
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:52,960
Thank you.

170
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:55,530
It has a rich, deep flavor.

171
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,450
I did a great job making it.

172
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,580
Let me introduce myself.

173
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,450
I'm the daughter of the
owner of Yeon-mi Lodge.

174
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,740
How could we be of help?

175
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:14,120
Recently, while repairing
building in Ganghwa,

176
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,160
the roof suddenly caved
in and many workers died.

177
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:23,790
While burying the dead,
two corpses were discovered.

178
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:28,540
One was a skeleton and
the other was burned.

179
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,210
However, the burnt one
wasn't decayed at all.

180
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,370
But that's not all!

181
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,240
While they went to report it,

182
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:39,290
The corpse disappeared!

183
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,240
Only the burnt corpse vanished!

184
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:45,210
Then another incident happened soon after.

185
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,750
It was quite peculiar.

186
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:52,250
Some say a man burned
to death by an invisible fire.

187
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:54,830
He died but was not dead.

188
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,500
He lived but did not live!

189
00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:00,910
Some say it's the revenge of those
who died in the Ganghwa Hall fire.

190
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,370
The Full Moon Fest is taking
place after 30 years.

191
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:09,660
My father has been ordered
by the court to prepare it.

192
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,660
However, he is ill and can't
see to such problems.

193
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:19,080
I've come to ask you to
solve the mysteries for us.

194
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,660
It won't be easy.

195
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,910
Serial killings can't be ruled out.

196
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:28,040
I heard you are the best
in all of Joseon, sir.

197
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,450
I'm not the best.

198
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:37,240
I'm the best of the best!

199
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,660
It's sad that I can only
explain myself that way.

200
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,790
He's a little arrogant.

201
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:43,990
I see.

202
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,080
Let's talk accommodations.

203
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,700
Will it have two rooms
or one with living room?

204
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,410
One with living room, sir.

205
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:52,580
Inside bathroom or outside?

206
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,540
Inside, sir.

207
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,500
And breakfast?

208
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,750
Provided, sir.

209
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,040

The guest door is that way.

218
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,750
The owner's daughter asked me to come.

219
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:47,960
I'm a detective.

220
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:50,820
It's about the mysterious deaths here.

221
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,240
Your sister asked us to
come and investigate.

222
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:56,750
I don't know why she did that.

223
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,990
I don't know of such things.

225
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,160
He's a very famous detective, sir.

226
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,330
He solved the fake silver case and
even had dinner with the king.

227
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,210
I don't think he knows.

228
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,410
What if I explain it like this?

229
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,250
He got drunk before His Majesty and said,

230
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,660
'This isn't your country, pal!'

231
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,830
After the rude fiasco,
he was sent into exile.

232
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,330
That's him.

233
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:44,370
He's Premier Kim Shin's...

Or is it horse dung?

240
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,540
What is this, a barn?

241
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:07,790
It's not what she promised.

00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:12,250

almost peed on the way!

00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:27,450
Shouldn't they give us fried eggs at least?

This is why you don't make
deals with a middleman.

A man died by the same fire last night.

What is the Full Moon Fest that
the magistrate can't investigate?

262
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:20,620
In the past, royal officials
would all gather to celebrate.

His Majesty will be coming this time.

264

by looking at the corpse,

00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:29,330

- It's mine.

Don't tamper with the crime scene!

Do you know what's the most painful death?

293
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,460
Burning to death.

294
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:51,540
But the way he died shows no
sign of squirming in pain.

295
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:56,710
It means that he couldn't
move before he was burned.

00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:02,170
- An invisible fire...
- And...

Stay out, servant.

320
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:53,210
The Buddhist monk on the poster?

321
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,490
Did anyone come for his body?

322
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,580
You're the first to come for him.

323
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:02,330
So, all you know is that
he's a Buddhist monk?

324
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:04,790
Why do you ask that?

325
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:06,080
Very well then.

326
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,160
Wait! Show me your identity tag!

327
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,120
Who are you, sir?

328
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,160
Didn't Sir Choi Jae-kyung mention us?

329
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,660
You're the detective from the capital?

330
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,410
Yes.

331

There's no case I can't solve.

332
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:29,830
- I'm the best detective in...
- Excuse me, sir.

333
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:33,960
Where did she go?

334
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:38,830
I wish to see Song Pil-geun's corpse.

335
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,330
That's impossible, sir.

336
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:43,160
The magistrate gave orders
never to show it to anyone.

337
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,450
Of course not! If the magistrate said so.

338
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:52,710
On second thought, maybe
he didn't say never.

339
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:55,070
There is no such thing as never.

340
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:59,910
- You could sneak a peek at night.
- Good.

341
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,460
- I'll come back at night.
- Yes, sir.

342
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:07,830
What did you draw, sir?

343
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:13,250
Isn't she the woman from before?

344
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:15,490
That lady...

345
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,700
Did you notice?

346
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,120
Well,

347
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,910
she was a bit odd and very strong.

348
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:22,990
She's gorgeous.

349
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,040
Not again.

350
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:28,030
Why draw a pretty woman
at a time like this?

351
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,000
I need it to investigate.

352
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,210
Investigate what?

353
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,080
If you want to meet her, just say it.

354
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,620
She's there wherever we go!

355
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:40,370
That means she's connected
to this case somehow.

356
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:44,750
- Then...
- Maybe...

357
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:48,370
She could be chasing us.

358
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,490
Us? Why, sir?

359
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,410
Sir! It's me!

360
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:58,240
You must find out who she is
and why she's after this case.

361
00:31:58,290 --> 00:31:59,750
Yes, sir.

362
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:04,500
This rough chap looks suspicious.

363
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:07,000
It's a woman.

364
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:08,660
And she's pretty.

365
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:15,160
Are you going blind in your old age?

366
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:17,790
Forget it.

367
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:20,420
I'll find her. You can go back home.

368
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:21,450
No, sir!

369
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:25,030
I'll find this fool! I mean this woman!

370
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,830
Look.

371
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:35,450
There is soot in his nose.

372
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:37,740
He was burned when he was alive.

373
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:12,740
It appears we're here for the same purpose.

374
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:19,950
Would you like to take a look?

375
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:23,280
Or shall we fight and bring in the guards?

376
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:41,200
An invisible fire...

377
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:47,580
It seems he was fatally
wounded before burning.

378
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:50,450
Then the scar must be somewhere.

379
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:02,620
<i>While burying the dead,
two corpses were discovered.</i>

380
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:05,290
<i>The burnt one wasn't decayed at all.</i>

381
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,780
<i>Only the burnt corpse vanished!</i>

382
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:41,200
<i>Is it a real vampire?</i>

383
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:44,620
<i>The arrow precisely struck the heart.</i>

384
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:49,040
<i>He didn't just want the
blood, but to kill him.</i>

385
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:51,790
<i>'Yeom' means to stain.</i>

386
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:55,330
<i>Why did the killer leave a sign?</i>

387
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,490
<i>Perhaps a forewarned murder?</i>

388
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:02,660
This letter has something
to do with staining or dyes.

389
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:06,790
Go to the painting plant and
meet the painters for clues.

390
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,620
I'll search the dye house here.

391
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:17,200
<i>HA BYUNG-EUN</i>

392
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,040
Why are you here?

393
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:53,250
How long will you follow me?

394
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:57,460
I saw someone on fire too.

395
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,080
Where?

396
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,580
I'm not sure.

397
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:08,710
I'm not sure where, who,
or why I remember that.

398
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:14,420
He must've been killed by something
that looks human but is not.

399
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,580
Something that looks human but is not?

400
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:23,540
Are they really strong and fast?

401
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:25,920
And heal fast if they're hurt?

402
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:28,040
You know about vampires?

403
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,450
Vampires?

404
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:34,500
Vampires are immortal.

405
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:39,620
They don't get hurt or die.

406
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:42,080
Immortal?

407
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:40,200
I have a question.

408
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,950
You're definitely in my memory.

409
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:46,160
Who am I?

410
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:50,580
In becoming a monster,
your memory was lost.

411
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:53,080
If you want your memory back,

412
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,240
drink blood.

413
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,700
Are you all right?

414
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,120
You fool!

415
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:10,990
How dare you disturb the
laws of this world!

416
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:14,330
I know that you're behind
the ominous deaths!

417
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:17,330
How dare you try to live
by killing innocent people!

418
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:18,920
Innocent people?

419
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:20,620
Who?

420
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:21,740
How dare you!

421
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,790
Think you can get away with
murder because you're immortal?

422
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,950
I know how to banish you!

423
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,660
Do you want to remember?

424
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:35,580
Then watch this!

425
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:27,200
Sir! What happened!

426
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:33,290
We must get the arrow out.
Hold him down now!

427
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:38,170
That's a good idea.

428
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:41,420
But aren't we in the same class?
Stop giving me orders!

429
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:42,450
Hurry up!

430
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:46,370
I will, but watch it.

431
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:41,740
Sir?

432
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:44,250
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

433
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:50,870
Isn't she odd, sir?

434
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:53,120
Did you sense it too?

435
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:54,370
You too, sir?

436
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,620
Yes.

437
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:00,120
I thought she was strange from the start.

438
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:03,370
She goes around alone.

439
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,960
She talks down to you and gives commands.

440
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,870
She's out of this world, sir.

441
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:11,870
It all adds up to one thing.

442
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:13,490
What?

443
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:15,200
She's crazy.

444
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,950
Crazy girls don't wear flowers
on their heads these days.

445
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:23,870
Try all you want, but you can't fool me!

446
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:32,500
<i>If you want to remember, drink blood.</i>

447
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:46,120
<i>She fought off a vampire. Is she one too?</i>

448
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,120
<i>No, she's can't be.</i>

449
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,910
<i>If she is, she can't be fine in the sun.</i>

450
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:53,160
<i>And she wouldn't have saved me.</i>

451
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,990
<i>If he catches the monster
before I find my memory...</i>

452
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,120
<i>But she's similar to him.</i>

453
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,660
<i>He's arrogant, but has a useful brain.</i>

454
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:03,620
<i>She's quite arrogant.</i>

455
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:06,240
<i>But her ability to fight
him is quite useful.</i>

456
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:10,750
<i>With my brain and this woman's
body, we can catch the monster.</i>

457
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:11,870
<i>Work with her?</i>

458
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,250
<i>My brain and...</i>

459
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:15,040
<i>Seo-pil's body!</i>

460
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:17,290
Damn it!

461
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:18,580
This woman's body!

462
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:23,620
Oops. Did I say that out loud?

463
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:27,370
It's not what it sounded like.

464
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:29,700
- I mean your...
- If you help me,

465
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:31,830
I'll help you catch the monster.

466
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:32,820
But

467
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:34,700
you can't ask anything about me.

468
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:38,170
Agreed. But help you with what?

469
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:42,620
I lost my memory.

470
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:46,120
I want to know who I am.

471
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:47,870
Fine.

472
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:51,120
But there's one problem.

473
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:52,490
What is it?

474
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:53,710
You don't call me sir.

475
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,250
Then don't call me ma'am.

476
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:56,290
Really?

477
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:57,330
That works.

478
00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:01,000
Wait. Maybe not.

479
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,280
Is she really crazy?

480
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:04,790
By the way,

481
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,710
how did you know the dye maker would die?

482
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:13,990
The arrowhead from Song's corpse
had a letter which means 'to stain'.

483
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:18,750
My clever head figured out
it's a clue to his next killing...

484
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:23,450
The arrowhead!

485
00:45:34,910 --> 00:45:39,740
Oh no! Brother!

486
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:40,870
Who's that?

487
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:43,370
- Must be the dead man's brother.
- What?

488
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:46,320
He only has a younger sister.

489
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:54,750
Right. He does.

490
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,080
Then who am I?

491
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,950
Well, I'm...

492
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:01,620
I'm his sister.

493
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:24,570
Then who is he?

494
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:28,830
- Well, I'm her Hus...
- My servant.

495
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:31,170
His name is Bang-ja.

496
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:35,500
Greet me.

497
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,700
Hello, ma'am.

498
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:44,330
He's dressed in disguise to protect me.

499
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,950
He will be examined soon. Please be quick.

500
00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:51,240
- Of course, sir.
- Let's go.

501
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:52,790
Thank you, sir!

502
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:55,290
A servant?

503
00:46:56,990 --> 00:46:59,280
Find the arrowhead, Bang-ja.

504
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:18,700
Are you all right?

505
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:23,240
Our lady lost consciousness
from the shock of his death!

506
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:26,330
Oh no, ma'am!

507
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,580
I'm fine. Put me down.

508
00:47:37,370 --> 00:47:38,370
No.

509
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:41,540
Put me down! Let me off!

510
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:44,080
Pretend you're asleep, will you?

511
00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:47,660
People will think it's odd if you don't.

512
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:59,120
You really don't remember anything?

513
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,620
I don't even know my name.

514
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,240
Then let's make one.

515
00:48:08,370 --> 00:48:09,370
My name?

516
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:12,580
We'll have to go around together like this.

517
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:16,990
I can't just call you 'hey you'.

518
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:21,740
And I'm an outstanding name maker.

519
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:23,990
Listen and choose.

520
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:30,920
Bertha, Dorcas, Edna, Gretel...

521
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:32,910
Don't get cute with me.

522
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,120
Let's see.

523
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:42,080
Your fair skin is like the moon.

524
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:46,410
'Wol' means 'moon'. And you're young.

525
00:48:46,910 --> 00:48:48,450
How about Wol-young?

526
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:52,700
That's a pretty name.

527
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:01,660
Simplified 'A-gyo'...

528
00:49:02,330 --> 00:49:05,120
It could mean someone
who makes ox hide glue.

529
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:07,870
It could also mean shinbone.

530
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:10,950
So, it could be a hunter or a butcher next.

531
00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:14,000
That's so weird.

532
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:18,290
I haven't seen her eat in days.

533
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:21,990
Even if your parents die, you feel hungry.

534
00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:23,990
Why won't she eat?

535
00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:26,790
I knew a crazy girl back home.

536
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:31,080
She'd run around everywhere
without eating for almost a week.

537
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:33,620
And you know how strong they are?

538
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:36,410
They can drag a couple of men no problem!

539
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:41,160
You should be careful, sir.

540
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:44,660
Don't get involved because she's pretty.

541
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:46,490
Hi.

542
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:49,410
The flower suits you.

543
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,410
Now, let's see you smile.

544
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,040
Smile.

545
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:58,540
Don't act pretty. Just
smile like the others.

546
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,330
See? She's crazy.

547
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:06,580
- Let's go home.
- Yes, sir.

548
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,290
Hot! Hot!

549
00:51:13,330 --> 00:51:14,790
I'll protect you, sir!

550
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:38,580
Stay still!

551
00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:18,910
Sir!

552
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,620
What about me?

553
00:52:33,410 --> 00:52:34,450
Are you all right?

554
00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:36,410
I'm fine.

555
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:39,040
You got cut. How could you be fine?

556
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:41,080
- Let's see.
- It's okay.

557
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:43,250
Don't be stubborn! Give me your hand.

558
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:02,950
Who were those men?

559
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:10,370
Why change subjects? You saw it.

560
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:17,490
Some people can heal faster than others.

561
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:19,960
What if I'm not human?

562
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:25,620
What if I'm a monster like him?

563
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:34,410
You're not a monster.

564
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:38,620
Vampires can't last in the sun like you.

565
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:42,200
They crave human blood, but you don't.

566
00:53:42,490 --> 00:53:44,990
So, you're not a monster.

567
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:47,570
What do you know?

568
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:57,490
I can't control my powers.

569
00:53:57,950 --> 00:54:01,450
I can even sense the air
passing through me.

570
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:06,290
When I smell blood, I feel
a suffocating thirst.

571
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:08,960
At this rate,

572
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:14,620
I could bite your neck like that monster.

573
00:54:17,830 --> 00:54:21,960
You may become a monster after biting me,

574
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:24,120
but my neck is fine.

575
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:28,410
Your fear of becoming a monster
means you're not one yet.

576
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:34,740
All I see is a good person who's
afraid of becoming a monster.

577
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,660
Aren't you afraid of me?

578
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:44,960
I trust the human in you, Wol-young.

579
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:50,200
I trust you will not to become a monster.

580
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:55,830
You're stronger and more
upright than any man.

581
00:54:55,870 --> 00:54:58,830
I'm not afraid of you.

582
00:54:58,950 --> 00:55:02,950
I'll always keep my neck open to you.

583
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:32,370
Why don't you use the front gate?

584
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:36,910
I searched throughout Ganghwa.
I can't find her, sir.

585
00:55:37,370 --> 00:55:38,410
This is...

586
00:55:43,790 --> 00:55:45,000
No sign at all?

587
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,200
No, sir.

588
00:55:48,910 --> 00:55:50,410
I think she left Ganghwa.

589
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,040
Give me that.

590
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:53,740
Look.

591
00:55:56,370 --> 00:55:57,830
Still can't find her?

592
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:03,710
Get it now?

593
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:05,120
Have you seen her?

594
00:56:06,790 --> 00:56:09,290
Forget it. Go back home.

595
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:11,170
No, sir. I'll stay and protect you.

596
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:14,870
It's okay. Just take
good care of yourself.

597
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:16,740
Then I'll be going, sir.

598
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:20,780
- Use the gate!
- Yes, sir.

599
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:26,450
Wait.

600
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:30,240
Am I the monster in this book?

601
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:36,370
Does this look like me?

602
00:56:36,990 --> 00:56:38,450
I don't look like this!

603
00:56:38,870 --> 00:56:40,620
My teeth are straight.

604
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:49,540
And it says vampires burn in the sunlight.

605
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:51,950
But I'm fine!

606
00:56:52,830 --> 00:56:57,170
That's for vampires who
sucked human blood.

607
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:04,170
So, if I suck blood, I'd
be afraid of sunlight too?

608
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:09,070
Vampires must drink blood to survive.

609
00:57:09,410 --> 00:57:12,910
If they don't, they'll go weak.

610
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:14,620
Then

611
00:57:15,410 --> 00:57:16,660
they'll die!

612
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:20,660
Look.

613
00:57:22,290 --> 00:57:23,670
You're scared of me, right?

614
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:28,910
Yes.

615
00:57:29,490 --> 00:57:32,370
What's so funny here?

616
00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:34,490
I could hear you outside!

617
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:37,370
Think of our history together!

618
00:57:37,410 --> 00:57:39,080
All those nights together!

619
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:41,580
How can you ditch me for a crazy girl?

620
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:45,200
You'll regret leaving me someday, sir!

621
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:48,750
You're so lucky, bitch.

622
00:57:51,410 --> 00:57:55,740
If I ever bite someone, he'd be the first.

623
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:57,620
By the way, sir.

624
00:57:57,660 --> 00:58:01,160
I must have menopause.

625
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:03,990
I keep getting hot flashes.

626
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:05,790
See? I'm burning inside!

627
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:07,870
I'm hot! Get back!

628
00:58:07,910 --> 00:58:09,240
Don't do this!

629
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:10,370
Get back, sir!

630
00:58:10,410 --> 00:58:12,330
What are you staring at?

631
00:58:12,370 --> 00:58:14,290
Get ready! We have to go!

632
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:18,160
Don't be a burden on us.

633
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:20,370
She won't budge.

634
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:21,330
Why you!

635
00:58:21,410 --> 00:58:23,700
Stop! You're asking to die!

636
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:25,410
What's with you, sir?

637
00:58:32,290 --> 00:58:33,420
What are you doing?

638
00:58:33,450 --> 00:58:34,620
Stop it, sir!

639
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:36,120
Are you a pervert?

640
00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:45,160
What's wrong?

641
00:58:46,790 --> 00:58:48,580
Get away! Stop!

642
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:16,750
Did it really say 'A-gyo' on the arrowhead?

643
00:59:17,330 --> 00:59:21,120
Why? You think I can't even read?

644
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:22,490
Just let me see.

645
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:27,420
No way! I'm mad you think I can't read!

646
00:59:27,450 --> 00:59:29,290
I'll bite you!

647
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:36,240
It's a simplified character.

648
00:59:36,830 --> 00:59:39,920
Simplified characters were made to...

649
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:41,120
Wol-gyo.

650
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:44,040
You read it wrong.

651
00:59:44,370 --> 00:59:45,750
I knew it was Wol-gyo.

652
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:47,620
Of course, I knew.

653
00:59:49,370 --> 00:59:51,540
I was right again.

654
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:54,960
This pond is called Wol-gyo.

655
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,620
Ganghwa Hall used to be here.

656
00:59:58,870 --> 01:00:00,250
Ganghwa Hall?

657
01:00:00,290 --> 01:00:04,120
Some say it's the revenge of those
who died in the Ganghwa Hall fire.

658
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:08,870
Then the next victim must
be connected to this place.

659
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:13,990
If the fire here was plotted
to kill innocent lives,

660
01:00:14,790 --> 01:00:19,080
he's killing those
involved to get revenge?

661
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:21,830
That ghastly fool!

662
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:28,830
He must have his reasons.

663
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:35,740
The monster must've once been a human too.

664
01:00:37,830 --> 01:00:38,830
Like me.

665
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:45,250
There's sadness in his eyes.

666
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:55,790
Didn't you lose your memory?

667
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:58,990
How do you know about Ganghwa Hall?

668
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:01,990
I'm not sure.

669
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:04,960
It just came to me.

670
01:01:06,870 --> 01:01:09,450
I saw Ganghwa Hall here.

671
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:38,330
The arrowhead pointed to Ganghwa Hall?

672
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:42,120
The next victim is connected
to the fire 30 years ago.

673
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:45,830
Ask realtors and find out
why Ganghwa Hall is gone.

674
01:01:46,450 --> 01:01:48,700
I'll investigate more on Ha Byung-eun.

675
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:59,670
He must be Ha Byung-eun's father.

676
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:17,420
Why hold a sacrifice instead of
wishing his son's spirit well?

677
01:02:54,830 --> 01:02:55,830
Nan?

678
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:03,960
Have you forgotten?

679
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:09,000
Did you think it was over?

680
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:15,200
You watched me die, but lived comfortably?

681
01:03:18,490 --> 01:03:22,030
Just as you murdered my wife and son,

682
01:03:22,830 --> 01:03:25,460
I'll destroy you and your family!

683
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:29,040
Forgive me!

684
01:03:31,950 --> 01:03:34,790
I deserve to die!

685
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:15,120
I couldn't protect you to the end.

686
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:17,120
I'm sorry.

687
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:21,740
Son!

688
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:31,530
- Ganghwa Hall?
- Yes.

689
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:36,040
I heard Ganghwa Hall
burned down 30 years ago.

690
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:37,620
What happened?

691
01:04:38,910 --> 01:04:40,540
It wasn't just a fire.

692
01:04:43,410 --> 01:04:44,410
It was treason.

693
01:04:45,290 --> 01:04:46,080
Treason?

694
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:51,660
They say that the Crown
Prince was poisoned there.

695
01:04:52,290 --> 01:04:57,830
So, the Jeong family was annihilated
and a pond was made there.

696
01:04:58,040 --> 01:05:02,460
The Jeong family owned Ganghwa Hall?

697
01:05:07,790 --> 01:05:09,580
He killed your son!

698
01:05:09,620 --> 01:05:10,790
Who is he?

699
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:12,410
Jeong In-yul!

700
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:15,540
The Jeong family has been loyal
to the king for generations.

701
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:19,330
Jeong In-yul and his father
were very loyal too.

702
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:25,080
But they were executed
for plotting treason.

703
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:26,670
Jeong In-yul...

704
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:31,370
He's back from hell!

705
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:33,370
Jeong In-yul...

706
01:05:46,540 --> 01:05:47,540
A royal award?

707
01:05:47,910 --> 01:05:51,370
For those who reported the
Crown Prince's murder?

708
01:05:52,290 --> 01:05:54,540
Hong Jeong-ho, Song Gap-young, Ha Il-ju...

709
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:56,080
Hong...

710
01:05:56,490 --> 01:05:58,280
Hong Tae-mun, Song Pil-geun, Ha Byung-eun!

711
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:01,620
He killed the sons of those here in order!

712
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:03,830
There must be two more names.

713
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:05,240
Choi Il-kyu?

714
01:06:05,660 --> 01:06:08,370
- The owner of Yeon-mi Lodge?
- Yes.

715
01:06:08,950 --> 01:06:12,290
The land and building
belonged to the Jeong family.

716
01:06:12,330 --> 01:06:15,670
But after they died, everything
went to Choi Il-kyu.

717
01:06:16,410 --> 01:06:19,870
Then the next target must
be his son, Jae-kyung.

718
01:06:20,290 --> 01:06:24,710
He knew his turn would come,
so he read up on monsters.

719
01:06:25,290 --> 01:06:26,290
Jeong In-yul...

720
01:06:26,790 --> 01:06:30,420
He's getting revenge on those
who reported the treason.

721
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:36,160
Today's the 12th!

722
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:37,620
What about it, sir?

723
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:39,200
Hong Tae-mun died on the 3rd.

724
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:40,490
Song died on the 6th.

725
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:42,170
And Ha died on the 9th!

726
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:45,120
There's no time!

727
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:49,080
We can't fight a vampire
with our bare hands!

728
01:06:51,410 --> 01:06:53,450
Then how do we stop it, sir?

729
01:06:53,830 --> 01:06:56,290
Strike it with silver or burn it!

730
01:06:56,740 --> 01:07:00,660
If you don't burn its heart,
it could be revived with blood.

731
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:42,120
The killer will come here tonight.

732
01:07:42,910 --> 01:07:46,620
He has extraordinary skills
and won't be easy to fight.

733
01:07:46,950 --> 01:07:48,410
You must shoot...

734
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:58,330
You must shoot him with fiery arrows!

735
01:07:58,660 --> 01:07:59,660
Yes, sir!

736
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:24,240
Jeong In-yul!

737
01:09:27,410 --> 01:09:31,160
You and your father
poisoned the Crown Prince!

738
01:09:31,370 --> 01:09:34,000
But you want revenge?

739
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:36,160
Rather than repent,

740
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:38,160
you took innocent lives!

741
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:40,790
You will pay for your crime!

742
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:43,580
Pay for my crime?

743
01:09:44,660 --> 01:09:47,450
You'll die here too!

744
01:10:11,870 --> 01:10:13,200
Pain, you say?

745
01:10:14,290 --> 01:10:16,580
What do you know about never-ending pain!

746
01:10:17,410 --> 01:10:21,040
How dare you tell me to pay for my crime!

747
01:10:26,370 --> 01:10:27,540
Put him down.

748
01:10:31,620 --> 01:10:33,950
Though you seek blood now,

749
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:36,830
were you not once a man of honor?

750
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:43,000
Since your memory isn't back,

751
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:46,530
you must not know how you died.

752
01:10:49,950 --> 01:10:50,950
Why?

753
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:54,080
Think your death was different from mine?

754
01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:57,870
When you remember how you
died and who killed you,

755
01:10:58,410 --> 01:11:01,870
you'll become just like me.

756
01:11:01,910 --> 01:11:02,910
No.

757
01:11:03,330 --> 01:11:05,250
I won't be a monster like you.

758
01:11:05,870 --> 01:11:07,160
Drink blood.

759
01:11:08,370 --> 01:11:11,040
Find your painful memories

760
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:14,870
and get revenge on the
day of the full moon!

761
01:11:59,790 --> 01:12:01,290
You must live!

762
01:12:24,270 --> 01:12:27,520
You want to turn me into a real vampire?

763
01:12:30,390 --> 01:12:32,680
Why did you try to give me blood?

764
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:36,890
I wanted to save you.

765
01:12:39,770 --> 01:12:40,770
Why?

766
01:12:45,350 --> 01:12:47,600
What if I bite you?

767
01:12:48,350 --> 01:12:49,890
You'll become a vampire too.

768
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:53,310
Do you wish to live on innocent blood?

769
01:12:54,810 --> 01:12:59,100
Even so, I would never drink
someone else's blood.

770
01:13:04,770 --> 01:13:08,480
Then I'll bite Seo-pil for you,
so you won't be lonely.

771
01:13:20,810 --> 01:13:23,810
Being with the crazy girl,
you've lost your mind, sir.

772
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:03,560
Yes, ma'am.

773
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:16,690
<i>SIR HA IL-JU AND CHOI IL-KYU DIED</i>

774
01:14:18,270 --> 01:14:22,980
<i>No warnings this time?
There must be another target.</i>

775
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:28,270
Seo-pil? Wake up.

776
01:14:28,310 --> 01:14:30,230
Let me hold your hand.

777
01:14:30,690 --> 01:14:32,570
I said wake up!

778
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:03,140
<i>I'll bite Seo-pil for you.</i>

779
01:15:16,890 --> 01:15:19,060
Get dressed, already!

780
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:20,440
Yes, sir.

781
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:23,390
Someone will die in 3 days.

782
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:25,770
We must find the last informer before then.

783
01:15:39,230 --> 01:15:42,270
Choi Il-kyu must have the royal award too.

784
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:46,480
Why hide a proud certificate?

785
01:15:47,940 --> 01:15:50,070
Was he ashamed of it?

786
01:15:59,770 --> 01:16:01,520
The full moon is in 3 days.

787
01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:04,230
It's when the spirits'
powers are the strongest!

788
01:16:04,270 --> 01:16:05,270
Wait!

789
01:16:05,890 --> 01:16:07,810
The Full Moon Fest...

790
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:10,270
His Majesty will be here!

791
01:16:10,310 --> 01:16:11,310
Sir?

792
01:16:11,770 --> 01:16:13,150
Please run away.

793
01:16:14,230 --> 01:16:16,190
I can't protect you any longer!

794
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:32,850
What do you fools want?

795
01:16:32,890 --> 01:16:33,890
Sir!

796
01:16:34,730 --> 01:16:37,650
Stay back. I'll handle them.

797
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:39,600
But...

798
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:43,690
I'm immortal now, sir.

799
01:16:44,350 --> 01:16:45,770
My body is on fire.

800
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:48,270
I can't control my new powers!

801
01:16:48,730 --> 01:16:51,110
- Seo-pil! Actually...
- Listen!

802
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:54,640
I'll have mercy and give you time to run.

803
01:16:54,690 --> 01:16:58,690
Or else today will be
your last day as humans!

804
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:04,230
Foolish thugs!

805
01:17:05,270 --> 01:17:09,600
I'll feast off your blood!

806
01:17:10,060 --> 01:17:12,350
I drew the bite marks on you!

807
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:26,970
You have what I want.

808
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:30,600
If you give it to me, I'll go quietly.

809
01:17:35,810 --> 01:17:37,810
This will help you decide.

810
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:43,100
Stop!

811
01:18:07,730 --> 01:18:12,520
When I awoke in the mountain,
a monk gave it to me.

812
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:16,110
The case 30 years ago...

813
01:18:16,850 --> 01:18:19,980
Maybe the perpetrators and
victims should be switched.

814
01:18:20,810 --> 01:18:23,770
Those thugs are trying to hide something!

815
01:18:24,190 --> 01:18:27,690
What did they want? What was inside?

816
01:18:30,060 --> 01:18:34,690
It was a scroll with strange secret codes.

817
01:18:34,730 --> 01:18:35,730
Secret codes?

818
01:18:37,350 --> 01:18:40,190
My clever brain would've solved it!

819
01:18:40,230 --> 01:18:41,520
What a pity.

820
01:18:42,390 --> 01:18:43,390
Dang!

821
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:45,480
- Why you little!
- What?

822
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:46,690
I remember!

823
01:18:57,350 --> 01:19:00,560
Secret codes are written
with certain patterns.

824
01:19:00,850 --> 01:19:03,480
If you find the pattern, it can be read.

825
01:19:16,060 --> 01:19:18,600
Where's that clever brain of yours?

826
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:19,810
Huh, sir?

827
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:49,600
I knew it!

828
01:19:50,390 --> 01:19:51,390
I was wrong.

829
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:54,690
Could you write up another one?

830
01:19:58,140 --> 01:20:00,100
Right here! Just bite him!

831
01:20:14,230 --> 01:20:15,480
Get back, sir.

832
01:20:17,890 --> 01:20:19,470
You're confusing me!

833
01:20:30,310 --> 01:20:31,310
Wait!

834
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:33,520
They used Korean alphabet!

835
01:20:37,310 --> 01:20:41,730
The 1st and 3rd lines are consonants
written with vertical symmetry.

836
01:20:41,770 --> 01:20:45,560
The middle line has vowels
drawn with triangles.

837
01:20:46,060 --> 01:20:49,520
The circles mean 'A'.
The triangles mean 'O' or 'U'.

838
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:53,310
Circles with lines mean 'E' and so on.

839
01:20:59,230 --> 01:21:03,480
<i>POISON THE CROWN PRINCE AND FRAME
JEONG IN-YUL AND HIS FATHER</i>

840
01:21:04,190 --> 01:21:05,190
I knew it!

841
01:21:06,980 --> 01:21:10,190
Those who reported the treason
were the real traitors!

842
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:11,640
What do you mean?

843
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:14,480
It's a conspiracy pact.

844
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:17,230
The Crown Prince's death was fabricated!

845
01:21:17,730 --> 01:21:19,520
Those who poisoned him

846
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:23,600
framed it on Jeong In-yul
and his father as treason!

847
01:21:26,140 --> 01:21:29,310
So, Jeong In-yul is
getting revenge on them?

848
01:21:29,770 --> 01:21:32,020
What do you know about never-ending pain!

849
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:34,650
I don't know how he became a vampire.

850
01:21:34,980 --> 01:21:36,940
But by killing the traitors' sons,

851
01:21:37,270 --> 01:21:40,230
he wanted them to suffer
more pain than death.

852
01:21:41,060 --> 01:21:43,480
He'll kill the last traitor's son next!

853
01:21:45,310 --> 01:21:46,730
Song Gap-young.

854
01:21:47,060 --> 01:21:48,730
Ha Il-ju.

855
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:50,520
Choi Il-kyu.

856
01:21:51,100 --> 01:21:51,940
And

857
01:21:51,980 --> 01:21:53,230
Kim...

858
01:21:55,810 --> 01:21:57,390
And who, sir?

859
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:00,730
Kim Shin?

860
01:22:02,020 --> 01:22:03,020
Kim Shin?

861
01:22:03,890 --> 01:22:05,810
Your father, sir?

862
01:22:07,940 --> 01:22:09,940
Jeong In-yul knew me.

863
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:13,940
How dare you tell me to pay for my crime!

864
01:22:14,390 --> 01:22:16,770
He knows I'm the last informer's son.

865
01:22:19,690 --> 01:22:20,860
Kim Shin?

866
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:39,820
What brings you here, Min?

867
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:24,640
Give me blood.

868
01:23:26,730 --> 01:23:27,730
I want...

869
01:23:30,140 --> 01:23:31,140
blood.

870
01:23:55,060 --> 01:23:57,190
The subjects are watching.

871
01:23:57,770 --> 01:23:58,770
Let them.

872
01:24:00,190 --> 01:24:03,480
I should hold my beloved's
hand on a night like this.

873
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:06,270
Mother!

874
01:24:06,310 --> 01:24:07,890
Father!

875
01:24:09,190 --> 01:24:10,230
Prince!

876
01:24:10,730 --> 01:24:13,070
Our son must've had a bad dream.

877
01:24:19,940 --> 01:24:23,690
What happened 30 years ago?

878
01:24:26,980 --> 01:24:30,900
Jeong In-yul is the one who called me here.

879
01:24:31,140 --> 01:24:33,470
Jeong In-yul died!

880
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:36,770
I saw it with my own eyes!

881
01:24:37,230 --> 01:24:41,150
If you don't tell me,
I'll hear it from him.

882
01:24:41,690 --> 01:24:43,020
I did it for you!

883
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:47,060
Did you make a wish?

884
01:24:49,940 --> 01:24:50,940
Yes, sir.

885
01:24:51,230 --> 01:24:53,730
I wished for His Majesty's

886
01:24:53,770 --> 01:24:56,190
<i>JEONG IN-YUL</i>
quick recovery, Your Highness.

887
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:03,760
You make me an unfilial son.

888
01:25:03,790 --> 01:25:06,210
How is that so, Your Highness?

889
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:11,380
The world knows you tend to
His Majesty every night.

890
01:25:11,420 --> 01:25:14,210
I just did what a subject should.

891
01:25:15,670 --> 01:25:16,670
I was kidding.

892
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:21,210
Your Highness?

893
01:25:21,790 --> 01:25:23,420
What did you wish for?

894
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:27,260
I wished for Joseon

895
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,880
to be returned to its owner.

896
01:25:32,290 --> 01:25:34,960
Joseon belongs to His Majesty and you, sir.

897
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:39,210
A king should not be the
owner of a country.

898
01:25:40,290 --> 01:25:43,370
The people should be.

899
01:25:45,250 --> 01:25:47,590
Joseon doesn't belong to the people now.

900
01:25:49,210 --> 01:25:52,210
Those who must work for
the people rule them.

901
01:25:52,630 --> 01:25:55,380
They make factions and fight
to keep what's theirs.

902
01:25:55,670 --> 01:25:58,550
They try to control the
king and alienate others.

903
01:25:59,250 --> 01:26:01,630
They frame their opposers as traitors.

904
01:26:04,090 --> 01:26:05,970
They're the ones who own Joseon.

905
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:10,880
When I become king,

906
01:26:12,290 --> 01:26:16,040
I'll take Joseon away from them
and give it back to the people.

907
01:26:18,290 --> 01:26:20,170
I trust you will, sir.

908
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:24,750
See the lanterns?

909
01:26:25,290 --> 01:26:28,750
Do you know what the people wished for?

910
01:26:30,540 --> 01:26:32,870
The people make small cries.

911
01:26:33,340 --> 01:26:35,920
It's their leaders who raise their voices.

912
01:26:41,340 --> 01:26:45,220
Joseon doesn't need people
to talk for the civilians.

913
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:49,420
We need people to listen
to their small cries.

914
01:26:50,250 --> 01:26:57,880
I want to make it so that civilians
will not suffer from hunger and pain.

915
01:27:01,790 --> 01:27:04,790
Did you find anything?

916
01:27:08,380 --> 01:27:11,590
It's been long since I
sent you to Ganghwa Hall.

917
01:27:12,340 --> 01:27:14,260
Promise me first, sir.

918
01:27:14,290 --> 01:27:15,870
You found a way?

919
01:27:16,630 --> 01:27:17,630
Tell me.

920
01:27:19,420 --> 01:27:20,840
Why are you hesitating?

921
01:27:21,380 --> 01:27:26,090
Do you wish to see your
entire family be annihilated?

922
01:27:36,170 --> 01:27:37,050
What is it?

923
01:27:37,090 --> 01:27:39,010
The Crown Prince has passed away!

924
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:40,040
What?

925
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:42,460
But how?

926
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:45,500
Sir! Sir!

927
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:48,290
Please run away! Your
father's been arrested!

928
01:27:48,340 --> 01:27:49,340
My father? Why?

929
01:27:49,380 --> 01:27:51,840
That he poisoned His Highness...

930
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:53,170
That's preposterous!

931
01:27:58,630 --> 01:28:00,720
Your Highness! You must leave at once.

932
01:28:01,170 --> 01:28:02,460
What do you mean?

933
01:28:03,210 --> 01:28:04,290
Where is His Highness?

934
01:28:07,630 --> 01:28:10,130
The young prince is in danger.
Please change.

935
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:17,500
Let's go.

936
01:28:19,790 --> 01:28:20,790
Where are you going?

937
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:24,260
You know very well that my
father would never do this.

938
01:28:24,290 --> 01:28:25,370
He's been framed!

939
01:28:25,420 --> 01:28:29,300
Those who killed His Highness
will be after the prince.

940
01:28:42,420 --> 01:28:43,420
Your Highness!

941
01:28:43,460 --> 01:28:44,880
Please follow me.

942
01:30:03,290 --> 01:30:04,290
Your Highness?

943
01:30:04,340 --> 01:30:05,380
Please sit here.

944
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:11,960
They won't come here.

945
01:30:14,750 --> 01:30:15,750
Thank you.

946
01:30:17,670 --> 01:30:19,920
How could you come in here?

947
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:21,710
Haven't you heard about this ship?

948
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:23,040
It's a revolt.

949
01:30:23,290 --> 01:30:26,750
We must protect the prince
until things settle down.

950
01:30:33,250 --> 01:30:34,130
In-yul!

951
01:30:34,210 --> 01:30:35,210
Run away!

952
01:30:36,460 --> 01:30:39,750
Protect them no matter what!

953
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:44,840
Hurry!

954
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:52,260
But it's treason, sir! I can't do it.

955
01:30:52,290 --> 01:30:53,290
You fool!

956
01:30:54,630 --> 01:30:56,090
It's not treason.

957
01:30:57,040 --> 01:31:00,540
The Crown Prince becoming king is treason!

958
01:31:02,130 --> 01:31:06,720
He's filled with absurd ideals!
If he becomes king, Joseon will fall!

959
01:31:07,670 --> 01:31:10,920
<i>A country does not thrive on ideals alone!</i>

960
01:31:11,710 --> 01:31:18,250
<i>The only way to save your family
is to bring down the Crown Prince!</i>

961
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:31,130
What are you doing?

962
01:31:36,630 --> 01:31:37,630
Please...

963
01:31:38,460 --> 01:31:40,250
Please let the prince live?

964
01:31:53,590 --> 01:31:54,720
Open the door.

965
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:56,620
Open it now!

966
01:31:57,540 --> 01:32:00,870
Just let the prince live!

967
01:32:00,920 --> 01:32:03,710
Please save the prince!

968
01:32:04,420 --> 01:32:05,420
No!

969
01:32:10,210 --> 01:32:14,040
It would've been better to
die than to beg for life.

970
01:32:15,170 --> 01:32:16,170
You fool!

971
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:21,130
If I didn't do that, our family
would've been annihilated!

972
01:32:21,670 --> 01:32:25,170
I abandoned my friend and the Crown Prince

973
01:32:25,670 --> 01:32:27,210
to save you!

974
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:33,840
You mean, this is all because of me?

975
01:32:34,630 --> 01:32:36,880
You did all that for me?

976
01:32:37,210 --> 01:32:40,090
Then what makes me different
from the monster?

977
01:32:40,710 --> 01:32:44,840
I lived well in a family that
thrived on innocent blood!

978
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:46,920
Then I'm a monster too!

979
01:33:04,710 --> 01:33:05,840
Scour the area!

980
01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:07,960
Yes, sir!

981
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:19,040
Prince...

982
01:33:20,710 --> 01:33:22,040
You must survive.

983
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:24,970
Search there!

984
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:49,920
Find them!

985
01:34:02,590 --> 01:34:03,880
Don't let them get away!

986
01:34:12,340 --> 01:34:14,010
Corner her and catch her!

987
01:34:35,300 --> 01:34:36,550
Mother?

988
01:34:36,590 --> 01:34:41,920
If snow falls before the balsam fades,

989
01:34:41,970 --> 01:34:46,350
I heard you can meet the one you miss.

990
01:34:46,930 --> 01:34:48,060
Prince?

991
01:34:48,510 --> 01:34:51,090
Where did you hear that?

992
01:34:51,140 --> 01:34:57,850
It doesn't matter for
me if the balsam fades.

993
01:34:58,300 --> 01:34:59,300
Why?

994
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:02,590
Even if you can't meet the one you miss?

995
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:07,470
I'll live with you and Father forever.

996
01:35:07,510 --> 01:35:10,590
I won't miss anyone.

997
01:35:33,390 --> 01:35:35,220
You were Sun...

998
01:35:40,180 --> 01:35:42,310
My son, Sun...

999
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:50,590
I didn't even hold your hand.

1000
01:35:53,640 --> 01:35:55,270
You died...

1001
01:35:58,930 --> 01:36:01,930
before even calling me mother.

1002
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:08,180
I'm sorry.

1003
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:13,430
I'm so sorry.

1004
01:36:28,010 --> 01:36:29,010
Your Highness!

1005
01:36:29,510 --> 01:36:30,550
I, Jeong In-yul,

1006
01:36:31,010 --> 01:36:34,260
was disloyal in being
deceived by a greedy friend.

1007
01:36:35,090 --> 01:36:38,630
I will punish him for harming
the Crown Prince and prince.

1008
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:46,920
I'll burn everything he
owns once and for all!

1009
01:36:48,050 --> 01:36:51,140
He will come tomorrow
during the Full Moon Fest.

1010
01:36:51,640 --> 01:36:53,470
That puts His Majesty in harms way!

1011
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:55,550
We must reveal everything.

1012
01:36:56,300 --> 01:36:57,720
Even if I must die,

1013
01:36:58,260 --> 01:37:00,970
I'll reveal your crimes, Father!

1014
01:37:06,930 --> 01:37:09,310
Lock him away at once!

1015
01:37:58,550 --> 01:37:59,550
Sir!

1016
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:01,880
Stay back!

1017
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:07,640
<i>I'm their owner's son.
They'll never harm me.</i>

1018
01:38:10,180 --> 01:38:12,020
Stay back or else!

1019
01:38:12,260 --> 01:38:13,300
This sir...

1020
01:38:13,340 --> 01:38:15,550
This fool is dead!

1021
01:38:16,050 --> 01:38:17,760
I said stay back!

1022
01:38:21,090 --> 01:38:22,220
My toe!

1023
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:24,510
- Are you all right?
- I have gout!

1024
01:38:58,890 --> 01:38:59,890
Giddy up!

1025
01:39:00,140 --> 01:39:01,140
Giddy up!

1026
01:39:02,470 --> 01:39:03,470
Giddy up!

1027
01:39:32,840 --> 01:39:33,840
Giddy up!

1028
01:39:35,970 --> 01:39:37,260
What are you doing?

1029
01:39:37,300 --> 01:39:39,260
I'll protect you! Grab the reins!

1030
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:41,260
Seo-pil!

1031
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:55,890
My gout!

1032
01:41:54,260 --> 01:41:55,340
Were you scared?

1033
01:41:57,760 --> 01:42:02,010
Scared people will disdain
you if they own Joseon?

1034
01:42:05,300 --> 01:42:07,510
Scared you'll lose everything?

1035
01:42:11,180 --> 01:42:16,600
Scared my young son will
live and reveal your sins?

1036
01:42:46,390 --> 01:42:47,850
I've been waiting.

1037
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:52,180
I could strike you in the heart.

1038
01:42:54,220 --> 01:42:57,010
Please don't hesitate, Wol-young.

1039
01:42:59,090 --> 01:43:03,760
You must be so angry to
have to come back like this.

1040
01:43:05,140 --> 01:43:06,390
I must die

1041
01:43:07,010 --> 01:43:10,510
so your anger can be
resolved in the least bit.

1042
01:43:11,930 --> 01:43:17,430
I hope this will pay for
some of my father's sins.

1043
01:43:18,180 --> 01:43:20,770
Your father did not
only take away my life,

1044
01:43:22,390 --> 01:43:24,270
but my son and husband too.

1045
01:43:25,390 --> 01:43:30,220
We just wanted to be together.

1046
01:43:32,430 --> 01:43:34,140
That's all we wanted.

1047
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:36,680
But

1048
01:43:37,470 --> 01:43:41,260
you enjoyed the last 30 years
upon their unjust deaths.

1049
01:43:42,260 --> 01:43:43,890
You ask me to kill you?

1050
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:47,800
Fine.

1051
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:51,640
I'll kill you again and again!

1052
01:44:06,720 --> 01:44:08,800
<i>I want to know who I am.</i>

1053
01:44:09,470 --> 01:44:13,930
<i>Perhaps you lived in the distant past.</i>

1054
01:44:14,260 --> 01:44:15,720
Maybe 100 years ago?

1055
01:44:16,300 --> 01:44:17,390
That long?

1056
01:44:18,470 --> 01:44:19,800
Then I'd be so old.

1057
01:44:20,010 --> 01:44:21,890
Shall I call you granny?

1058
01:44:21,930 --> 01:44:24,640
No! I'd rather be called a monster.

1059
01:45:51,140 --> 01:45:52,890
It was exactly 30 years ago.

1060
01:45:53,550 --> 01:45:56,090
Trying to save you, I became a monster.

1061
01:45:56,930 --> 01:45:57,930
But you!

1062
01:45:58,760 --> 01:46:02,260
To fill your filthy mouth,
you killed the Crown Prince!

1063
01:46:02,840 --> 01:46:04,630
And my father and I!

1064
01:46:08,680 --> 01:46:09,680
Jeong In-yul!

1065
01:46:16,840 --> 01:46:19,880
I know the truth to your unjust suffering!

1066
01:46:20,340 --> 01:46:23,840
I'll reveal everything, so stop this!

1067
01:46:25,010 --> 01:46:26,050
The truth?

1068
01:46:27,090 --> 01:46:28,010
That's right!

1069
01:46:28,050 --> 01:46:29,050
Tonight!

1070
01:46:30,680 --> 01:46:35,270
The truth will burn you alive!

1071
01:46:57,720 --> 01:46:58,720
No!

1072
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:11,970
Die you evil monster!

1073
01:47:17,430 --> 01:47:19,350
You call me a monster?

1074
01:47:21,720 --> 01:47:24,220
After knowing what your father did to me?

1075
01:47:24,510 --> 01:47:27,720
How dare you call me a monster?

1076
01:47:28,140 --> 01:47:29,470
30 years ago,

1077
01:47:31,010 --> 01:47:34,010
you became a monster to save a friend.

1078
01:47:35,140 --> 01:47:36,180
But now!

1079
01:47:36,890 --> 01:47:40,810
You kill innocent people for revenge!

1080
01:47:41,180 --> 01:47:43,310
And threaten His Majesty's life!

1081
01:47:44,300 --> 01:47:46,590
You're just a monster!

1082
01:48:01,090 --> 01:48:02,220
Now, die!

1083
01:48:13,390 --> 01:48:14,470
Your Highness!

1084
01:48:15,640 --> 01:48:17,220
You've done enough.

1085
01:48:17,470 --> 01:48:18,600
No, Your Highness!

1086
01:48:19,180 --> 01:48:21,850
He must die to finish my revenge.

1087
01:48:26,390 --> 01:48:29,350
Those who made us into
monsters are all dead.

1088
01:48:31,010 --> 01:48:32,140
Stop.

1089
01:48:34,930 --> 01:48:36,270
It's over now.

1090
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:45,390
I don't know how to stop.

1091
01:48:47,260 --> 01:48:49,260
My father is still alive in my heart.

1092
01:48:50,430 --> 01:48:55,850
His Highness and the prince
must be alive in you too!

1093
01:48:56,090 --> 01:48:59,800
I can't stop here.

1094
01:49:25,590 --> 01:49:27,720
You know very well

1095
01:49:28,760 --> 01:49:32,260
that we should not have come back to life.

1096
01:49:34,550 --> 01:49:37,640
We're just monsters who crave human blood.

1097
01:49:40,510 --> 01:49:43,890
Though we've gotten our revenge,

1098
01:49:46,430 --> 01:49:49,640
we can only live on the
blood of innocent people.

1099
01:49:52,720 --> 01:49:54,430
We've done enough.

1100
01:49:55,930 --> 01:49:57,600
It's time to go.

1101
01:50:09,050 --> 01:50:10,510
I, Jeong In-yul,

1102
01:50:11,720 --> 01:50:13,800
shall go to the Crown Prince first.

1103
01:50:17,010 --> 01:50:19,220
Forgive me, Your Highness.

1104
01:51:04,590 --> 01:51:05,470
Your Highness!

1105
01:51:05,510 --> 01:51:06,680
Please go inside!

1106
01:51:30,550 --> 01:51:32,550
What is time?

1107
01:51:32,590 --> 01:51:35,090
Please hide from the sunlight!

1108
01:51:38,180 --> 01:51:43,270
Waiting is only possible in time.

1109
01:51:53,680 --> 01:51:56,430
But the balsam stain remains...

1110
01:52:00,140 --> 01:52:02,970
Will I meet the ones I miss?

1111
01:53:08,890 --> 01:53:10,770
I missed you so much.

1112
01:53:44,050 --> 01:53:45,340
30 years ago,

1113
01:53:45,680 --> 01:53:50,560
Kim Shin poisoned the Crown Prince
and framed the Jeong family.

1114
01:53:51,050 --> 01:53:54,140
Thus, seize all his assets and servants.

1115
01:53:54,470 --> 01:53:58,600
Although his son revealed everything,

1116
01:53:58,890 --> 01:54:05,220
Kim Min must also be
beheaded to uphold the law!

1117
01:54:15,140 --> 01:54:17,520
<i>A MONTH LATER</i>

1118
01:54:29,010 --> 01:54:31,840
I heard you've gone a little cuckoo.

1119
01:54:32,180 --> 01:54:33,470
Maybe a lot.

1120
01:54:35,800 --> 01:54:41,760
He's coming! He's coming for me!

1121
01:54:41,800 --> 01:54:44,640
Who? Who's coming for you?

1122
01:54:45,680 --> 01:54:47,220
He came in my dreams.

1123
01:54:48,090 --> 01:54:50,470
He said he's coming for me!

1124
01:54:51,470 --> 01:54:54,260
So weak for a young fellow.

1125
01:55:03,220 --> 01:55:04,970
If you're a man, state your name!

1126
01:55:05,010 --> 01:55:06,970
If you're a ghost, go away!

1127
01:55:15,390 --> 01:55:16,390
It's me!

1128
01:55:27,140 --> 01:55:29,020
I waited so long.

1129
01:55:38,470 --> 01:55:39,470
Your Majesty!

1130
01:55:42,300 --> 01:55:43,760
You're already dead.

1131
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:49,010
Kim Min no longer exists in Joseon.

1132
01:55:51,300 --> 01:55:57,510
There are many things you
must do for me in secret.

1133
01:56:00,090 --> 01:56:03,050
What did His Majesty command?

1134
01:56:03,470 --> 01:56:05,180
A month ago, in Andong,

1135
01:56:05,470 --> 01:56:09,390
the dead started to come
back to life and eat people.

1136
01:56:09,800 --> 01:56:10,890
Man-eating dead?

1137
01:56:10,930 --> 01:56:11,930
Yes!

1138
01:56:12,050 --> 01:56:14,390
They exist but do not.

1139
01:56:14,590 --> 01:56:18,550
They are called zombies.

1140
01:56:18,930 --> 01:56:19,930
Oh really?

1141
01:56:20,760 --> 01:56:21,760
Good luck!

1142
01:56:21,890 --> 01:56:24,140
Wait! Come with me!

1143
01:56:33,300 --> 01:56:38,050
