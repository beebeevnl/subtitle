1
0:0:2.420 --> 0:0:3.655
(WHISTLES)

2
0:0:6.259 --> 0:0:7.994
(GROWLING)

3
0:0:9.395 --> 0:0:11.029
(WHIRRING)

4
0:0:22.641 --> 0:0:23.977
(BARKING)

5
0:0:39.924 --> 0:0:41.426
(YELLING)

6
0:0:42.794 --> 0:0:44.997
No, Miss Poppy!
(SCREAMING)

7
0:1:4.317 --> 0:1:5.417
Good job!

8
0:1:5.449 --> 0:1:6.953
(PANTING)

9
0:1:6.986 --> 0:1:9.087
See my salon across the way?

10
0:1:12.424 --> 0:1:14.427
Head there for your makeover.

11
0:1:20.366 --> 0:1:21.634
(SIZZLING)

12
0:1:24.569 --> 0:1:27.472
PRINCESS TILDE: Eggsy,
I hope you're hungry.

13
0:1:30.275 --> 0:1:33.212
Oh, babe, I was gonna
grab breakfast at work.

14
0:1:33.245 --> 0:1:34.513
This looks lovely,
but I'm running late.

15
0:1:34.547 --> 0:1:37.883
I just thought maybe
we could practice?

16
0:1:37.915 --> 0:1:39.017
For tonight.

17
0:1:39.050 --> 0:1:40.752
Practice?
Mm-hmm.

18
0:1:40.785 --> 0:1:41.786
Eating?

19
0:1:41.821 --> 0:1:44.991
You said you've never
eaten at a palace before.

20
0:1:45.024 --> 0:1:48.794
And Pappa is sort of picky
about table manners.

21
0:1:48.828 --> 0:1:51.863
Well, as it happens, babe,
I've got this shit on lock.

22
0:1:51.896 --> 0:1:53.231
I know what every single one

23
0:1:53.265 --> 0:1:55.200
of them knives and forks is for.

24
0:1:57.669 --> 0:1:59.671
This is a butter knife.

25
0:1:59.704 --> 0:2:1.005
It's the only one
you need to remember,

26
0:2:1.039 --> 0:2:2.274
the rest of the cutlery is easy.

27
0:2:2.307 --> 0:2:3.409
You start from the outside,

28
0:2:3.442 --> 0:2:5.645
and you work your way in
with each course.

29
0:2:5.678 --> 0:2:8.481
And never let anyone
describe you as "H.K.L.P."...

30
0:2:8.514 --> 0:2:9.648
What's that?

31
0:2:9.680 --> 0:2:11.283
"Holds knife like pen."

32
0:2:11.315 --> 0:2:12.550
A habit erroneously believed

33
0:2:12.583 --> 0:2:14.652
to be upper class
dining etiquette.

34
0:2:14.687 --> 0:2:16.555
It is quite the opposite.

35
0:2:18.858 --> 0:2:23.329
White wine, pudding wine,
red wine, water and pop.

36
0:2:23.361 --> 0:2:25.230
Or whatever tipple
takes your fancy.

37
0:2:27.065 --> 0:2:28.300
Am I supposed to wait
for everyone else

38
0:2:28.333 --> 0:2:29.668
to be served
before I start eating?

39
0:2:29.700 --> 0:2:31.403
HARRY: Only if the dish
being served is cold.

40
0:2:31.437 --> 0:2:34.540
Or if the Queen is present.
Otherwise tuck in.

41
0:2:36.074 --> 0:2:37.442
EGGSY: Got to be honest...

42
0:2:37.476 --> 0:2:39.845
never really thought
the royalty bit would be relevant.

43
0:2:40.813 --> 0:2:42.148
Harry would've been chuffed.

44
0:2:43.482 --> 0:2:45.818
Oh. I wish I could've met him.

45
0:2:51.357 --> 0:2:53.793
You miss him too,
don't you, Mr. Pickle?

46
0:2:55.593 --> 0:2:56.696
Mmm?
