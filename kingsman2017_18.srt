0:0:2.445 --> 0:0:3.514
(CHUCKLES)

2
0:0:3.546 --> 0:0:6.182
And give you another reason
to come back home soon.

3
0:0:6.916 --> 0:0:8.250
I love him.

4
0:0:8.285 --> 0:0:10.387
But I don't need another
reason to come home.

5
0:0:13.057 --> 0:0:14.325
(HORN BLARING)

6
0:0:17.327 --> 0:0:21.198
I apologize.
Just waiting for my friend.

7
0:0:21.231 --> 0:0:23.133
I'll be back as soon
as I can, I promise.

8
0:0:24.867 --> 0:0:26.969
Got to go save the world?
Yep.

9
0:0:27.003 --> 0:0:28.805
Well, if you save the world...

10
0:0:30.006 --> 0:0:31.775
you know what that means.

11
0:0:31.809 --> 0:0:33.444
Yeah, all right.

12
0:0:36.713 --> 0:0:37.715
Bye, buddy.

13
0:0:44.119 --> 0:0:45.655
Got the passes from my contact.

14
0:0:46.523 --> 0:0:48.492
You're gonna love Glastonbury.

15
0:0:49.425 --> 0:0:51.427
Well, that's the easy part, kid.

16
0:0:51.461 --> 0:0:53.564
Take a look in the glove box.

17
0:0:57.934 --> 0:0:59.302
EGGSY: Fucking hell, bruv.

18
0:0:59.336 --> 0:1:1.771
Thought everything
was supposed to be bigger in America.

19
0:1:1.805 --> 0:1:4.207
Is this why you overcompensate
with these massive cars?

20
0:1:4.240 --> 0:1:6.008
Goes on your finger.

21
0:1:6.043 --> 0:1:7.410
The surveillance tracker
is in the tip.

22
0:1:7.443 --> 0:1:10.813
Apply light pressure for three
seconds to release it.

23
0:1:10.847 --> 0:1:11.914
(CROWD CHEERING)

24
0:1:11.948 --> 0:1:13.184
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

25
0:1:16.686 --> 0:1:19.255
EGGSY: Okay, so according
to her Instagram feed...

26
0:1:19.289 --> 0:1:22.258
Charlie's ex-girlfriend
is up ahead at the VIP bar.

27
0:1:22.291 --> 0:1:24.126
Which one of us is gonna
plant the tracker?

28
0:1:24.160 --> 0:1:25.496
Bands, boys.

29
0:1:26.229 --> 0:1:28.265
Yeah, that's fine.

30
0:1:28.298 --> 0:1:31.001
WHISKEY: I say we both
make an approach...

31
0:1:31.034 --> 0:1:32.936
whoever gets on best,
goes for it.

32
0:1:32.970 --> 0:1:34.571
Well, it doesn't have
to be a competition, bruv.

33
0:1:34.604 --> 0:1:35.973
Why don't we just
go up to her...

34
0:1:36.006 --> 0:1:37.274
shake her hand,
pat her on the back,

35
0:1:37.307 --> 0:1:39.443
whatever, you know.
Job done.

36
0:1:39.476 --> 0:1:42.646
The hand is not
a mucous membrane, Eggsy.

37
0:1:42.680 --> 0:1:44.614
Neither is the back.

38
0:1:44.646 --> 0:1:46.448
They teach you anything
at Kingsman?

39
0:1:46.483 --> 0:1:47.918
What are you talking about?

40
0:1:47.950 --> 0:1:50.653
Our trackers are designed
to enter the bloodstream.

41
0:1:50.686 --> 0:1:54.023
They circulate harmlessly,
providing full audio and GPS.

42
0:1:54.057 --> 0:1:55.225
EGGSY: Mucus membrane.

43
0:1:55.258 --> 0:1:56.927
That's like up the nose,
isn't it?

44
0:1:56.959 --> 0:1:58.896
What the fuck am I gonna do?
Stick my finger...

45
0:2:2.765 --> 0:2:4.968
It's not just inside
the nose, is it?

46
0:2:5.001 --> 0:2:8.005
No, Eggsy, it ain't.
Fuck.

47
0:2:8.037 --> 0:2:9.872
All right,
I'll take the first crack.

48
0:2:9.905 --> 0:2:11.608
Watch and learn, buddy.

49
0:2:11.640 --> 0:2:12.843
(SCOFFS)

50
0:2:14.276 --> 0:2:15.679
Good luck.

51
0:2:21.485 --> 0:2:23.385
Here you go, ma'am.
Thank you.

52
0:2:23.418 --> 0:2:24.554
Miss, I beg your pardon.

53
0:2:24.588 --> 0:2:26.856
Now, I don't wanna pester you...

54
0:2:26.889 --> 0:2:28.758
but I just have to know,
what time are you playing?

55
0:2:29.925 --> 0:2:31.561
I'm not in a band.

56
0:2:31.595 --> 0:2:33.062
Oh, God.
Who did you think I was?

57
0:2:33.095 --> 0:2:34.496
Please don't say
someone ghastly.

58
0:2:34.530 --> 0:2:37.200
God damn it,
now I feel like a fool.

59
0:2:37.233 --> 0:2:41.604
I just assumed that a woman
with your charisma...

60
0:2:41.637 --> 0:2:43.773
well, she just had
to be somebody.

61
0:2:43.807 --> 0:2:44.942
Right.

62
0:2:45.608 --> 0:2:46.543
Thank you.

63
0:2:46.575 --> 0:2:48.077
No, it's okay.
I know you didn't mean

64
0:2:48.110 --> 0:2:49.378
to make me feel
like a dumb-ass.

65
0:2:49.412 --> 0:2:50.646
So I'll let you make it up to me

66
0:2:50.680 --> 0:2:52.515
by letting me buy you a drink.

67
0:2:53.182 --> 0:2:54.517
Follow my finger.

68
0:2:59.021 --> 0:3:1.056
(CHUCKLES)
What are we doing?
