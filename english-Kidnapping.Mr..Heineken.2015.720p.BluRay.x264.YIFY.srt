1
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:36,660
So you've decided
to make your own luck.

2
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,230
<i> I can understand that. </i>

3
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,630
I made Heineken
into a world class brand.

4
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,240
Me. On my own.

5
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,940
It's worth billions now.

6
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,840
I did that.

7
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,710
<i> And not by sitting </i>
<i> on my ass either </i>

8
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,140
waiting for the stupid
money fairy

9
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:54,780
to hit me on my stupid
damned head.

10
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,220
<i> You know </i>
<i> that what you're doing </i>
<i> is completely stupid. </i>

11
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,050
Unless, of course,
you pull it off,

12
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,820
in which case it can be
completely brilliant.

13
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,760
Yeah. I suppose
if I were in your shoes,

14
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,960
I would do
exactly the same.

15
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,300
<i> Ah, there he is. </i>

16
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,210
<i> What are you doing? </i>
Huh?

17
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,110
What are
you doing?

18
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,940
You can't bring
a kid to this.

19
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,810
He can wait
outside with Brakes.

20
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,610
This is fucked up.

21
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,920
Listen, it's
not fucked.
It's fine.

22
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,650
Cat, can you put
the kid down, please?

23
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:08,550
Just give him
to my little brother.

24
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,590
Right. Now,
is everyone ready?
Yes.

25
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,790
- Is everyone ready?
-          Yeah!

26
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,910
Alright, let's do this.

27
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,750
<i> Well, it's a pleasure </i>

28
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,880
<i> to finally meet you, </i>
<i> Mr. Iverson. </i>

29
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,890
My name is Cor Van Hout.

30
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,650
This is Mr. Holleeder,
Mr. Boellard, and Mr. Meijer.

31
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,090
<i> We're here today </i>
<i> in the hope </i>

32
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,860
<i> of asking you </i>
<i> for a loan. </i>

33
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,160
- A loan?
<i>-  Yeah. </i>

34
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,260
It's a business loan.

35
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,200
<i> And what particular </i>
<i> sort of--? </i>
Construction.

36
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,860
<i> Yeah, we </i>
<i> were doing well. </i>

37
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,000
<i> Yeah, really well. </i>

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,640
You've been running
a company employing
a hundred men?

39
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,300
Yeah, well, we were
all equal partners,

40
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,110
yeah, right down
the middle there.

41
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,240
Um, Mr. Boellard here
is a master carpenter.

42
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,780
Mr. Meijer has a--

43
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,380
If these numbers
are real,

44
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,910
you're in
fine shape.

45
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,080
<i> Surely, if </i>
<i> you've been making </i>
<i> this kind of money, </i>

46
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,850
you must
have investments

47
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,950
that you could stake
as collateral?

48
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,990
<i> Uh, well, we had, uh, </i>

49
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:18,090
you know, cars,
and we had boats

50
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,030
and we had
some race horses but--

51
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,960
<i> Equities, bonds, </i>
<i> pension funds? </i>

52
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,900
When the recession hit,
we cashed in.

53
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,370
<i> The cars, </i>
<i> the boats, </i>
<i> the horses? </i>

54
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,300
It's for paychecks, uh,

55
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,800
for guys living
from one Friday
to the next.

56
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,640
I think
you can understand

57
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,780
that their kids
can't live or eat off IOUs.

58
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,310
I think, maybe,
what you haven't heard,

59
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:42,110
Mr. Big Manager,
is that, uh,

60
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,750
there's a world
of hurt out there
right now--

61
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:49,960
Oh, believe me,
I know.

62
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,760
Well, we still got
a building.

63
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,290
Great.
What's the address?

64
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,900
Uh, it's Leidsegracht.

65
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,230
<i> Six six three. </i>

66
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:59,400
Hold on.
Leidsegracht?

67
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,800
The commune?

68
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,870
Commune?
It's a bunch of punks
that don't pay their rent.

69
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,200
It's hardly
a fucking commune.

70
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,110
Yes.
Squatters.

71
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,180
<i> We're in the process </i>
<i> of evictions. </i>

72
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,780
<i> Government says </i>
<i> once they change </i>
<i> the locks, </i>

73
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,310
they've got rights.
So that means lawyers.

74
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,950
I do see your problem.

75
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,250
But you're
welcome back
when you solve it.

76
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,960
<i> Guys like him </i>

77
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,060
don't lend money
to guys like us.

78
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,390
<i> We'll get the punks </i>
<i> out of the building. </i>

79
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,390
Yeah.
How are you
going to do that?

80
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,130
<i> Yeah. I got </i>
<i> an idea. </i>

81
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,730
Alright, listen.
You're going
to love this.

82
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,040
It's time to go, boys!

83
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,240
Hey, what's going on?

84
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,040
Time to go!

85
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,480
Open up!

86
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,750
<i> Cat, get in through a window, </i>
<i> not the front door! </i>

87
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,150
<i> Open up! </i>

88
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:52,950
<i> Come on down! </i>

89
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,020
You don't       scare me!
You fucking stink!

90
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,300
Whoa!

91
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,470
I'll come back
for you.

92
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:09,270
Get the fuck out!

93
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,200
Coming!

94
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,840
Fucking coming!

95
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:33,190
- Oh, shit!
-            Get out of here!

96
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,100
Shit.

97
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,270
Oh, shit!
Oh!

98
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,110
<i> Get the fuck </i>
<i> out of here. </i>

99
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,480
Oh, shit.

100
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,560
You going
to go?

101
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,320
Go and get
the fuck out of here!

102
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,490
- Get the fuck out!
- Go on!

103
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,400
Now you're in trouble!

104
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,870
Go! Go!
Everyone out!

105
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:17,840
Go, go, go!

106
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,210
Hey, this is
our building!

107
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:21,140
We own this place!

108
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:24,110
<i> Fuckface! </i>

109
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,080
Police! Police!

110
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,280
Everybody go!

111
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,950
You want
to do this?

112
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:32,990
No.
No, I think
I'll pass.

113
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,020
Pussy.

114
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,260
Hey!
Whoaaa!

115
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,130
<i> Charge! </i>

116
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,000
<i> Get your fucking hands </i>
<i> off of me now. </i>

117
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,910
<i> I hope--well, fuck it. </i>
<i> Yeah, yeah. Okay. </i>

118
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,980
Fine. Thank you.
Bye.

119
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,150
What'd he say?

120
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,310
<i> Well, he said </i>
<i> if we lived in Texas, </i>

121
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,080
they'd throw us a parade.

122
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,580
But here,
well you know
how that is.

123
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,890
Yeah.
<i> Anyway, good news. </i>

124
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,520
Squatters aren't going
to press charges.

125
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,520
How kind
is that?
Whooptiedoo.

126
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,420
- Happy days.
<i>-  Cornelius Van Hout. </i>

127
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,490
Yo.

128
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,160
Thank you.

129
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,630
- Only Van Hout.
- Huh?

130
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,440
Hey.

131
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,400
Bad news. You guys
resisted arrest.

132
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,970
Plus, not only do they
get to stay in the building,

133
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,470
<i> we got to pay </i>
<i> for the shit we busted. </i>

134
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,210
Yeah, including
the fish!

135
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,080
Fuck the fish.

136
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,460
Sonja?

137
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,900
Hey.

138
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,400
Uh-oh.

139
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,030
No, no, no.
Listen. I can explain.

140
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,000
I--Sonja,
please, will--Son--!

141
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,240
Sonja, what
are you doing?

142
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,640
You alright?

143
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,450
What's going on, Son?

144
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,590
<i> What are you doing? </i>

145
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:16,360
What are you doing
hiding in my kitchen?

146
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,120
Hey, who are you?

147
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,690
Who are you, huh?

148
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know who you are.

149
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,500
I just worked it out.

150
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,970
<i> Yeah, that's right. </i>
<i> You know what? </i>

151
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:28,930
<i> You are way </i>
<i> too good-looking </i>
<i> to be Karin's boy. Hm? </i>

152
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,370
Oh, hey, Karin, hey.

153
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,370
Hey, how you doing?
I was just joking--

154
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:35,240
If you had any idea
what's been going
on with Sonja,

155
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,180
then you wouldn't do
as you do.

156
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,350
<i> What do you mean </i>
<i> "going on"? </i>

157
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,150
Sonja, please, wh--
what's going on?

158
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,420
I'm pregnant.

159
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:54,160
Ah. Ah.
What?

160
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,600
Ha.
Wow.

161
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,100
That's, uh--

162
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,230
Really?
That's unbelievable.

163
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,240
You're fucking pregnant?
Yeah.

164
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,640
I'll leave you two
to it then.
Bye!

165
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,070
See you, Karin!
Hey, come on, you!

166
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,440
<i> Happy New Year! </i>

167
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,580
Hey!
Hey, Ma!

168
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,510
Look at your hair
and your dress,

169
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,980
<i> you look </i>
<i> like a model. </i>
<i> Thanks. </i>

<i> Hey, be careful! </i>

171
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,520
Yeah, your sister's
knocked up.

172
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,360
Yeah, I know
It's great.

173
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,260
He doesn't greet
his old man--

174
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,490
or even have
a beer with him.

175
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,660
You know
I don't drink.

176
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,200
<i> Especially Heineken. </i>
Look at me
when you talk to me.

177
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,740
<i> Heineken beer </i>
<i> and Heineken money </i>

178
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,740
paid for this house
and for your upbringing.

179
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,580
You see that?

180
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,750
The man
is my friend.

181
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,620
But he fired you
and I don't think
he remembers your name.

182
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,370
You owe him respect.

183
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:12,070
- Okay, let's go.
-                        <i> Oh! </i>

184
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,570
<i> Yeah. </i>
<i> Yeah, yeah, yeah. </i>

185
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:16,610
Bye, honey.
Happy New Year.
Bye, Mom.
Bye.

186
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:19,710
Bye.
Take care of her.
Thank you.
Alright. Thank you.

187
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:22,110
Invite him round
next time, Pa.

188
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,550
We'll all
kiss his ring.

189
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,730
Well, that was festive.

190
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,630
Oh, come on.
Let's have some fun.

191
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,230
Let's go to Karin's.

192
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:40,700
Aw, come on, Sonja.

193
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,370
You know
what we got to do.

194
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:43,800
Hey? Come on.

195
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,600
I'll look
after him.
Come on.

196
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,840
Come on.
It's tradition, alright?

197
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,210
Yeah, go.
You don't mind?

198
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:50,840
No!
No?

199
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,150
Alright,
I love you.
Love you, too.

200
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,280
Go!
Have fun!

201
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:04,090
Here's to making
this year count.

202
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:07,360
Alright, to getting
our old lives back.

203
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,790
<i> Yeah, some fucking </i>
<i> New Year. </i>

204
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,500
We've no money,
the company's bankrupt,

205
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,700
and no one's going
to give us a loan.

206
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,300
So how are we going
to get our old lives
back? Huh?

207
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,270
We could get jobs.

208
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,510
<i> Yeah, that's the </i>
<i> alcohol talking. </i>
Ha.

209
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,540
I'm not getting
a real job.

210
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,310
No, I'm not going
to bust my ass
every single day

211
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:26,380
to go
absolutely nowhere.

212
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:32,280
<i> I think this year </i>
<i> I refuse to be miserable. </i>

213
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,450
Actually, that's, uh--

214
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,390
that's why I want
to talk to you guys
about some business.

215
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:38,260
Cor, we just
got out of jail.

216
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,590
I'm not talking
about that kind
of business.

217
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,560
I'm talking about
smart business.

218
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,860
So what type
of business
you planning?

219
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,830
<i> I'm planning </i>
<i> something organized, </i>

220
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:49,570
something big.

221
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,900
How big?

222
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:54,510
Big enough that we
never have to grovel

223
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:56,310
to another
asshole banker again.

224
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,910
Yeah, right, man.

225
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,340
<i> We betting? </i>

226
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,780
Or we talking
about a crime?

227
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:04,620
That's all crime is.
It's a wager.

228
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,790
<i> Right? </i>
<i> Think about it. </i>

229
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:10,420
You bet your liberty
against the payoff.

230
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:14,490
All I have to bet,
all I have left...
is my liberty.

231
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,500
And that's all
you guys have.

232
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,700
<i> That's all you've </i>
<i> got left to bet. </i>

233
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,400
<i> So if you're going </i>
<i> to bet that, </i>

234
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,770
I guess you're going
to have to bet it big.

235
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:24,840
How big?

236
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,210
Sixty million.

237
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,450
Shit.
Sixty?

238
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:36,850
Who are you
going to kidnap?

239
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,480
<i> Kidnap? </i>
<i> Come on, man. </i>

240
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:40,750
Shit.
Man, I thought
you were serious.

241
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,290
Idiot.
You're an idiot.

242
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:44,420
He's serious.
I'm serious.

243
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,820
He's been talking
about this since we
were fucking kids!

244
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:48,790
Grabbing anybody
is easy.

245
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,860
Collecting the ransom
and getting away with it
is impossible.

246
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:54,900
<i> It's not. </i>
<i> It's not impossible. </i>

247
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,970
Who do you
want to kidnap?

248
00:12:55,970 --> 00:13:00,540
Got to be a local.

249
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,710
It's got
to be a guy.

250
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:05,740
I'm not messing
with women
or children, eh.

251
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,310
He's got to be
stinking fucking rich.

252
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:14,420
You're out
of your fucking mind.

253
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,630
<i> It's like I said-- </i>

254
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,970
<i> let's make </i>
<i> this year </i>
<i> count, huh? </i>

255
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:29,600
Woo!

256
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,970
Happy fucking
New Year!

257
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,880
Hi, there.

258
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:48,620
<i> Guys, look </i>
<i> what I've got. Huh? </i>

259
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,360
Cat, this is
specially for you.

260
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,420
Oh.
Wow.

261
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,430
What is this?

262
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:56,860
Who do I
look like?

263
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,260
What do you think?

264
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,270
<i> I don't know </i>
<i> if I love these </i>
<i> or hate these. </i>

265
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,730
They're scary, eh?

266
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,570
<i> I look like Willem. </i>

267
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:04,600
<i> No, you look </i>
<i> like a fucking pervert. </i>

268
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,970
Where's Willem anyway?

269
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:09,340
I'm not wearing a wig.

270
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,510
<i> We got to find </i>
<i> a place so we </i>
<i> can hide him </i>

271
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,610
where no one's
going to look.

272
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:14,710
My workshed
would be perfect

273
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,320
but there's an office
full of bean counters
next door.

274
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,480
Guys, we can't just
dump him in the shed.

275
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:22,720
No. But we could
build a room
inside the shed.

276
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,060
<i> That's good. </i>
It's perfect.

277
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,430
I found
a boat we can steal.

278
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:30,430
<i> It's fucking fast. </i>
<i> Was a boat </i>
<i> on the list? </i>

279
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:33,300
No.
<i> So why are we </i>
<i> talking about a boat? </i>

280
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,470
I'm trying to think
outside the box.
Come on.

281
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:37,700
Yeah, well, don't.

282
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,840
Whoa.

283
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,340
<i> Guns are on that list. </i>
<i> Right? </i>

284
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,440
Okay.
Yes.

285
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,910
<i> Now be careful </i>
<i> with that, please. </i>

286
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:48,410
World War II?
Safety's a little
edgy on that!

287
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,890
Fuck, Spikes!

288
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:54,890
<i> Man-- </i>

289
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,620
Shhh.
What?

290
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,860
Hear that?

291
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:58,960
Shit.

292
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,670
We're good?
We're good?
We're good?
Yeah.

293
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,530
Here I go.

294
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,700
What the fuck?

295
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,740
<i> - It's okay. </i>
-         What was that?

296
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:16,540
<i> Yeah, it was just </i>
<i> fucking Rambo </i>
<i> over here. </i>

297
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,540
Listen, man.
Where have you been?

298
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:23,880
I've been thinking
about how we
grab Heiny.

299
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,020
<i> We've been trying </i>
<i> to come up with </i>
<i> some ideas, too. </i>

300
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,520
<i> What you got? </i>

301
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,060
<i> If we're </i>
<i> going to do this, </i>
<i> we have to make sure </i>

302
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,790
that the cops look
in the wrong direction.

303
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:36,060
<i> That they have to believe </i>
<i> that whoever took Heiny </i>

304
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,660
<i> he's, like, some </i>
<i> big swinging dick, </i>

305
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:43,840
like--Baader Meinhof?
Or Red Brigades?
Mafia?

306
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,670
And those fuckers
they don't mess
around. Yeah?

307
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,040
For a job like this,
they would have

308
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,610
military grade
weapons, radios.

309
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:53,080
They would have
a safehouse
to hold him.

310
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,680
<i> They would have months </i>
<i> of preparation, months </i>
<i> of observation. </i>

311
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,880
They would spend
at least a hundred grand.

312
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:01,120
Same old story, man?

313
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,490
Want to get rich?

314
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:05,920
You got to be
rich already.
Yeah.

315
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:09,160
If you want to do this
on a shoestring, fine.

316
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,830
But the cops are going
to look for a bunch
of local jerkoffs

317
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:16,000
and they're going
to nail us fucking flat.

318
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,070
Oh, fuck it.

319
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,970
<i> Let's pay another visit </i>
<i> to the bank. </i>

320
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:28,910
<i>shoot </i>
<i> at the ground. </i>

321
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,050
We know.

322
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,590
Okay, guys.
Let's go.

323
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,760
Now!

324
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,830
On the ground! Now!

325
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:56,170
Go, go, go!

326
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,440
Come on!

327
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,550
Go! Go!

328
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,820
Put your gun down!

329
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,030
Sorry!

330
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,530
Look out!

331
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:21,870
He's gone
to the next canal!

332
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:23,700
That's it!

333
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,510
<i> Cat! Get ready </i>
<i> to cut the rope! </i>

334
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,050
Go, go!
I'll cover you!

335
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:53,130
Come on!
Hurry up!

336
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:01,770
Come on!

337
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,940
Shoot at the ground!
Shoot at the ground!

338
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,280
Get down!

339
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,120
Shit!

340
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:34,610
Get out of the way!
Look out!

341
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,910
Hoo!
Woo-hoo!

342
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,680
You sure it's clear?
Yeah, yeah.

343
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,900
Yeah, Cor.

344
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:43,640
Wow.

345
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,910
Now who's big
swinging dicks?

346
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,810
Alright, it's time
to get down to business.

347
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:57,160
<i> How was your day? </i>

348
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,360
<i> Yeah, it was fine. </i>
<i> It was good. </i>

349
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:04,160
Somebody robbed
a bank.

350
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,830
Yeah, I know.
I heard that.

351
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:11,000
With machine guns,
like, Al Capone.

352
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Wowww.
They shot
hundreds of bullets.

353
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:14,870
Hardly.
I don't think so.

354
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,710
It was all
over the radio.

355
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:18,740
And the TV.

356
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:22,410
Where have you been?

357
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:25,680
With Cat.
I was helping him
with his boat.

358
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:27,420
Where?
What do you
mean "where"?

359
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:32,760
At the, um, marina.
Up in Newlake.

360
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,390
Does he ever pay
you for stuff
like that?

361
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,730
Yeah. Yeah,
he does.

362
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,900
Mm.

363
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,900
Okay, okay.
Nice.

364
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,950
Amazing thing
about that robbery.

365
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,680
Mmm.

366
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,120
All that gunfire.

367
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,250
They didn't hit anyone.

368
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:06,830
Yeah?

369
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:09,230
Yeah, really.

370
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,400
Yeah, that's good.

371
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,460
Mm.

372
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,160
Thank you.

373
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,640
I've been waiting
for you, Obi-Wan.

374
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,970
That's good, right?

375
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,440
I'm going
to take that.

376
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,480
How much
do I owe you?

377
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:05,520
Hmm.
I'm going
to need a couple.

378
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,050
May I ask
you something?

379
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,920
You're not from
around here.

380
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,490
<i> No, I'm just, uh, </i>
<i> passing through. </i>

381
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:16,160
<i> Here's my private </i>
<i> telephone number. </i>

382
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,230
<i> I can show </i>
<i> you around. </i>

383
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,400
<i> I weighed it. </i>

384
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,970
<i> Thirty five million </i>
<i> is all we can carry. </i>

385
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,010
<i> Maybe the wood blocks </i>
<i> that were heavier </i>
<i> than the money. </i>

386
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:36,210
It'll all have to be
small denominations.

387
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,550
Yeah, and
different currencies.
I've carried
twice as much.

388
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,450
Oh, aren't you one?

389
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:41,090
I already picked
out my Ferrari.
A Ferrari?

390
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:43,120
Yeah!
You couldn't handle
a Ferrari.

391
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,360
You can
barely handle
a scooter.
Fuck you, man.

392
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,890
You want a Ferrari
because you got
a small dick.

393
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:48,230
Fuck you, man.

394
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:06,510
Ahhh!

395
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,390
<i> Ahhh! </i>

396
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,890
I didn't hear anything.

397
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:21,130
Yeah, well.

398
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:24,360
I'm surprised.

399
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,470
Well.
Yeah.

400
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:28,870
We have to test
these as well.

401
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,870
Cat?
Oh.

402
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,540
<i> Cat?! </i>

403
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,660
Where is everything?

404
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,490
What happened
to the cells?

405
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:28,390
What's going on?

406
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,130
What--?
What's going on?

407
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:33,630
<i> Where is everything? </i>

408
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:35,500
<i> I want you to think </i>
<i> of the Anne Frank house. </i>

409
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,370
<i> Oh, yeah. </i>
<i> Anne Frank! </i>

410
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:42,210
Fucking brilliant.

411
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,280
You're a genius.

412
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,480
Come again.
You're a fucking genius.

413
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,020
Where's the door?

414
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:54,990
Ask and you
shall receive.

415
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:57,260
We did do
a door, right?

416
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,960
Ah, good job.

417
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,460
"Respond to our
ransom demand

418
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:08,230

419
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,400

00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:16,410

422
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,150
<i> Okay. </i>

423
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:22,450
<i> Take it. </i>

424
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:45,670
Can you fucking
stop that?

425
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,510
Okay, it's time.

426
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,020
Shit.

427
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,120
No, it's nothing.

428
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:41,230
You don't
know that.
Look, it's nothing.

429
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:43,190
It's just
a coincidence.

430
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,800
There's always an excuse
if you're looking for it.

431
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,230
If we're
going to do this,
we do it now.

432
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,240
<i> Here we go. </i>

433
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:04,450
Alright, let's go.

434
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:05,620
Let's go.

435
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:15,460
Now remember,
if we need to speak,

436
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:18,060
then we only speak
in German.

437
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,280
Lovely evening.

438
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,580
We'll be in touch.

439
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,860
<i> Alright. </i>

440
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:52,200
Huh? Hands off.
What are you doing?

441
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:57,470
Who are you?

442
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:03,110
Let me go!
Let me go!

443
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,820
Dumb shit!
Get into the fucking van!

444
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,770
<i> What? </i>

445
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:54,720
Alright, alright, alright.

446
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,260
Ahhh!

447
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:09,530
Ahhh.

448
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,700
Okay.

449
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,470
<i> Ohhh! </i>

450
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:16,470
<i> Alright, okay, okay, okay. </i>

451
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:21,680
Alright, let me have
all their clothes.

452
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,350
Come on.
That's nice.
I'll get the barrel.

453
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,290
Hey, can we talk now?

454
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:30,020
I told you to speak
in German!

455
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,420
Your man
didn't fight
like mine.

456
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,690
Shhh.
Enough!

457
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,970
<i> Alright, listen. </i>

458
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:48,570
Did anybody
leave their fingerprints
on this ransom note?

459
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,880
Huh? I'll ask again.

460
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:56,580
Did anybody touch this
with their bare hands?

461
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:59,580
I may have.
Oh, fuck.

462
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:02,320
Alright. Is there
anybody next door?

463
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,520
They should have
left by now.

464
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,020
Come with me.
Come on.

465
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:07,860
Let's start.
Willem, where do I start?

466
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:30,050
Here.

467
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:37,520
The copier is there.

468
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:56,570
Let's go,
let's go.

469
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,980
It's okay.
We got a new one.

470
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,420
You got his watch?

471
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:17,360
Alright.
Now remember,

472
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,930
once you're done
with that,

473
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:20,460
you make out
like it's any
other night.

474
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:22,600
Mm-hm.
We'll be
at the bar.

475
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,440
I'll be there.
It's our alibi.

476
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,870
Hey, kid.
You good?

477
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:28,640
Yeah?
You sure?

478
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,710
Alright, good.

479
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:37,580
<i> Just don't think </i>
<i> about it </i>

480
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:40,450
<i> being a police </i>
<i> station, alright? </i>

481
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:44,060
Ever think you'd deliver
an invoice for 35 million?

482
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,090
Are they really
going to pay
all that?

483
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:47,160
They have to.

484
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,430
Can't we just mail it?

485
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,630
Come on.

486
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,070
Take a breath.

487
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:03,170
- Breathe.
-                        Go.

488
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:22,830
It's not exactly
my favorite
neighborhood either.

489
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,580
Package is
delivered, boys.
You good?

490
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:45,080
We're heading home.
Cat, Cat, Cat.
Stay for one minute.

491
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,220
Come on,
stay for one.

492
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,090
Yeah, one drink,
one drink.

493
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:52,860
You alright?

494
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:55,060
Do it.

495
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,790
Ring the bell!

496
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,130
Ring it!

497
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:20,820
You guys do it up
right last night?

498
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,590
Well, you know me.

499
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:23,890
We made sure
we were seen

500
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:25,060
and we kept
it respectable.

501
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,860
Good.
You?

502
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,790
Oh, it was riveting.

503
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,860
I fell asleep
watching cartoons
with the kids.

504
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,100
Yeah.

505
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:42,670
Well?
How are they?

506
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,080
Heineken's fine.
Pissed off.

507
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:49,710
The driver
is not too good.

508
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,580
<i> Now you </i>
<i> listen to me. </i>

509
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,580
<i> You are in </i>
<i> no danger here. </i>

510
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:28,820
Anhh.
As long
<i> as the money is paid, </i>
<i> you will be released. </i>

511
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,990
Anhh.
<i> Do you understand? </i>

512
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:39,300
Hey, guys.

513
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,760
Check it out.

514
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:23,070
Do you have
a name?

515
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,710
<i> No name. </i>

516
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:26,340
Is it ransom
or money?

517
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,150
Are you the boss?

518
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:35,350
<i> Okay, you're the boss. </i>

519
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:38,760
<i> So, I have </i>
<i> a few requests. </i>

520
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:42,990
I'd like
a bathrobe, slippers,

521
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,100
a shaving kit,
comb, mirror,

522
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:49,970
um, reading glasses,

523
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:53,800
a decent
fucking chair--

524
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:55,670
and, um, what else?

525
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,040
Oh, yes, and if it's
not too much trouble,

526
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,110
a telephone.

527
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:05,120
<i> You have </i>
<i> no name, huh? </i>

528
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:08,420
You're part
of an organization?

529
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,250
You're Baader Meinhof?

530
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,920
Red Brigade?

531
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,430
<i> IRA? </i>
<i> Symbionese Army? </i>

532
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:22,230
<i> - Hey, Cor. </i>
-         <i> What? </i>

533
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,870
Look at this.
What?

534
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:26,440
Oh, fuck.

535
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,670
You're going
to love it.
Oh, nice.

536
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:29,340
Mm-hm.
Nice, nice.

537
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,010
Says five guys involved.
How many have you?

538
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:33,040
This one says three.

539
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:35,410
<i> Yeah, listen to this. </i>

540
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:40,120
"An unknown number
of most certainly dangerous
and experienced criminals."

541
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,220
Let me see,
let me see.

542
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,750
It's perfect.

543
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,720
<i> More about this </i>
<i> morning's top story-- </i>

544
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:48,030
<i> Alfred Heineken, </i>
<i> the billionaire </i>
<i> of brewing, </i>

545
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:50,360
<i> was kidnapped by a group </i>
<i> of heavily armed </i>
<i> men yesterday-- </i>

546
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,030
I know
who did it.

547
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:54,470
<i> ...corporate in Amsterdam, </i>

548
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:56,130
<i> Police have </i>
<i> now confirmed </i>
<i> that they-- </i>

549
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:59,040
Who?
Bud.

550
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,010
Weiser.
Bud Weiser.

551
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:02,970
<i> Yeah? </i>

552
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:05,240
<i> One way to beat </i>
<i> the competition, huh? </i>

553
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:08,750
Funny guy, huh?

554
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:11,880
<i> Police would not disclose </i>
<i> the size of the ransom </i>
<i> demanded </i>

555
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,920
<i> but it is assumed </i>
<i> to be significant. </i>

556
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,820
<i> What? </i>

557
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,390
The ransom note.
<i> What? </i>

558
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:21,090
The ransom note.
<i> What do you mean? </i>

559
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:23,460
Did we leave it?
In the copier?
No, no.

560
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:26,000
<i> ...chased, until </i>
<i> he was threatened </i>
<i> by the kidnappers </i>

561
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,260
<i> with a machine gun. </i>

562
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:28,800
Wait, did we--?

563
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,870
<i> No, did we? </i>

564
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,910
Oh, fuck.

565
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,530
<i> Hey, uh-- </i>

566
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:58,330
George.
George, yeah.

567
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:00,030
Remember me?
Yeah.

568
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:02,170
How's it going?
Same old, same old.

569
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:04,770
So everything's alright?
I guess.

570
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:06,270
Do you mind
if we make
a quick copy?

571
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:08,440
Go ahead.
Thank you.

572
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,540
Thank you.

573
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,510
Thank you.

574
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:52,980
Thank you
for that, too.

575
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:57,090
I assume you, uh,
sent a note about
the ransom.

576
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:59,190
<i> Did they reply? </i>

577
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:01,430
<i> Well, they will. </i>

578
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:08,530
In the meantime,

579
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:11,600
this music,
it's beautiful and laden
with tragic disillusion

580
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:15,570
but, uh, the same tape
over and over again,
all day long,

581
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:17,880
please, I know
I am your prisoner

582
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,340
but there's no need
to torture me,
my friend.

583
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:25,350
Some Johann Sebastian Bach
would be quite soothing.
Or, well--

584
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:29,850
Franz Fucking
Schubert, anything.
Silence, preferably.

585
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:32,390
Also, some books
would pass the time

586
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:36,190
and as much as I
adore ham sandwiches,
my friend,

587
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:40,360
Chinese food is
quite easy to get,
and it's cheap too,

588
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:43,570
and, uh, I know,
something like, um,

589
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:45,640
yeah, Bang Bang chicken.

590
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:49,110
With some
extra chili sauce,
how about that? Okay?

591
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:59,380
<i> - Happy birthday. </i>
<i>-  Cheers. </i>

592
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:02,150
<i> You'll be looking for </i>
<i> a regular paycheck now, hey. </i>

593
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,920
<i> Ah, finally. </i>

594
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,190
<i> I can serve </i>
<i> the cake now. </i>

595
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:07,120
Hi, honey.

596
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:10,030
No more
fooling around, huh?

597
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:12,460
<i> - My son Mark, </i>        <i> he drives a tram.
-  </i> Yeah, I know Mark.

598
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,530
<i> Yeah, he's got </i>
<i> good hours. </i>

599
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:17,670
Most importantly,
he's got a good pension.
<i> Uh-huh. </i>

600
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:19,900
<i> You'd have to take </i>
<i> the training first. </i>

601
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:22,110
<i> Really? They train? </i>

602
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,270
<i> I could have </i>
<i> a word with him-- </i>
Yeah, could you?

603
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:27,640
Always the same
stupid joke.

604
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,380
<i> From my daughter </i>
<i> as well, now? </i>

605
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,320
Wonderful.

606
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,380
What a kind and
thoughtful gift,
thank you.

607
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:36,090
Pa, it was a joke.

608
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:41,590
Cannot you at least
wait till they let
Mr. Heineken go, huh?

609
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:43,290
<i> If they ever do </i>
<i> let him go. </i>

610
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,160
<i> Don't start </i>
<i> on this again. </i>

611
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,500
If I get
those filthy bastards,
I will kill them.

612
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,930
We know.
We know.
Kill them!

613
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:51,000
<i> Willem, please, </i>
<i> it's Pa's birthday. </i>
<i> Come on. </i>

614
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:00,980
<i> Cat? </i>

615
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:05,020
<i> How long do you reckon it'll </i>
<i> take Heineken's people </i>
<i> to pay the ransom? </i>

616
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,480
Cat. How long
do you reckon it'll--?

617
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:09,220
No more questions.

618
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:11,560
Because I
don't have
the answers.

619
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,000
<i> Aw, thanks. </i>

620
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,530
Hey, and thanks
for the new music.

621
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,970
It's very whimsical,
very droll. Yeah.

622
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:27,400
Got books!
Good.

623
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:29,970
Alright.

624
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:32,510
Any luck
with the Bang Bang?

625
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:34,280
<i> Huh? </i>

626
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,350
No?

627
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:45,020
<i> Some guys like </i>
<i> Bang Bang chili all the time. </i>

628
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,660
But you like
sweet sour.

629
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:48,490
Ever since five years.

630
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:51,260
Sweet sour pork,
sweet sour prawn,

631
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:53,230
sweet sour beef.
You're a sweet sour guy.

632
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:55,200
<i> So it's </i>
<i> Chinese, right? </i>

633
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,330
Now me
is a chili guy.
Okay, okay.

634
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:59,670
You a goddamn
Bang Bang man.

635
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,410
Right.
See you tomorrow.

636
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:07,110
<i> What can I </i>
<i> get for you? </i>

637
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:09,310
Ah!

638
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,750
<i> Wake up. </i>

639
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:15,020
Fuck you, man.

640
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:17,490
Did they run
the notice?
Not yet.

641
00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:20,590
Come on, man,
this was only supposed
to take five days.

642
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:22,530
What if he is sick?

643
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:24,290
We gotta kidnap
a fucking doctor?
Is he sick?

644
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:26,530
No.

645
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:28,130
Don't get
too personal.

646
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:30,070
Or he'll get
inside your head.

647
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:44,480
Look, leather jacket,
Popeye.

648
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,750
Cops?

649
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:03,670
<i> Willem, even if </i>
<i> they are cops, </i>

650
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:05,700
<i> it doesn't mean anything. </i>

651
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,270
You okay?

652
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:09,340
Fuck, I'm just
done waiting.

653
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:10,710
Yeah, I know.

654
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:11,780
I know.
Alright?
Me, too.

655
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:26,220
What are you
trying to do?

656
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:28,260
Huh?

657
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,460
Uh-huh.

658
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:32,260
Yeah.

659
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:33,860
Mm-hm.

660
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:35,670
If you tell
the Police where I am,

661
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:37,570
I could give you
half the ransom
and, uh,

662
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:39,200
a house
in Switzerland.

663
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,170
Lots of beautiful
Swiss girls,

664
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:43,410
blond, they're beautiful.

665
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:46,510
I'll--

666
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:50,210
I'll arrange it
as many as you like.

667
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:52,520
No?
You're not interested?

668
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:55,220
Are you gay
or something? Huh?

669
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:59,660
Any news
from the Police?

670
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:02,490
Oh.

671
00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:11,840
<i> It's been over </i>
<i> two weeks now. </i>

672
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,800
<i> The longer </i>
<i> they don't pay the money, </i>

673
00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:14,870
<i> the more time they have </i>
<i> to figure out who did it. </i>

674
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:19,410
You want to give up?

675
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:21,580
<i> I do. </i>

676
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:23,580
<i> You what? </i>

677
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:26,250
I do, yeah.

678
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:28,750
<i> Let's let him go. </i>

679
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:30,750
Knock down the cells,

680
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:33,490
burn everything.

681
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:37,160
<i> Okay, we don't get </i>
<i> the money, </i>

682
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:39,260
but you know
what we do get?

683
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:41,600
Our lives back.
<i> Oh, come on. </i>

684
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,800
Come on, look,
they're just
messing with us.

685
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,770
<i> That's all that is. </i>

686
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:47,800
<i> Cat, where you going? </i>

687
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:49,540
Uh--Really?
Cat--

688
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:51,810
<i> Wait! </i>
We failed!

689
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:53,810
It's my fucking shed.
I want him out of there.

690
00:45:53,810 --> 00:45:55,610
Before it's too late.

691
00:45:55,610 --> 00:45:57,480
<i> Look, just listen! </i>
<i> Just listen. </i>

692
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,180
Listen, listen, alright?

693
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:01,250
Look, it's all
just part of the game.

694
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:03,520
<i> We're still </i>
<i> in control here. </i>

695
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,320
<i> You really want </i>
<i> to walk out-- </i>

696
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:09,560
on 35 million?
Huh?

697
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:13,560
What we got to do
is make the transaction.

698
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:15,270
Thirty-five million.

699
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:22,310
Someone has got
to relieve Brakes.

700
00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:25,380
Alright.

701
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:26,680
I'm going home.

702
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:02,450
They didn't pay.

703
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:05,020
You've got to be
kidding me.

704
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:08,250
What do you mean
they didn't pay?

705
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:10,820
Last night
was the deadline.

706
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:13,390
<i> We told them </i>
<i> that we would kill you </i>

707
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:14,890
<i> if they didn't pay. </i>

708
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:16,660
And they didn't
fucking pay!

709
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:19,900
So time's up!
Okay.

710
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:23,730
There must be
some confusion.

711
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:27,700
<i> It's confusion, </i>
<i> that's it. </i>

712
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:30,970
Damn, I'm their boss!
Nobody else.

713
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:32,640
Must be out
of their fucking minds.

714
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:33,980
I'll fire them all!

715
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:35,750
Give me a pen
and paper.

716
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:37,350
<i> Give me a pen </i>
<i> and paper now! </i>

717
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:39,420
And you're all fired!
You as well.

718
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:41,020
<i> Don't worry, </i>
<i> you'll get </i>
<i> your blood money. </i>

719
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:42,350
You know you will.
You have my word
of honor.

720
00:47:42,350 --> 00:47:44,550
Okay? Okay?!

721
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,390
<i> You fucking morons! </i>

722
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:48,860
Yeah.
What's his problem?

723
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:50,430
What?

724
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:51,830
Now you
listen to me.

725
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:54,460
<i>Can we also have your-- </i>

726
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:56,070
Ooh.

727
00:47:56,070 --> 00:47:58,640
Can we also have
your word of honor

728
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,540
right now, in writing,

729
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:05,010
that when you're free,
you won't help the police
in any way?

730
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:07,980
<i> My word of honor? </i>
Yeah.

731
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:13,420
Yeah. That's the way
the game is played.

732
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:15,890
<i> You've got </i>
<i> my word. </i>

733
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:17,350
<i> It's time to end </i>
<i> it now, okay? </i>

734
00:48:48,090 --> 00:48:49,420
<i> Hello? </i>

735
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:54,790
<i> W--why is the door open? </i>
<i> Hello? </i>

736
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:59,030
<i> Ab, is that you? </i>

737
00:48:59,030 --> 00:49:01,400
Boss?
<i> Yeah. </i>

738
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:02,570
Boss, are
you alright?
<i> Yeah, I'm sort </i>
<i> of okay. </i>

739
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:04,800
Tired of this crap.

740
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,640
Oh, God.
Um--

741
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:10,440
Are you okay?
Have they left you alone
or given you a rough time?

742
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,610
I don't know,
I--I--I--

743
00:49:12,610 --> 00:49:14,880
How long have we
been in here now?

744
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,810
<i> A month? </i>
<i> I don't know, </i>
<i> I've lost track. </i>

745
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:19,050
<i> I'm a little confused, </i>
<i> it feels longer. </i>

746
00:49:19,050 --> 00:49:20,780
<i> Now, now, </i>
<i> I'll tell you now. </i>

747
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:24,920
<i> It comes to-- </i>

748
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,020
<i> oh, almost </i>
<i> three weeks. </i>

749
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:29,990
Yeah.

750
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,830
Why the hell
are you here?

751
00:49:31,830 --> 00:49:34,000
You've got no money
to offer these jokers.

752
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,100
<i> Well, if-- </i>

753
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:39,470
<i> if your people </i>
<i> don't pay, </i>

754
00:49:39,470 --> 00:49:41,570
<i> then, uh, then these </i>
<i> guys need to prove </i>

755
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:45,040
<i> that they're not </i>
<i> fooling around and-- </i>

756
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,140
<i> well, it can't be </i>
<i> your head-- </i>

757
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:51,080
<i> they'll send </i>
<i> to the police </i>
<i> in a box. </i>

758
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:52,820
<i> Don't worry, Ab. </i>
<i> We'll-- </i>

759
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:54,820
<i> pay whatever </i>
<i> it takes. </i>

760
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:57,020
<i> If it's </i>
<i> a hundred million, </i>
<i> we'll pay. </i>

761
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:59,590
<i> I want to get out of this </i>
<i> as much as you guys. </i>

762
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:02,990
<i> But we have to let </i>
<i> them sweat it out </i>
<i> another week. </i>

763
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,700
<i> Let them believe </i>
<i> that their screw-up </i>
<i> killed Heineken. </i>

764
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:10,070
You remind me again
why we grabbed
the driver.

765
00:50:10,070 --> 00:50:12,100
Why?
What's your point?

766
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:14,800
<i> A question </i>
<i> the police </i>
<i> are asking. </i>

767
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:18,040
Is, uh--are these guys
the real deal?

768
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:21,710
Or are they just
a bunch of pussies?

769
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:27,720
And if the answer is
they're a bunch
of pussies,

770
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,190
<i> they're going to string </i>
<i> this out forever. </i>

771
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:32,090
So what are you
trying to say?

772
00:50:32,090 --> 00:50:35,460
Well, we said
if they don't pay,
then there'll be blood.

773
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:39,660
You wrote that
in the letter.

774
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:42,570
<i> This is business. </i>

775
00:50:42,570 --> 00:50:45,470
It's nothing personal.

776
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:52,040
And they didn't
fucking pay.

777
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,840
- I agree.
<i>-  Oh, really? </i>

778
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,210
<i> Yeah. </i>
Yeah?

779
00:50:58,220 --> 00:50:59,720
Yeah?
You agree?
Yeah.

780
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:01,180
<i> With him? </i>

781
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:02,950
Alright, good.
Big man,

782
00:51:02,950 --> 00:51:05,260
alright then,
slice his fucking throat.

783
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:24,840
I'll do it.

784
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:40,620
<i> Willem-- </i>

785
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:42,890
<i> Hey. Hey. Hey. </i>

786
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:44,560
<i> You're acting </i>
<i> like a scared </i>
<i> little boy. </i>

787
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:46,130
Hey, you
fucking do it!

788
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:49,000
<i> A scared little boy. </i>

789
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,900
Fuck!

790
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,840
I didn't sign
up for this!

791
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:55,870
Cor, if he
does anything--

792
00:51:55,870 --> 00:51:57,940
anything!

793
00:51:57,940 --> 00:51:59,110
If he does
anything in there,

794
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:01,610
it's fucking
on you.

795
00:52:01,610 --> 00:52:03,050
Do something!

796
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:04,180
Fuck.

797
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:11,550
Man!

798
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:12,820
Use your head!

799
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:14,220
Oh, fuck.

800
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,070
Oh, fuck.

801
00:53:10,210 --> 00:53:12,720
You alright?

802
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,280
Stop what you're doing.

803
00:53:14,290 --> 00:53:16,050
What are you doing?

804
00:53:16,050 --> 00:53:18,860
What are
you doing?

805
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:20,090
What are you doing?

806
00:53:20,090 --> 00:53:21,720
Come here.
Come on.

807
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:22,990
Come on.

808
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:40,180
Is he alright?

809
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:41,740
Yeah, no,
he's okay.

810
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:43,780
He's fine.

811
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:46,050
We all just need
to go home,

812
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:47,920
take a breather,

813
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,290
get drunk, get laid,
whatever you got to do.

814
00:53:50,290 --> 00:53:52,820
<i> But we </i>
<i> just got to stick </i>
<i> to the routine </i>

815
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:55,190
<i> and we'll see each other </i>
<i> in a few days. </i>

816
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:57,130
Alright.
Let's go.

817
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:13,680
<i>...in a case that has riveted </i>
<i>the nation and much of Europe, </i>

818
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,850
<i> the kidnapping </i>
<i> of billionaire </i>
<i> Alfred Heineken </i>

819
00:54:15,850 --> 00:54:17,910
<i> has entered </i>
<i> its 19th day. </i>

820
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,950
<i> With no substantial leads </i>
<i> and no end in sight, </i>

821
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:24,190
<i> a massive manhunt involving </i>
<i> local and federal law </i>
<i> enforcement continues. </i>

822
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,960
<i> Oh, hey. </i>

823
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:36,770
Where've you been?

824
00:54:36,770 --> 00:54:38,970
You were supposed
to be at birth class.
<i> What? </i>

825
00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:41,140
No, S--
Fuck.

826
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:43,170
<i> No, no, no. </i>

827
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:45,380
Sonja!
Listen, I'm sorry.

828
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:46,980
Listen, I'll make
it up to you!

829
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:48,410
Alright?
I'll make it up to you.

830
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:50,750
Sonja--

831
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:07,460
Have they paid?
Am I to be set free?

832
00:55:29,790 --> 00:55:32,890
Did you give them
my message?

833
00:55:32,890 --> 00:55:37,090
You know,
they have
one more chance.

834
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:39,530
If they screw it
up this time--

835
00:55:39,530 --> 00:55:41,230
And they know
I've given you
my word

836
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:44,030
so they will pay, so--

837
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,840
how are you planning
to set us free?

838
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:50,810
<i> I will put </i>
<i> the both of you in a car </i>

839
00:55:50,810 --> 00:55:52,780
and, uh,
leave it somewhere.

840
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:54,240
Call your people.

841
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:57,150
Oh, good.

842
00:55:57,150 --> 00:55:59,050
<i> Listen, if your people </i>
<i> don't pay soon, </i>

843
00:55:59,050 --> 00:56:01,550
then I can't answer
for my people.

844
00:56:01,550 --> 00:56:03,120
<i> I'll tell you what. </i>
<i> If you put us </i>

845
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:05,820
in that car
right now, I'll, uh--

846
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:07,920
see to it that you get
what you want and...

847
00:56:07,930 --> 00:56:11,330
I'll make sure
you're free to spend it.

848
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:14,130
That's a promise
and I have the power
to do that.

849
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:16,370
You know?

850
00:56:16,370 --> 00:56:19,840
Of course.

851
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:22,000
You're a young man
and I must confess,
I do envy you.

852
00:56:22,010 --> 00:56:23,910
There's no way
you could have
done this without--

853
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:28,980
no way you could have
done it without those
men in your life

854
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:33,450
that you trust
with your life.
Friends.

855
00:56:33,450 --> 00:56:37,520
So congratulations,
well done, and uh--

856
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,260
soon you'll get
your money

857
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:45,430

very, very rich.

858
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:47,560
But, um--

859
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:50,000
But what?

860
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,100
No, what I meant
to say, my friend,
is that, uh--

861
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:56,310
there are two ways
a man can be rich
in this world.

862
00:56:56,310 --> 00:56:59,440
He can have
a lot of money

863
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:03,210
or he can have
a lot of friends.

864
00:57:03,210 --> 00:57:04,580

975
01:05:38,930 --> 01:05:40,660
They don't know
where the money is.

976
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:42,930
So, Cor,
how long we got

977
01:05:42,930 --> 01:05:44,700
<i> Come on. </i>
<i> Let's go! </i>
Where?

978
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:46,040
<i> To dig up the money </i>

<i> Then what? </i>

981
01:05:49,910 --> 01:05:50,610
<i> Well, I don't know! </i>

982
01:05:53,980 --> 01:05:55,640
What do you got?

983
01:05:55,650 --> 01:05:57,010
What have you got?
Come on, think.

984
01:05:57,010 --> 01:05:58,780
Alright,
I'm thinking...

985
01:05:58,780 --> 01:06:00,680
Come on,
come on!
Alright, alright!

986
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:02,650
I think me and Willem
go and we get
the money.

987
01:06:02,650 --> 01:06:04,790
<i> The five of us </i>
<i> can't stay in this car </i>

988

<i> going to ditch </i>

989

990
01:06:08,690 --> 01:06:11,430
Then I think what,

in four hours?

991
01:06:11,430 --> 01:06:13,160
The boatyard.
Out at Newlake.

992
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:15,600

Better get out

998
01:06:29,850 --> 01:06:31,880
Just be careful.
Don't go home.
Promise me.

Okay.
Okay.

1000
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:35,990

They are not here.

1005
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:04,180
They took
all our money.

1006
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:06,620
Did you knock
on the door?

1007
01:07:06,620 --> 01:07:09,690
No, I didn't
fucking knock
on the door.

1008
01:07:09,690 --> 01:07:10,890
Why should I
knock on the door?

1009
01:07:10,890 --> 01:07:12,190
Where are their cars?

1010
01:07:17,090 --> 01:07:18,560

Hey, come in.

1012
01:07:30,070 --> 01:07:31,740
Yeah, what's wrong
with him?

1013
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:32,910
What's right with him?

1014
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:49,660
Here.

1015
01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:50,960
Shit, that's way
too much.

1016
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:52,730
Now come on,
you deserve it.

1017
01:07:52,730 --> 01:07:54,700
Here, come here.
I want to talk to you.

1018
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:01,240
What's up?

1019
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:03,240
I want you
to take this money

1020
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:05,740
and I want you
to hide it in
the next 20 minutes.

1021
01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:07,980
Yeah, but I'll come
with you, right?
No.

1022
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:10,010
What do you mean?

1023
01:08:10,010 --> 01:08:13,050
Listen, you'll be fine.

1024
01:08:13,050 --> 01:08:14,820
Look, I love you.

1025
01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:16,950
Which means I want
what's best for you.

1026
01:08:16,950 --> 01:08:20,190
Now you listen to what
I've got to say. Alright?

1027
01:08:20,190 --> 01:08:22,830
Okay, good.
You'll be fine.

1028
01:08:22,830 --> 01:08:25,760
You take this,

1029
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:27,960
and you make life
work for you, alright?

1030
01:08:27,970 --> 01:08:30,930
Go on. Go on, get
the fuck out of here!

1031
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:32,670
You'll find me, yeah?
Yeah, of course.

1032
01:08:32,670 --> 01:08:34,000
You promise?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1033
01:08:44,850 --> 01:08:47,180
<i> Brakes is right. </i>

1034
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:49,720
<i> About what? </i>

1035
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:51,090
<i> Money's too heavy. </i>

1036
01:08:51,090 --> 01:08:54,160
We had to leave
a sack in that drum.

1037
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:56,630
You did what?

1038
01:08:56,630 --> 01:08:58,060
<i> Oh, come on. </i>
<i> You didn't even notice. </i>

1039
01:08:58,060 --> 01:09:00,000
Look at this, look!
You didn't even notice!

1040
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
<i> You left it </i>
<i> in the ground? </i>

1041
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,870
Seven fucking million?

1042
01:09:02,870 --> 01:09:03,900
Yeah, we'll get the rest
when we come back.

1043
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:05,700
<i> Come back? </i>

1044
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:07,700
I have a friend,
they live in Paris.

1045
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:09,200
We're going--
<i> We're going </i>
<i> to stay there </i>

1046
01:09:09,210 --> 01:09:12,880
until everything's
calmed down.

1047
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:15,280
Well, I can't.

1048
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:17,080
What do you mean?

1049
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:19,850
I can't stay
in fucking Paris.

1050
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:21,780
<i> Cor, I got a family. </i>

1051
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:22,850
I got kids.

1052
01:09:27,660 --> 01:09:28,990
What about
Mr. Heineken?

1053
01:09:28,990 --> 01:09:31,690
Mr. Heineken!
<i> Answer me! </i>

1054
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:35,130
You let Heineken out now
they will grab you, man.

1055
01:09:35,130 --> 01:09:37,270
If we don't,
he'll fucking die.

1056
01:09:37,270 --> 01:09:39,640
Well, once we get
to Paris,

1057
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:41,770
we can call
his people,
tip them off.

1058
01:09:41,770 --> 01:09:43,840
If they find him in Cat's shed,
then we can't ever go back.

1059
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:45,610
Think about that?
Come on, think
about it!

1060
01:09:45,610 --> 01:09:48,180
Jesus, man.
You leave half
your brain

1061
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:49,880
out in that whole
with the rest
of my money?

1062
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:51,310
It's safe.
It's fucking safe!

1063
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:52,680
It'll never be safe.

1064
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:54,850
<i> It's safe! </i>
No!

1065
01:09:54,850 --> 01:09:56,990
Don't you get
it, Cor?

1066
01:09:56,990 --> 01:09:58,920
It'll never be safe.
Not here.

1067
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:01,120
<i> Not in Paris. </i>

1068
01:10:01,130 --> 01:10:03,660
<i> We're lucky </i>
<i> if we can hang </i>
<i> out in Timbuktu. </i>

1069
01:10:03,660 --> 01:10:06,030
Take your fucking money,
take it! Take it!

1070
01:10:06,030 --> 01:10:08,360
We were worth
a lot more than that.

1071
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:13,700
I'll see you
on the outside.

1072
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:29,720
What about you?

1073
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:31,390
<i> Coming with us? </i>

1074
01:10:31,390 --> 01:10:32,650
Yeah, I'll come.

1075
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:53,710
<i> Shit. </i>

1076
01:11:10,730 --> 01:11:11,790
Halt!

1077
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:08,150

Wherever you are.

1078
01:12:08,150 --> 01:12:11,520
Ah. Come on, John.

1079
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:15,790
Sing with me,
get your mind
off all this rubbish.

1080
01:12:15,790 --> 01:12:19,830
Any song,
what is it?

1081
01:12:43,790 --> 01:12:45,420
Are you the police?

1082
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:46,920
<i> What the hell </i>

1083
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:48,420

my chauffeur,
go and get him, please.

1085

1089
01:12:57,330 --> 01:12:58,400

1090
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,000
Oh, God!

1091
01:13:04,510 --> 01:13:06,380
Fuck.

01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:21,640
<i> I honestly believe </i>
<i> that they believed </i>

1189
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:23,750
<i> it was </i>
<i> a business deal, </i>
<i> nothing more. </i>

1190
01:20:23,750 --> 01:20:25,410
<i> Where do you think </i>
<i> Cor Van Hout </i>

1191
01:20:25,420 --> 01:20:26,710
<i> and Willem Holleeder </i>
<i> are now? </i>

1192
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:28,750
<i> It doesn't matter. </i>

1193
01:20:28,750 --> 01:20:31,550
<i> As the great fighter </i>
<i> Joe Louis used to say, </i>

1194
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:34,020
<i> "You can run </i>
<i> but you cannot hide." </i>

1195
01:20:36,330 --> 01:20:37,730
<i> We'll get them. </i>
<i> Thank you. </i>

1196
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:40,760
Hm.

1197
01:20:43,870 --> 01:20:45,670
I'm going
to have to phone Sonja.

1198
01:20:45,670 --> 01:20:46,670
You can't do that.

1199
01:21:05,020 --> 01:21:07,620
I told you,
you can't do that.

1200
01:21:33,980 --> 01:21:36,320
<i> What about that one? Huh? </i>

1201
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:38,420
- That one's perfect.
-       <i> What about it? </i>

1202
01:21:38,420 --> 01:21:42,320
Well, you know, it's
got those tall windows
that you like.

1203
01:21:42,330 --> 01:21:44,390
I bet it's got a big
backyard for the kid.

1204
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:48,600
<i> If we're buying </i>
<i> fancy houses, </i>

1205
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:50,330
we might as well buy
one for Willem next door,

1206
01:21:50,330 --> 01:21:51,830
otherwise I'll never
see either of you.

1207
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:52,930
Now he can buy
his own.

1208
01:21:57,740 --> 01:21:59,540
You're never even
going to try to live

1209
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:00,710
in the real world,
are you?

1210
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:14,860
Yeah, hello.

1211
01:22:14,860 --> 01:22:16,860
<i> Karin, look, it's me. </i>

1212
01:22:16,860 --> 01:22:18,990
<i> Don't hang up. </i>
Cor?

1213
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,830
Now, listen to me.

1214
01:22:20,830 --> 01:22:22,600
I'm going to give
you a number

1215
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:23,930
and I need you
to tell Sonja

1216
01:22:23,930 --> 01:22:26,430
to call me
as soon as she can.

1217
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:28,470
<i> from a phone box </i>
<i> some way over </i>
<i> from the house. </i>

1218
01:22:28,470 --> 01:22:30,370
<i> You understand? </i>
Where are you?

1219
01:22:30,370 --> 01:22:32,510
<i> Listen to me. </i>
<i> Listen to me, please. </i>

1220
01:22:32,510 --> 01:22:36,010
Promise me,
look, it's for her.

1221
01:22:53,660 --> 01:22:55,630
- Hello?
<i>-  What did you do, Cor? </i>

1222
01:22:55,630 --> 01:22:57,800
What the hell
did you do?

1223
01:22:57,800 --> 01:23:00,570
Don't start that now,
we haven't got
time for that.

1224
01:23:00,570 --> 01:23:03,500
Look, there's no time--
<i> Cor, what the hell </i>
<i> did you do? </i>

1225
01:23:03,510 --> 01:23:05,410
<i> Cor, where are you? </i>

1226
01:23:05,410 --> 01:23:07,010
<i> Answer me, Cor. </i>

1227
01:23:07,010 --> 01:23:10,680
<i> Where--? </i>
<i> Cor? </i>

1228
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:12,050
<i> Cor? </i>
<i> Where--? </i>

1229
01:23:12,050 --> 01:23:14,980
<i> Where are you? </i>

1230
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:16,520
Sonja?

1231
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:18,450
Son--Sonja, are you there?

1232
01:23:18,460 --> 01:23:21,060
<i> Sonja, Sonja! </i>
I'm here.
I'm here, Cor.

1233
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:23,790
<i> Cor, Cor, this is-- </i>

1234
01:23:23,790 --> 01:23:28,560
they follow
me everywhere.

1235
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:33,940
<i> I know. </i>
<i> I just wanted </i>
<i> to hear your voice. </i>

1236
01:23:33,940 --> 01:23:36,070
If I buy a loaf
of bread,

1237
01:23:36,070 --> 01:23:40,580
they check my money
in case it's--

1238
01:23:40,580 --> 01:23:41,810
I want to be
where you are.

1239
01:23:43,950 --> 01:23:45,010
<i> Please. </i>

1240
01:23:52,860 --> 01:23:55,990
Soon, Son, soon.

1241
01:23:55,990 --> 01:23:58,830
Listen,

1242
01:23:58,830 --> 01:24:02,530
after the baby,
I can come back, alright?

1243
01:24:02,530 --> 01:24:04,200
<i> Soon. </i>
<i> That's a promise. </i>

1244
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:06,630
You promise?

1245
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:08,640
<i> I promise. </i>

1246
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:10,940
<i> I promise, </i>
<i> I promise, </i>
<i> I promise. </i>

1247
01:24:10,940 --> 01:24:14,140
<i> Listen to me, </i>
<i> okay, Son, listen? </i>

1248
01:24:14,140 --> 01:24:16,840
We're going to be
a real family.
You know?

1249
01:24:16,850 --> 01:24:19,050
We'll be
a real family

1250
01:24:19,050 --> 01:24:22,780
and I'm going to give you
everything you ever wanted.

1251
01:24:25,190 --> 01:24:27,720
And believe me.

1252
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:30,490
Huh, you believe me?
<i> I believe you. </i>

1253
01:24:30,490 --> 01:24:35,530
But Cor, do you know
how big this thing is?

1254
01:24:35,530 --> 01:24:37,770
They've arrested everybody
you ever met in your life.

1255
01:24:37,770 --> 01:24:39,930
They bugged
all the phones.

1256
01:24:39,940 --> 01:24:41,840
<i> Wait, wait, wait. </i>
<i> What do you mean everyone? </i>

1257
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:44,170
<i> Like Arthur </i>
<i> and my parents, </i>

1258
01:24:44,170 --> 01:24:48,210
<i> Your parents? </i>
all your friends,
all of mine,
everybody's.

1259
01:24:48,210 --> 01:24:51,950
<i> Cor, I've got to go. </i>

1260
01:24:51,950 --> 01:24:53,080
I love you.

1261
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:54,850
Okay?
Be safe.

1262
01:24:54,850 --> 01:24:56,850
No, don't hang up!
Don't hang up!

1263
01:24:56,850 --> 01:24:58,290
- Son, don't hang up!
-                   <i> I love you! </i>

1264
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:38,260
I, uh--

1265
01:25:38,260 --> 01:25:39,630
I think I messed up.

1266
01:25:41,700 --> 01:25:45,300
I think they have
this number--

1267
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:46,570
since last night.

1268
01:25:49,140 --> 01:25:51,040
Just letting you know.

1269
01:25:58,050 --> 01:25:59,810
We better get
our stuff then.

1270
01:26:29,180 --> 01:26:32,780
<i> Willem, wait. </i>

1271
01:26:32,780 --> 01:26:37,220
<i> Something feels wrong. </i>

1272
01:26:37,220 --> 01:26:40,250
<i> It seems too quiet. </i>

1273
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:09,750
You want to do this?

1274
01:27:09,750 --> 01:27:12,720
You know,
I think I'll sit
this one out.

1275
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:14,660
In prison?

1276
01:27:14,660 --> 01:27:16,960
Look, we can get out
while we're still young.

1277
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:18,990
They'll never find
the money.

1278
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:22,860
You want to bet?

1279
01:27:26,740 --> 01:27:27,940
You know I do.

1280
01:29:14,810 --> 01:29:17,210
<i> There are two ways a man </i>
<i> can be rich in this world. </i>

1281
01:29:17,210 --> 01:29:19,280
<i> He can have </i>
<i> a lot of money-- </i>

1282
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:22,550
<i> or he can have </i>
<i> a lot of friends. </i>

1283
01:29:22,550 --> 01:29:24,820
<i> But he cannot have both. </i>
