1
0:0:1.255 --> 0:0:2.523
Can you remember the headline

2
0:0:2.556 --> 0:0:4.292
when you uncovered
that spy ring in the Pentagon?

3
0:0:4.324 --> 0:0:6.459
The football.
England beat Germany, 5-1.

4
0:0:6.493 --> 0:0:7.994
Thatcher's
assassination attempt.

5
0:0:8.029 --> 0:0:9.096
Charles and Di's wedding.

6
0:0:9.128 --> 0:0:10.698
(CHUCKLES) Hey, Bjorn Borg.

7
0:0:21.208 --> 0:0:22.944
Babe, if you can hear me,

8
0:0:22.976 --> 0:0:25.246
I want you to know
that I love you.

9
0:0:25.279 --> 0:0:27.315
And if we get through this,
and you'll have me back...

10
0:0:27.347 --> 0:0:30.184
I wanna be with you.
No matter what.

11
0:0:30.217 --> 0:0:31.284
I promise I won't let you down.

12
0:0:31.318 --> 0:0:32.919
It's all gonna be all right.

13
0:0:32.953 --> 0:0:34.354
My favorite singer.

14
0:0:34.387 --> 0:0:36.623
I don't bloody know.
How would I know that?

15
0:0:36.657 --> 0:0:38.959
It's John Denver.
Merlin!

16
0:0:38.993 --> 0:0:40.995
Have you got eyes
on that location yet?

17
0:0:41.029 --> 0:0:43.097
Soon. The reconnaissance
drone's about an hour away.

18
0:0:43.130 --> 0:0:44.264
Which gives us time
to sort out...

19
0:0:44.297 --> 0:0:45.999
Bollocks, we haven't
time for anything.

20
0:0:46.033 --> 0:0:48.336
I'm leaving now.
With or without you.

21
0:1:6.319 --> 0:1:8.255
Hello!
(GUNS COCKING)

22
0:1:8.288 --> 0:1:9.657
GUARD: Identify yourself.

23
0:1:9.690 --> 0:1:14.227
My name is Stacey Prewitt.
I'm Ms. Poppy Adams' attorney.

24
0:1:14.261 --> 0:1:16.330
Poppy, you expecting
a lawyer tonight?

25
0:1:16.363 --> 0:1:18.399
Oh, yes. Please send him in.

26
0:1:18.431 --> 0:1:21.535
But don't forget to
reactivate the landmines.

27
0:1:23.971 --> 0:1:25.606
(PROTESTERS CLAMORING)

28
0:1:26.873 --> 0:1:28.407
Good evening, Ms. Adams.

29
0:1:28.441 --> 0:1:33.713
My lawyer is bringing you
the document right now.

30
0:1:33.747 --> 0:1:35.216
Hurry up.

31
0:1:35.248 --> 0:1:36.349
And once you countersign,

32
0:1:36.383 --> 0:1:37.717
it becomes
an executive decree...

33
0:1:37.752 --> 0:1:38.852
and you can't back out,

34
0:1:38.886 --> 0:1:40.187
and then I release the antidote.

35
0:1:40.220 --> 0:1:41.555
Can you give me any assurance

36
0:1:41.588 --> 0:1:43.356
you can get it
out there in time?

37
0:1:43.390 --> 0:1:44.458
And where's it gonna come from?

38
0:1:44.492 --> 0:1:45.825
How long it'll take
to distribute?

39
0:1:45.859 --> 0:1:48.462
I wouldn't worry about that.
I have secure stockpiles...

40
0:1:48.496 --> 0:1:51.532
hidden in every
major city worldwide.

41
0:1:51.565 --> 0:1:53.968
And when I enter
the access code...

42
0:1:54.001 --> 0:1:55.401
my fleet of drones

43
0:1:55.435 --> 0:1:58.305
will distribute
the antidote immediately.

44
0:1:58.337 --> 0:2:0.840
So don't dilly-dally
signin' that document

45
0:2:0.874 --> 0:2:2.642
'cause time is running out.

46
0:2:4.011 --> 0:2:5.446
(laughs)

47
0:2:5.480 --> 0:2:6.814
You dumb bitch!

48
0:2:16.791 --> 0:2:17.824
You all right?

49
0:2:19.894 --> 0:2:21.929
What was that
phone call you got?

50
0:2:21.962 --> 0:2:24.231
Let's not, Harry.

51
0:2:24.264 --> 0:2:25.565
I don't think
you'd sympathize...

52
0:2:25.599 --> 0:2:27.767
and I'm not really in
the mood for a lecture.

53
0:2:31.771 --> 0:2:32.806
All right.

54
0:2:35.676 --> 0:2:38.613
How about a martini?
For old times' sake?

55
0:2:40.713 --> 0:2:41.748
Yeah, all right.

56
0:2:54.895 --> 0:2:56.864
I had a girlfriend.

57
0:2:59.499 --> 0:3:0.600
I lost her.
