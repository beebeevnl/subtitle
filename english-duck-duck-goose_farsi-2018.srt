1
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:43,354
Whoo-hoo-hooo-hoo!

2
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:45,273
- Hey, Larry!
- Hello, Peng.

3
00:01:45,356 --> 00:01:47,692
Oh, sorry, Larry.

4
00:01:48,026 --> 00:01:49,652
- Whoo-hoo!
- Oh!

5
00:01:49,736 --> 00:01:51,529
- Later guys!
- That is a violation--

6
00:01:56,075 --> 00:01:59,037
Whoo-hoo! Sorry, guys, I'm running late.

7
00:02:00,163 --> 00:02:04,083
Whoo! Goose on the loose!

8
00:02:07,337 --> 00:02:10,840
There will be geese
to the right, left, up, and down.

9
00:02:11,341 --> 00:02:13,718
Please check
before you answer nature's call.

10
00:02:13,802 --> 00:02:15,929
Or at least give a brother a honk.

11
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,308
Ugh, Jenkins!
You should have gone before we left! Ugh!

12
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:21,392
As I was saying--

13
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,898
Peng, you're late. Again!
That makes you a weak link.

14
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:29,943
I've got no use for a loose goose.
Not in my flock.

15
00:02:30,026 --> 00:02:33,863
Now, statistically speaking,
you're not likely to die in the air.

16
00:02:33,947 --> 00:02:35,490
This is a motivational speech?

17
00:02:35,573 --> 00:02:39,035
No, uh, there's a thousand other ways
you can get into trouble.

18
00:02:39,118 --> 00:02:41,162
Get just one feather out of place...

19
00:02:41,246 --> 00:02:42,789
and you could be staring

20
00:02:42,872 --> 00:02:44,874
at your poop deck from the inside out.

21
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:46,167
That's why we train.

22
00:02:46,251 --> 00:02:48,670
Train, train, train and train again.

23
00:02:48,753 --> 00:02:50,505
Birds of a feather migrate together!

24
00:02:50,588 --> 00:02:52,882
Birds of a feather migrate together!

25
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:54,717
Uh, question.

26
00:02:54,801 --> 00:03:00,098
My friend here, Crazy Eye, wants to know,
do we have to migrate in a V formation?

27
00:03:00,181 --> 00:03:02,559
- Excuse me?
- I mean. Couldn't we try another letter?

28
00:03:02,642 --> 00:03:04,185
Yeah, like maybe a W!

29
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:05,895
Yeah. That's a capital, right? I'll go--

30
00:03:05,979 --> 00:03:09,107
Peng,
don't make me turn this V around.

31
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,692
Now, in answer to your question,

32
00:03:10,775 --> 00:03:14,988
over many generations the V formation
has aerodynamically proven to be--

33
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:16,239
Oh! What about an A?

34
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:17,198
What-- No.

35
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:21,452
Well, technically,
that's just an inverted V, right, Bing?

36
00:03:21,536 --> 00:03:25,290
You... We fly in a V.
Birds of a feather migrate together!

37
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,751
Birds of a feather migrate together.

38
00:03:28,835 --> 00:03:30,378
Now how about a hashtag?

39
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:36,551
I don't even know what that is.
No! No, no, no, no, no!

40
00:03:36,634 --> 00:03:40,597
It has to be a V!
Now, birds of a feather migrate together!

41
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:46,269
I said,
birds of a feather migrate together!

42
00:03:46,352 --> 00:03:49,063
Where is everybody?

43
00:03:50,398 --> 00:03:51,733
Follow me!

44
00:03:52,358 --> 00:03:55,653
Whoo! Yeah!

45
00:03:59,032 --> 00:04:02,660
This way! Ouch. Whoo!

46
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:08,291
Keep up slowpokes!

47
00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:12,045
Oh, yeah, baby!

48
00:04:15,924 --> 00:04:19,594
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

49
00:04:21,638 --> 00:04:23,806
Whoo!

50
00:04:25,642 --> 00:04:28,144
Now this is flying!

51
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:31,689
Mmm.

52
00:04:39,614 --> 00:04:40,740
Ow!

53
00:04:40,823 --> 00:04:42,909
Chao! Chao, stop.

54
00:04:42,992 --> 00:04:43,952
I'm stuck.

55
00:04:45,912 --> 00:04:48,206
- Ah!
- Come on. Hurry.

56
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:51,501
Chi, if I don't eat something soon,
I'm gonna die. To death!

57
00:04:51,584 --> 00:04:54,629
Come on, bro,
you ate like five minutes ago!

58
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:56,422
You know we're not supposed
to leave the road.

59
00:04:56,506 --> 00:04:58,549
Chao, come back here! Right now! Chao--

60
00:04:58,633 --> 00:05:01,219
- Oh, look at that! Breakfast!
- No! No caterpillars.

61
00:05:01,302 --> 00:05:03,513
You'll be barfing up chunks
if you eat that and you know it.

62
00:05:03,596 --> 00:05:04,973
But I'm hungry, Chi!

63
00:05:05,056 --> 00:05:06,099
You are always hungry.

64
00:05:06,182 --> 00:05:08,518
There'll be plenty to eat
once we get to Pleasant Valley.

65
00:05:08,601 --> 00:05:09,811
Pleasant Valley, here we come!

66
00:05:09,894 --> 00:05:12,605
Great work, guys. And remember,
we've got to go before the snow comes.

67
00:05:12,689 --> 00:05:14,565
Come on!
I can feel the air getting colder.

68
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:16,275
Oh! What's going on? What the--

69
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:18,820
Hey, Jinjing!
I hope I'm not holding you up?

70
00:05:18,903 --> 00:05:20,488
Peng. Not today.

71
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:22,448
- Hey, Peng.
- Oh, look at that wingspan.

72
00:05:22,532 --> 00:05:27,286
What do you say me and you find some
secluded spot to enjoy the harvest moon?

73
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,038
I made the moon for you, you know that?

74
00:05:29,122 --> 00:05:31,499
You made the moon for me. Yeah, right.

75
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:33,835
We're leaving for the haven tonight!

76
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:36,587
Remember?
Listen, my father would kill me if I--

77
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:38,798
Funny. I didn't know chickens could fly.

78
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:42,552
Are you calling me chicken?

79
00:05:42,635 --> 00:05:43,678
Bock, bock, bock, bock-- Bye!

80
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:45,179
Oh, you want to race?

81
00:05:45,263 --> 00:05:47,015
It's on!

82
00:05:51,686 --> 00:05:52,854
Hey, move it!

83
00:05:53,563 --> 00:05:55,815
Wow. That's a goose.

84
00:05:57,066 --> 00:05:58,192
On your left!

85
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:00,945
Move over!

86
00:06:05,116 --> 00:06:06,200
Gotcha!

87
00:06:08,411 --> 00:06:09,954
Hey, no fair!

88
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:11,914
Whoo!

89
00:06:11,998 --> 00:06:14,417
Wait! Wait, I need another one!

90
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,462
I must be crazy.
What is it about you?

91
00:06:17,545 --> 00:06:22,341
Well, I'm good looking,
and charming, and-- Whoo!

92
00:06:23,676 --> 00:06:26,220
I'm the best flyer in the flock.

93
00:06:26,304 --> 00:06:28,681
Uh, best flyer in the flock, huh?

94
00:06:29,432 --> 00:06:32,727
Whoa!

95
00:06:33,144 --> 00:06:35,271
Hey, whoa! Look out!

96
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:41,819
Ow!

97
00:06:43,112 --> 00:06:44,113
Oh!

98
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:45,823
Whoa!

99
00:06:49,702 --> 00:06:51,537
Hey! Take it easy son.

100
00:06:51,621 --> 00:06:54,499
- I just had a new roof put on.
- Uh-oh...

101
00:06:54,582 --> 00:06:56,793
Ow! Ow!

102
00:06:56,876 --> 00:06:58,628
I told you, you were too heavy.

103
00:06:58,711 --> 00:06:59,587
- Me?
- Yes.

104
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,880
Me? Oh, I like that!

105
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:04,842
Who was it who gorged themselves
on all those frogs this morning? Hmm?

106
00:07:04,926 --> 00:07:06,010
How dare you!

107
00:07:06,094 --> 00:07:08,513
Now you see what he's done.
He's got us attacking each other.

108
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:13,017
Peng, your misguided
landing made me lose a leg!

109
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:17,814
One of a pair. Do you see this?
My leg has gone. Completely gone!

110
00:07:17,897 --> 00:07:18,856
No, no wait.

111
00:07:20,525 --> 00:07:22,860
Silly me.

112
00:07:23,194 --> 00:07:26,823
Nonetheless, my colleague and I
are here in our official capacity

113
00:07:26,906 --> 00:07:28,866
as representatives of The Lakes.

114
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:31,160
A family friendly community.

115
00:07:31,244 --> 00:07:33,246
Yeah. So, what's the problem?

116
00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:35,289
Yeah, so what's the problem?

117
00:07:35,373 --> 00:07:37,792
- Well, the problem?
- Oh, the problem!

118
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,837
Is that you are not family friendly.

119
00:07:42,088 --> 00:07:44,757
Ow! Ow! Ow!

120
00:07:44,841 --> 00:07:46,634
Oh!

121
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:47,718
Come along, Giles.

122
00:07:49,762 --> 00:07:51,180
Oh! Poo bombs!

123
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:55,101
Oh, no. I just had my feathers
done this morning.

124
00:07:56,227 --> 00:07:57,812
Peng, Dad's really mad and--

125
00:07:57,895 --> 00:08:02,775
Your dad's always mad.
How about another kiss? Come here. Mmm--

126
00:08:02,859 --> 00:08:04,152
Oh!

127
00:08:04,235 --> 00:08:06,320
- Hi, Dad.
- How's it going, peaches?

128
00:08:06,404 --> 00:08:07,780
- Peng, what were you thinking?
- Ooh!

129
00:08:07,864 --> 00:08:09,824
- Ow, ow, ow, ow!
- He's sorry, Dad.

130
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:15,663
Ow. Sorry? Jeez! Relax.
No one got hurt. It was just a little fun.

131
00:08:17,582 --> 00:08:19,834
Fun, huh? Migration isn't about fun.

132
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:22,920
It's about covering your tail-feathers
in case something comes up from behind.

133
00:08:23,004 --> 00:08:24,589
- Ow!
- Now that was fun.

134
00:08:24,672 --> 00:08:26,299
Everybody. See that feather?

135
00:08:26,382 --> 00:08:28,718
It's moving from the north to the south,
just like the wind.

136
00:08:28,801 --> 00:08:29,677
What does that tell you?

137
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,137
Winter's coming early.

138
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,306
Bing! Smart girl.

139
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:37,935
And in case some of us have forgotten,
this is why we migrate.

140
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:39,562
To stay ahead of the snow,

141
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:42,690
and to get to the thermal pools
before we all wind up in the frozen aisle

142
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:45,860
with our giblets in a bag
stuffed up our communal hoo-ha.

143
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:48,362
- Hoo-ha!
- It can be uncomfortable.

144
00:08:48,446 --> 00:08:49,530
We fly at sunset!

145
00:08:49,614 --> 00:08:51,866
I need all responsible flyers
front and center.

146
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:54,076
You know who you are. This is not a drill.

147
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:01,584
Not you. I'm giving you
one more chance to grow up.

148
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:05,254
Show you belong to this flock.
Lead the junior flyers to the haven.

149
00:09:05,338 --> 00:09:07,798
Hey Peng! Peng! Over here!

150
00:09:08,466 --> 00:09:10,468
Are you kidding? Hey guys!

151
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:12,470
I can't fly with the kids.

152
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:15,473
They're childish.
Not gonna do it!

153
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:19,727
Listen, Mr. Fun, maybe the juniors can
teach you a thing or two about teamwork.

154
00:09:20,186 --> 00:09:21,103
"Teamwork..."

155
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:25,524
Fly with the kids. Can you believe that?
I mean, me?

156
00:09:25,608 --> 00:09:28,027
They're so slow
it'd be like flying backwards.

157
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,030
The best flyer in the flock
wouldn't think twice about it.

158
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:35,409
Exactly. Even if I leave tomorrow,
I would get there before you.

159
00:09:35,493 --> 00:09:37,703
Yeah. That's because
you're flying by yourself.

160
00:09:37,787 --> 00:09:40,957
Anyone can do that.
Sticking together, that's what's harder.

161
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:45,544
Yeah, I agree with you,
but come on, I mean the juniors?

162
00:09:45,628 --> 00:09:48,965
Honk if you need me, Peng.
Otherwise, see ya when I see ya.

163
00:09:49,048 --> 00:09:51,592
I buried treasure. It's in the--

164
00:09:56,389 --> 00:10:00,059
Wait! Guys! Guys!
Wait for us! Please--

165
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:01,811
Shh! Look!

166
00:10:03,688 --> 00:10:09,777
Two little orphans,
all alone in a big wide world.

167
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:14,740
So vulnerable, so sad, so delicious.

168
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:18,327
They're sitting ducks. Let's eat them now.

169
00:10:18,411 --> 00:10:21,539
Patience, it'll be dark soon.

170
00:10:24,292 --> 00:10:28,838
Peng, it's migration day.
Why didn't you leave with the others?

171
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:30,965
I'll go tomorrow, Larry.

172
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:34,927
I can't wait to see their faces
when I'm waiting for them at the waypoint.

173
00:10:35,011 --> 00:10:38,848
Son, if you live your life
like it's always a race,

174
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:43,060
chances are you'll get
exactly what you want.

175
00:10:43,144 --> 00:10:45,021
See, that's what I'm saying.

176
00:10:45,104 --> 00:10:47,315
What I meant was,

177
00:10:47,398 --> 00:10:51,193
you'll pass everyone by
and wind up with yourself.

178
00:10:51,277 --> 00:10:53,112
No one else.

179
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:57,992
All I know, Larry, is life is a race.
And nobody wants to be a loser.

180
00:10:58,075 --> 00:11:01,954
Hmm. Did I ever tell you
about the turtle and the rabbit?

181
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:07,668
Well, now see, a cousin of mine,
decided to race a jackrabbit.

182
00:11:07,752 --> 00:11:13,382
Everyone told him, "You're crazy.
A turtle ain't built for speed."

183
00:11:13,466 --> 00:11:19,263
But he went ahead anyway and you know,
the darnedest thing happened.

184
00:11:19,347 --> 00:11:24,435
I'm just gonna spit-ball here, um,
the turtle got to the finish line first?

185
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:27,355
Nope. Never saw him again.

186
00:11:27,438 --> 00:11:31,442
Crazy varmint had no sense of direction.

187
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:34,653
That's a good one, Larry.

188
00:11:34,737 --> 00:11:39,575
Peng. Whoa! Whee! I'm not a frog.

189
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:41,786
Sorry, Larry. You okay?

190
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:45,664
I'm all right. Feel fine!
Cleared my sinuses.

191
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,293
"Wind up with yourself."

192
00:11:49,377 --> 00:11:52,380
Like I'm gonna take advice
from a talking rock.

193
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:03,682
Just to recap, flock, this is not a drill.

194
00:12:03,766 --> 00:12:06,936
The chances of fatality at this point
are exceptionally slim,

195
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:09,688
only one in five of us are likely to die.

196
00:12:12,525 --> 00:12:17,071
Excellent form recruits! Just like a V!
Keep form! Keep the V!

197
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:20,825
All right flock, keep it loose!
Fly like a goose!

198
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:22,910
- I'm kidding. Keep the V.
- Sorry, I'm late, Dad.

199
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:25,871
JJ, honey, I was really worried
about you for a second there.

200
00:12:25,955 --> 00:12:28,791
Sorry, Dad. I really tried
to talk some sense into Peng.

201
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:30,459
Sense? Into Peng?

202
00:12:30,543 --> 00:12:33,629
It'd be easier to train a frog to fly.

203
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:35,548
No offense, Chauncey.

204
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:21,135
It's okay, little brother.
I think it's gone.

205
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:22,094
Surprise!

206
00:13:22,178 --> 00:13:24,930
Look out! Run!

207
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:37,485
Ducklings,
party of two, your table's ready.

208
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:43,115
Sorry to disturb you. We're going now.

209
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,035
No, we're not!
Our dinner's in there somewhere.

210
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:49,413
You're kidding right? Get lost!

211
00:13:49,914 --> 00:13:52,249
If I could fly,
I'd be having goose tonight!

212
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,417
Look out, Peng!

213
00:13:53,501 --> 00:13:54,668
Oh! If it's goose you want.

214
00:13:54,752 --> 00:13:55,836
- Where--
- On your left!

215
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,422
- Where are you?
- Other left, genius.

216
00:13:58,506 --> 00:14:00,090
This isn't a fair fight!

217
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:01,342
Whoops!

218
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,387
I didn't hear a splash.

219
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:07,806
Hmm. There it is.

220
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:12,561
No! The water's everywhere!

221
00:14:12,645 --> 00:14:13,979
I hate water!

222
00:14:17,525 --> 00:14:21,820
Oh, I'll get you back for this,
if it's the last thing I do!

223
00:14:24,323 --> 00:14:26,825
Uh, must've been a catfish.

224
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:30,704
Wow!

225
00:14:30,788 --> 00:14:34,583
I'm so not a cat person.

226
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:55,312
Ugh. Is that worm breath?

227
00:14:55,396 --> 00:14:57,690
What the-- What-- What? What--

228
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:02,486
Ah, ducks? Ugh, what the--

229
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:03,529
- Hey.
- Ow!

230
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:07,449
Ew! Ugh! Beat it, weirdos.

231
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:11,328
I must be shell-shocked.
Are those your kids?

232
00:15:11,412 --> 00:15:13,664
Yeah, sure, Larry. I'm their mom.

233
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:14,957
You're our mom?

234
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,625
- What? No! Ahh!
- I knew it!

235
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:19,795
- Oh, Mommy! I love you so much!
- Let go! No! No, no, no!

236
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:22,047
- I always wanted a mom just like you!
- Chao, stop. Please, no!

237
00:15:22,131 --> 00:15:23,841
Well, well, well...

238
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:25,259
Could you please just get back here?

239
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:28,095
- Peng, I had no idea you were expecting.
- What?

240
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:30,389
Congratulations, Mother Goose!

241
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:32,141
Look at me! Do I look like a mommy?

242
00:15:32,224 --> 00:15:34,184
I'm sorry, he hasn't imprinted yet,

243
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:37,354
so he thinks that anyone with feathers
could be our mom.

244
00:15:37,438 --> 00:15:42,735
Imprinted? He's imprinting on my leg!
Do you understand that that's disgusting?

245
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:46,488
Gross. Ew. This is-- Ugh. I'm out of here.

246
00:15:46,572 --> 00:15:48,032
- Please wait!
- What?

247
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:49,992
Look, I'm Chi,

248
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:51,702
- and this is my little brother Chao...
- Yeah?

249
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:53,662
And we got separated from our flock
and we really--

250
00:15:53,746 --> 00:15:57,541
Here's the thing: I'm not his mommy
and I'm not your baby-sitter.

251
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,001
- Baby? I am not a baby.
- Mommy!

252
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:00,961
For your information,
I am sixteen days old.

253
00:16:01,045 --> 00:16:04,673
Oh, sorry!
I didn't know you were so ancient.

254
00:16:04,757 --> 00:16:07,009
Ow. Seriously, stop that! My butt--

255
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:09,928
- Stop. Hey, quit it. Ow! Stop. Hey!
- Chao, stop it, okay?

256
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:11,847
Please just get off of him.

257
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,099
Just wait.

258
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:17,311
You crashed into our flock,
and that is child endangerment,

259
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:18,812
which makes you responsible.

260
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:20,189
What? That's-- Ow!

261
00:16:20,272 --> 00:16:24,151
The only thing in danger around here
is me getting plucked alive.

262
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:25,694
Look, can you help us or not?

263
00:16:25,778 --> 00:16:28,155
I would say I'm an "or not."
Absolutely not.

264
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:31,659
I want nothing to do with you
and the baby piranha.

265
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:32,993
I got a flight to catch.

266
00:16:33,077 --> 00:16:36,038
You are a dirty pile of jerk feathers.

267
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:37,790
"Jerk feathers?" That's an insult?

268
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:40,376
Wha-- What the--

269
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:43,170
Would you just get off me, you looney!

270
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:44,588
Oh, no!

271
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:55,391
What a day.

272
00:16:55,474 --> 00:16:58,185
Well, at least I know
it can't get any worse.

273
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:01,897
What?

274
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:02,815
Ah!

275
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:08,862
Oh, all right. Okay, don't panic, Peng.
Okay, it might not be that bad.

276
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:14,952
Okay, Peng. Here we go. Come on.

277
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:17,746
I'm doing it. I'm doing it.

278
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,209
You're not doing it!

279
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:23,419
Oh, no.

280
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:26,964
Oh, great.

281
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:28,924
Now, isn't this interesting.

282
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:32,636
Frazier, it seems the new mother
is unable to fly.

283
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,807
Yes, indeed, Giles.
I do believe she's a lame duck.

284
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,308
Uh... Goose actually.

285
00:17:38,392 --> 00:17:41,937
What a terrible thing it is
to be injured in the wild.

286
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,106
Oh, yes, it's deadly I understand.

287
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:47,651
Yes, a lone goose could be reduced
to foie gras in mere moments.

288
00:17:47,735 --> 00:17:50,154
Oh! That would be quite a show.

289
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:52,906
Yes. Yes, dinner and a show.

290
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:59,329
Wait, what? Uh, uh, guys, look...

291
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:00,748
Ow!

292
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:06,003
I know I may have been
a little rough at times but--

293
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:08,797
- We know what you're up to, Peng.
- Yes, we do. What is he up to?

294
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:11,717
You simply want us around
so that you're not a sitting duck.

295
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,260
- Goose.
- Goose! Goose!

296
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:15,846
Look, all I'm saying is
that the three of us,

297
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:18,891
if we were to walk to the haven together,
that would be all right, right?

298
00:18:18,974 --> 00:18:23,145
Walk? On these spindly legs?
Have you gone absolutely mad, sir?

299
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:25,981
Not only is it dangerous
to travel on foot,

300
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:28,358
but quite frankly, we would look silly.

301
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:37,159
Guys, come on, you know what's gonna
happen to me. Winters coming and--

302
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:39,828
Yes, and you'll be a dead duck.

303
00:18:39,912 --> 00:18:42,247
- Goose, actually!
- Goose! Goose!

304
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:44,082
I know what you're thinking.

305
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:47,211
You're thinking,
"If only I had a companion,

306
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:50,297
some trusty friend to walk with me."
Am I right?

307
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:54,134
- Uh, thanks, but I--
- Hey, I know turtles don't migrate,

308
00:18:54,218 --> 00:18:59,598
but my mom said I'd never go anywhere
unless I stuck my neck out.

309
00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:02,810
<i>Andalé amigo!</i>

310
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:06,522
Okay, okay.
Think, think, think, Peng. Think!

311
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:08,398
Wait a minute.

312
00:19:08,816 --> 00:19:12,736
What I need is something that can
throw the bad guys off my scent.

313
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,863
An insurance policy. That's...

314
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:19,993
Oh! Oh, oh!
I don't need to be faster than a predator.

315
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:23,038
I need to be faster than a companion.

316
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:29,169
Or companions! My good buddies!

317
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:35,634
Champ? Chope? Hello? Chang and Chomp!

318
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:38,136
Where are those stupid ducks?

319
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:42,015
Oh, hey! There you guys are.

320
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:45,978
We totally got off on the wrong foot.
I forgive you.

321
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:47,145
Come on. Let's go.

322
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,773
We don't talk to strangers.

323
00:19:49,857 --> 00:19:53,443
What? Strangers?
But, no, but it's me!

324
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:55,112
Me? Who's me?

325
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:58,240
It's me, Peng, the good-looking goose!

326
00:19:58,323 --> 00:20:01,410
Mmm, nope! We don't know
anyone by that name.

327
00:20:01,493 --> 00:20:03,579
Yeah. Looks like we haven't
been introduced.

328
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:08,125
Look. I'm the one you were calling...

329
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,630
Mommy.

330
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:18,260
Mommy!

331
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:20,929
- All right! Okay! Great.
- Something doesn't smell right.

332
00:20:21,013 --> 00:20:22,347
Maybe that's your brother.

333
00:20:22,431 --> 00:20:25,225
Oh, what-- No!
Who treats their mother this way?

334
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:27,185
Why are you helping us all of a sudden?

335
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:28,896
Why?

336
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:33,901
Because I'm doing it
from the bottom of my heart, okay?

337
00:20:35,152 --> 00:20:39,990
Okay, fine, fine. If you don't
want my help, you know, just off you go.

338
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:43,035
See if I care. You know,
if you want to be eaten by monsters.

339
00:20:43,118 --> 00:20:45,412
Chomp, chomp, says the monster.

340
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:48,540
Chi! He's doing it
from the heart of his bottom.

341
00:20:48,624 --> 00:20:51,168
That's right!
That's just the kind of goose I am.

342
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:54,588
I've always gone around helping people.
Trying to do the right thing.

343
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:58,091
You know, maybe help
a couple of ducklings that are lost

344
00:20:58,175 --> 00:21:01,345
and they just want to
find their way back to their flock

345
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:05,849
and maybe put a little piece of
the burden of the world on my shoulders.

346
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:07,768
Ooh! Mom. Can I ride on your shoulders?

347
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:11,521
Not a chance. Get off me.
Ugh. Whew. Let's go.

348
00:21:12,898 --> 00:21:14,858
Come on, let's pick up the pace!

349
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:18,946
Wait! Okay, would you wait up?

350
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:22,866
Just because you're helping us,
does not make you the boss of us.

351
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,077
What? Yes, it-- Yes, it does.

352
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,789
And since I'm the boss,
you're gonna have to go by my rules.

353
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:30,791
Well, I'm just spit-balling here.

354
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:33,877
Rule number one: uh, whatever I say, goes.

355
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:36,046
Goes where?

356
00:21:38,966 --> 00:21:43,470
Okay, I-- You know what, rule number two:
No questions about rule number one.

357
00:21:43,553 --> 00:21:44,471
Okay, Mom.

358
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:46,014
All right, rule number three:

359
00:21:46,098 --> 00:21:50,519
Don't call me mommy, mom, mama,
mama-mia, mother--

360
00:21:50,602 --> 00:21:52,938
Anything that starts with "M." You got it?

361
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:56,692
- Got it, jerk feathers. Any more rules?
- Yes!

362
00:21:56,775 --> 00:22:00,070
Rule number four: We walk fast.
There's no whining or complaining.

363
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:06,201
Eyes are front all the time.
And most of all, never ever wander off.

364
00:22:06,284 --> 00:22:08,495
- Ugh, you are so stupid.
- No, you're stupid.

365
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:10,288
- Stupid infinity.
- You're stupider.

366
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:13,125
- Stupid sounding. Stupid, stupid.
- Well, you know what?

367
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:16,878
You're stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid,
multiplied by stupid.

368
00:22:16,962 --> 00:22:18,880
- Okay, that was stupid.
- Well, at least I'm not a duck.

369
00:22:18,964 --> 00:22:22,217
- What is that supposed to mean?
- You know what it-- Where's Chao?

370
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,720
- He wandered off.
- Are you kidding?

371
00:22:26,972 --> 00:22:31,560
Oh, I'm making some really good time here!

372
00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:35,397
What's that?

373
00:22:35,897 --> 00:22:38,608
What the--

374
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:42,237
Oh!

375
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,489
Ah! It's a monster!

376
00:22:48,744 --> 00:22:51,621
Hey, didn't you just die?

377
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,542
Yuck, that's disgusting!

378
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:59,838
I'm a cat, you idiot.
I have nine lives.

379
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:02,716
Well, now you got eight.

380
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:07,804
Now then, down to business,
where did the goose go?

381
00:23:09,931 --> 00:23:14,269
Peng's my friend.
I'll take that information to the grave!

382
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:15,687
- Okay.
- Wha-- Oh!

383
00:23:15,771 --> 00:23:19,441
Uh, Peng hurt his wing,
so he has to walk to the haven.

384
00:23:20,525 --> 00:23:22,027
He can't fly?

385
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:28,992
The goose can't fly?

386
00:23:29,076 --> 00:23:30,619
He's a dead duck.

387
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:31,787
Goose, actually.

388
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,580
Why, this means...

389
00:23:33,663 --> 00:23:38,585
Stir the plum sauce, boys.
We're having Peking Goose tonight.

390
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:45,258
Remember this meeting. I'm sure I will.
I've got turtle recall.

391
00:23:45,342 --> 00:23:47,636
"Turtle recall." That was a good one.

392
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:48,762
Why, thank you.

393
00:23:48,845 --> 00:23:50,388
- Don't mention it. Never mind.
- Mention what?

394
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:53,308
Oh, this isn't good.
I have to warn Peng right away.

395
00:23:54,935 --> 00:23:57,312
Time to kick it into overdrive.

396
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:07,072
What a show-off!

397
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:20,418
Jeez! You know,
you didn't have to tie him up.

398
00:24:20,502 --> 00:24:22,796
Listen, I have to catch up with my--

399
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:26,091
I mean, uh, we have to catch up
with your flock.

400
00:24:26,174 --> 00:24:30,011
And the little funny face
wandering off all the time

401
00:24:30,095 --> 00:24:32,764
is slowing me-- I mean us down.

402
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:39,146
See? Treat him with respect,
he behaves with-- What?

403
00:24:39,563 --> 00:24:43,608
In case you have poor vision,
his face is funny...

404
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,323
Come on! Let's go.

405
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:54,619
Okay, new plan.

406
00:24:54,703 --> 00:24:56,746
New plan?
I didn't know we had an old plan.

407
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,916
What?

408
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:09,342
We'll cut across country
and join the road further down.

409
00:25:09,426 --> 00:25:10,802
But we'll be going the wrong way.

410
00:25:10,886 --> 00:25:12,679
We may be going the wrong way,

411
00:25:12,762 --> 00:25:14,973
but we'll be headed
in the right direction.

412
00:25:15,056 --> 00:25:17,142
What are you even saying?
That makes no sense.

413
00:25:17,225 --> 00:25:21,104
Look, I'm a migrating goose.
I have excellent instincts.

414
00:25:21,188 --> 00:25:25,025
So, from here on out,
we're gonna travel as the crow flies.

415
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:29,154
But we can't fly!

416
00:25:29,237 --> 00:25:32,449
No, no, no. I mean as the crow flies.

417
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:38,038
It's a way of saying--
Look, it's just a saying, okay?

418
00:25:38,747 --> 00:25:41,333
Hey, Mr. Shortcuts.

419
00:25:48,256 --> 00:25:52,344
What is it now?
What could possibly be wrong now?

420
00:25:54,554 --> 00:25:56,389
Yeah. Rice paddies.

421
00:26:03,188 --> 00:26:06,107
Okay, flocks, remember to fly
straight and steady.

422
00:26:06,191 --> 00:26:08,151
Fly into the cloud and not around it.

423
00:26:08,235 --> 00:26:09,653
If you should get hit by lightning,

424
00:26:09,736 --> 00:26:13,323
the correct procedure is to fall
out of the sky while gently smoking.

425
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:21,289
Hey, honey, you look like you've got
something on your mind? What's going on?

426
00:26:21,373 --> 00:26:23,708
Sorry, Dad, I'm just worried about Peng.

427
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:26,336
Ah, JJ, how can I reassure you?

428
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:29,005
Don't feel bad that you couldn't
persuade him to come.

429
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:32,467
He'll hunker down and we'll see him
next spring. For sure.

430
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:35,178
Yes. Yes. Good.
You know what, you're right.

431
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:36,554
Of course, he'll be long dead by then.

432
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:39,432
- What? Dead?
- Mummified skeleton probably, uh...

433
00:26:39,516 --> 00:26:40,517
but we'll see him is the point.

434
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,476
What?

435
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:43,436
If the foxes don't get to his bones first.

436
00:26:44,062 --> 00:26:46,064
Did you just say foxes? What?

437
00:26:46,147 --> 00:26:49,734
He'll be fine.
He knows what he's doing.

438
00:26:49,818 --> 00:26:52,070
You have no idea
what you're doing, do you?

439
00:26:52,153 --> 00:26:54,864
Come on.
All right, where's your sense of fun?

440
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:57,867
It'll be a hop, skip,
and a jump.

441
00:26:57,951 --> 00:26:59,953
Fun! Yeah, right!

442
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:02,580
Wait! What are you doing? What are you--

443
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:04,666
No! Put me down. Put me down, right now!

444
00:27:04,749 --> 00:27:05,959
Okay, as you wish.

445
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:07,585
No, no, no!

446
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:09,087
Wait? You're not coming?

447
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:11,881
No way,
that thing looks dangerous.

448
00:27:11,965 --> 00:27:13,049
Ahh!

449
00:27:15,135 --> 00:27:16,678
Oh, no! Oh, no!

450
00:27:16,761 --> 00:27:18,722
- Watch out!
- Whoo!

451
00:27:19,764 --> 00:27:21,725
I don't want to die!

452
00:27:33,695 --> 00:27:37,198
Come on, you guys, not the eyes!
I want to see where I'm going!

453
00:27:37,282 --> 00:27:40,285
I don't want to see!
I don't want to--

454
00:27:42,579 --> 00:27:44,956
Whew. That wasn't that bad.

455
00:27:57,427 --> 00:28:00,638
That was so much fun!

456
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:05,518
Fun? Hey, I know, let's do it again.

457
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:07,729
You just don't get it, do you?

458
00:28:07,812 --> 00:28:08,938
- Get what?
- Fun.

459
00:28:09,022 --> 00:28:11,858
Fun? I'm fun. Okay?

460
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:15,820
I invented fun, all right?
My middle name is fun.

461
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:20,742
Before you two came along,
I was Mr. Fun. I'm fun!

462
00:28:20,825 --> 00:28:25,372
You're gonna lecture me on fun?
Two ducklings, sixteen days old?

463
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:26,873
What kind of ridiculous-- Ow!

464
00:28:26,956 --> 00:28:30,210
Now that was fun.

465
00:28:34,714 --> 00:28:38,468
I'm so tired. Are we there yet?

466
00:28:38,885 --> 00:28:40,345
It's raining.

467
00:28:40,428 --> 00:28:42,931
You're ducks, you live in water.

468
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:45,600
Never mind.

469
00:28:47,268 --> 00:28:48,269
Come on!

470
00:28:48,353 --> 00:28:50,397
Whoa!

471
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,690
That was close. Huh?

472
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:56,361
What? Where-- Look, guys, I'm tired.

473
00:28:56,444 --> 00:29:01,699
My feet feel like lead and--
What are you doing down there?

474
00:29:02,784 --> 00:29:05,078
Oh, for Pete's sake,
it's just a little thun--

475
00:29:07,455 --> 00:29:12,377
Barn! Yep, I see a barn.
There's a barn. Barn ahead.

476
00:29:31,229 --> 00:29:33,982
Just gotta...

477
00:29:34,065 --> 00:29:37,986
Oh, hi, uh,
would it be okay if I--

478
00:29:38,069 --> 00:29:40,363
I mean, these two orphan ducks

479
00:29:40,447 --> 00:29:43,700
stayed in your barn for tonight,
couple hours? Thanks.

480
00:29:43,783 --> 00:29:48,246
Absolutely not!
This is for chickens, not waterfowl and--

481
00:29:48,329 --> 00:29:50,707
Stanley, what's happening? Who's there?

482
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:53,418
Uh, nothing dear.
Just dealing with it.

483
00:29:53,501 --> 00:29:55,086
Just dealing with what?

484
00:29:55,170 --> 00:30:00,383
Oh! You look exhausted!
Do come in, little sweet peas.

485
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:03,344
- Oh, Edna will take care of you.
- But my darling.

486
00:30:03,428 --> 00:30:04,846
- I really do think--
- Zip it, Stanley.

487
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:06,681
I lay the eggs around here.

488
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:13,897
Uh, um, hi. Yeah, um--
Well, you know, I'm...

489
00:30:15,064 --> 00:30:18,193
I'm with them.
I'm their legal guardian so I have to--

490
00:30:18,276 --> 00:30:19,486
Stanley!

491
00:30:19,569 --> 00:30:21,613
Who am I kidding?
I'm completely chicken-whipped.

492
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:24,699
Why not just roll me in bread crumbs
and serve me for dinner?

493
00:30:25,408 --> 00:30:28,828
Now, you should be comfortable.
I put down fresh straw.

494
00:30:28,912 --> 00:30:33,666
Good night, my dears. Sleep tight.
Don't let the bed bugs bite.

495
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,127
Goodnight, little ones!

496
00:30:40,757 --> 00:30:42,759
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Go find your own bed.

497
00:30:42,842 --> 00:30:44,219
Over there somewhere.

498
00:30:46,387 --> 00:30:48,681
Ah! Piders! I hate piders.

499
00:30:48,765 --> 00:30:50,099
Now you've done it!

500
00:30:50,183 --> 00:30:52,894
They're delicious. Now go to sleep.

501
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,190
I'm... I'm scared.

502
00:30:57,273 --> 00:31:00,693
Why don't you tell him a story?
That usually works.

503
00:31:00,777 --> 00:31:04,572
I-- Stories? Why would I--
You tell him one.

504
00:31:04,656 --> 00:31:07,283
For goodness' sake, man!
Just tell him something

505
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:09,202
- so we can all get some sleep!
- Stanley, stop fussing!

506
00:31:09,285 --> 00:31:13,915
Will you go to sleep if I do this?

507
00:31:18,336 --> 00:31:21,422
Okay, one story coming up.

508
00:31:21,506 --> 00:31:26,344
Um, once upon a time there were, um,
there were these...

509
00:31:30,848 --> 00:31:34,102
Ducklings. Uh, two--
Yeah, two little guys!

510
00:31:34,185 --> 00:31:36,271
Ooh, ooh, ooh! Are we the ducklings?

511
00:31:36,354 --> 00:31:37,855
I am not a guy.

512
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:39,983
That-- That's not the--

513
00:31:42,443 --> 00:31:49,284
It doesn't matter. One boy, one girl
duckling were, um, they were lost.

514
00:31:49,367 --> 00:31:54,539
In the-- In the fog.
They were lost in the thick murky fog,

515
00:31:55,081 --> 00:32:00,044
and it was so dense they couldn't see
an inch in front of their faces.

516
00:32:00,128 --> 00:32:02,088
We're never gonna
find our way out of this.

517
00:32:02,422 --> 00:32:03,631
We'll have to cross the river.

518
00:32:03,715 --> 00:32:06,634
But that's not safe either, is it?

519
00:32:06,718 --> 00:32:08,803
Well, it's better than this. Come on.

520
00:32:09,345 --> 00:32:10,388
But, but...

521
00:32:10,471 --> 00:32:12,599
But why do they need to cross the river?

522
00:32:12,682 --> 00:32:17,520
To get to the other side? No.
You know because, um, because--

523
00:32:17,604 --> 00:32:19,564
Because if they don't, we'll never--

524
00:32:19,647 --> 00:32:22,275
Never get to sleep. I know. Um...

525
00:32:22,358 --> 00:32:24,777
I have a good mind
to show them all who's--

526
00:32:24,861 --> 00:32:26,487
- Stanley!
- Ah, yes, darling.

527
00:32:26,821 --> 00:32:28,906
So, they started out okay.

528
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:31,492
But I don't-- I don't want to, Chi.
I'm afraid.

529
00:32:31,576 --> 00:32:33,786
Come on. It'll be okay.

530
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:38,166
<i>But they must have been halfway
across when there was a noise ahead.</i>

531
00:32:40,585 --> 00:32:45,465
<i>A swishing, swirling noise,
like nothing they'd ever heard before.</i>

532
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:51,554
Gah-loop. Gah-loop. Gah-loop.

533
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:53,723
I don't like it. Let's go back.

534
00:32:53,806 --> 00:32:54,682
Yeah.

535
00:32:54,766 --> 00:32:58,478
<i>Chi and Chao turned around,
but the mist is even thicker.</i>

536
00:32:59,062 --> 00:33:02,190
<i>There's no going back and they know it.</i>

537
00:33:03,691 --> 00:33:06,944
Then, the sound again. Gah-loop!

538
00:33:07,028 --> 00:33:10,073
The swishing, gah-loop,
on the still, black water

539
00:33:10,156 --> 00:33:15,536
is getting closer, gah-loop.
And closer, gah-loop. And closer, until...

540
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:22,585
<i>The terrible, pale, featureless thing,
rose slowly up before them and--</i>

541
00:33:35,264 --> 00:33:37,809
You have, uh, zero parenting skills.

542
00:33:37,892 --> 00:33:40,061
What? But you guys told me--

543
00:33:40,144 --> 00:33:43,523
How was I supposed to know
he was gonna be a baby about it?

544
00:33:43,606 --> 00:33:47,235
Come here, you two. Come on.
Come to Edna, my dears.

545
00:33:48,986 --> 00:33:51,155
You are not my brand of bird.

546
00:33:51,239 --> 00:33:52,740
Fine. I can't win.

547
00:33:52,824 --> 00:33:56,869
I didn't even want to tell a story
in the first place, stupid chickens.

548
00:33:56,953 --> 00:34:00,331
Monsters.
There's no such thing as monsters.

549
00:34:06,796 --> 00:34:11,634
They're down there somewhere.
Can't you feel it?

550
00:34:11,718 --> 00:34:15,972
Yes, yes.
The atmosphere is positively electric.

551
00:34:21,477 --> 00:34:24,397
Did you have to say that? Ahh!

552
00:34:32,029 --> 00:34:34,574
Monsters.

553
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,121
New plan. They'll be fine here.

554
00:34:40,997 --> 00:34:46,836
Okay. Uh, not too bad.
I should be able to fly.

555
00:34:49,714 --> 00:34:53,009
Not now, Stanley.
Not in front of the eggs.

556
00:35:04,061 --> 00:35:06,773
Those are my nuggets.

557
00:35:14,572 --> 00:35:15,990
No! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

558
00:35:27,502 --> 00:35:29,170
What the--

559
00:35:39,055 --> 00:35:39,889
Shh!

560
00:35:42,183 --> 00:35:45,853
Will you quit it?
Look, they'll be better off without me.

561
00:35:46,145 --> 00:35:46,979
Liar!

562
00:35:47,063 --> 00:35:50,107
Don't judge me!
I'm doing the best I can here.

563
00:35:50,399 --> 00:35:51,234
Liar!

564
00:35:51,317 --> 00:35:54,278
They're slowing me down!
It's not like I promised them anything.

565
00:35:54,362 --> 00:35:55,571
Pants on fire!

566
00:36:00,868 --> 00:36:01,744
That'll teach you.

567
00:36:01,828 --> 00:36:04,080
Liar. Liar. Liar. Liar. Liar. Liar.

568
00:36:04,622 --> 00:36:08,167
Oh! I'm out of here! Ow! That hurt.

569
00:36:08,251 --> 00:36:09,877
Uh, what are you doing?

570
00:36:09,961 --> 00:36:12,129
Oh, hi. Hey!

571
00:36:12,213 --> 00:36:17,218
Uh, uh, I'm not doing anything.
Just, um, you know, a little Tai Chi.

572
00:36:17,301 --> 00:36:20,638
You know, limbering up,
uh, you know, a little stretching.

573
00:36:21,347 --> 00:36:26,269
You want to Tai Chi? Or Tai Chao?
Yeah! Feels great!

574
00:36:28,104 --> 00:36:32,733
Got a big day ahead of us,
so, um, let's go. Let's get a move on.

575
00:36:34,318 --> 00:36:36,821
What's for breakfast?

576
00:36:36,904 --> 00:36:38,072
Come on, Chao.

577
00:36:38,155 --> 00:36:40,825
I really hope he grows up soon.

578
00:36:40,908 --> 00:36:43,578
But, the little duck
is just tired my dear.

579
00:36:43,661 --> 00:36:45,830
I was talking about the goose, Stanley.

580
00:36:48,499 --> 00:36:54,005
Um, hello, Goosey McGooseface.
My brother is really hungry.

581
00:36:54,088 --> 00:36:55,882
So? He can eat when we get there.

582
00:36:55,965 --> 00:36:59,176
You have no idea what you're in store for.

583
00:37:00,511 --> 00:37:05,600
No. No. No. Leave me alone!

584
00:37:06,309 --> 00:37:12,732
Holy moly! Jeez! What the heck is-- Ow!

585
00:37:14,275 --> 00:37:16,485
You didn't tell me about this.
He's gone completely nuts.

586
00:37:16,569 --> 00:37:18,779
What are we supposed to do?

587
00:37:19,113 --> 00:37:22,325
Hey there, little fella, feeling better?

588
00:37:22,408 --> 00:37:25,703
I must have food right now.

589
00:37:28,164 --> 00:37:31,208
Okay. Not good. Not good at all.
Hold on, little bro.

590
00:37:31,292 --> 00:37:32,501
Food now!

591
00:37:32,585 --> 00:37:34,128
Where the heck are you supposed to find...

592
00:37:37,256 --> 00:37:38,341
What do you think?

593
00:37:38,424 --> 00:37:42,887
No, no. I don't like it!

594
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:44,013
Better?

595
00:37:45,139 --> 00:37:47,850
- No!
- Uh, uh...

596
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:54,815
Here you go, kid.

597
00:37:55,274 --> 00:37:57,777
No!

598
00:37:59,487 --> 00:38:01,238
Whoa! Finally.

599
00:38:04,283 --> 00:38:06,827
Ahh!

600
00:38:06,911 --> 00:38:09,080
What is that? That's disgusting!

601
00:38:09,163 --> 00:38:13,042
I hate it. I hate it. I hate it.
It's yucky!

602
00:38:15,294 --> 00:38:17,129
I don't like it!

603
00:38:17,213 --> 00:38:18,381
Here you go, buddy.

604
00:38:20,424 --> 00:38:21,550
Whew!

605
00:38:22,051 --> 00:38:23,636
Come on, Peng, let's go.

606
00:38:31,394 --> 00:38:35,982
Now, chicken, tell me again,
where did the goose go?

607
00:38:36,065 --> 00:38:38,109
You have no right to--

608
00:38:38,192 --> 00:38:42,989
Shush, my dear.
You'll wake the baby.

609
00:38:43,072 --> 00:38:46,784
What was his name again?
Oh, yes, that's right...

610
00:38:46,867 --> 00:38:48,911
I think his name is breakfast.

611
00:38:48,995 --> 00:38:51,497
Breakfast?
I'll give you breakfast you--

612
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:55,167
Put Andrew down right now!

613
00:38:55,251 --> 00:38:57,712
Stanley! My hero!

614
00:39:00,297 --> 00:39:03,050
Oh! Ooh! Ooh!

615
00:39:07,722 --> 00:39:09,974
Which way did they go?

616
00:39:11,267 --> 00:39:13,436
That way.

617
00:39:18,899 --> 00:39:21,944
Can't you guys walk any faster?

618
00:39:22,528 --> 00:39:26,282
Wait, where's Chao?
He wandered off again, didn't he?

619
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:30,036
What's the matter with him now?

620
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:32,663
He thinks your gonna leave him behind.
He's frightened.

621
00:39:32,747 --> 00:39:36,709
Why would he think that?
I mean that's crazy.

622
00:39:38,127 --> 00:39:41,756
Look, you know what geese do
when they need help?

623
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:43,049
- Uh-uh.
- They honk.

624
00:39:43,132 --> 00:39:45,676
All you have to do
is take a lung full of air...

625
00:39:46,677 --> 00:39:50,139
then let it all out in one blast,
like this.

626
00:39:53,142 --> 00:39:56,062
Wow. You've got some mad skills.

627
00:39:56,145 --> 00:39:58,481
Ah. Ah. Ah.

628
00:39:58,564 --> 00:39:59,607
See, it's simple.

629
00:40:05,029 --> 00:40:06,363
Shh!

630
00:40:10,993 --> 00:40:11,952
Follow me.

631
00:40:15,873 --> 00:40:17,124
Wait.

632
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:21,128
What do you think you're doing?
Wait. Not in here.

633
00:40:21,212 --> 00:40:23,214
Ow. Ouch.

634
00:40:23,297 --> 00:40:24,924
Sorry. Sorry.

635
00:40:25,007 --> 00:40:27,676
Someone help!
He's stealing my bike! Give it back to me!

636
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,178
Whoops! My bad! Sorry!

637
00:40:30,304 --> 00:40:32,556
Huh?

638
00:40:32,932 --> 00:40:35,810
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

639
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,063
That wasn't that bad.

640
00:40:43,067 --> 00:40:44,401
Stop it!

641
00:40:44,485 --> 00:40:46,612
- Whoa! Ow. Ow. Ah.
- Whoa! Look out!

642
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:49,615
Whoa!

643
00:40:55,329 --> 00:40:56,622
Look out!

644
00:40:57,706 --> 00:41:00,626
Whoa, that is not a good look!

645
00:41:10,553 --> 00:41:11,971
Ow!

646
00:41:15,266 --> 00:41:17,393
Yuck!

647
00:41:19,478 --> 00:41:20,855
Whoa!

648
00:41:21,105 --> 00:41:23,774
No, no, no, no.

649
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:26,986
That was close.

650
00:41:27,069 --> 00:41:29,738
Ew.

651
00:41:33,909 --> 00:41:34,994
Gross!

652
00:41:39,582 --> 00:41:41,167
Whoa.

653
00:41:44,503 --> 00:41:50,467
Oh, no!

654
00:41:50,551 --> 00:41:56,223
I didn't sign up for this!

655
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,898
What? What happened?

656
00:42:03,981 --> 00:42:05,232
Oh, meow.

657
00:42:11,405 --> 00:42:12,239
Great.

658
00:42:20,873 --> 00:42:22,541
Uh-oh. Not again.

659
00:42:27,504 --> 00:42:31,217
It's not funny. I mean--
Okay, it's pretty funny.

660
00:42:48,651 --> 00:42:50,694
Oh, great. Now what?

661
00:42:50,778 --> 00:42:56,951
What? That's just a wall, we just walk
around it. I mean, how long can it be?

662
00:42:57,034 --> 00:42:59,703
Yeah, about that...

663
00:43:15,761 --> 00:43:17,805
Are you asleep?

664
00:43:19,223 --> 00:43:21,850
Are you asleep?

665
00:43:36,573 --> 00:43:37,491
Is he okay?

666
00:43:37,574 --> 00:43:41,412
Hmm, I don't know. Sounds like
he's gonna lay an egg or something.

667
00:43:45,958 --> 00:43:48,961
Who would do that? What--

668
00:43:49,044 --> 00:43:54,383
Chao, stop that!
There might be spiders in there.

669
00:43:54,466 --> 00:43:56,885
Piders? I don't see any piders.

670
00:43:56,969 --> 00:43:58,512
Shh.

671
00:44:00,055 --> 00:44:03,976
I can't wait to fly again.

672
00:44:04,059 --> 00:44:05,227
What's it like?

673
00:44:05,311 --> 00:44:10,441
What, flying? Well, I mean, when you're
up there, it's just you and the clouds.

674
00:44:10,524 --> 00:44:15,654
There's nothing like it.
It is complete freedom.

675
00:44:15,738 --> 00:44:18,449
And no-one's got their feathers
in my beak holes.

676
00:44:20,451 --> 00:44:21,827
What?

677
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:23,495
I hope I get to fly someday.

678
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:25,706
Of course you will. Why wouldn't you?

679
00:44:25,789 --> 00:44:28,584
Well, everyone said we wouldn't
need to in Pleasant Valley.

680
00:44:28,667 --> 00:44:30,169
Wha-- Pleasant Valley?

681
00:44:30,252 --> 00:44:34,465
Well, yeah, that's where we were going
until someone ran into us.

682
00:44:34,882 --> 00:44:40,054
They say it's a peaceful place
where only the best ducks go.

683
00:44:40,137 --> 00:44:42,014
Ow. Ow, ow! I hurt my head.

684
00:44:42,097 --> 00:44:43,349
- Anybody there? Hello!
- Well, Chi,

685
00:44:43,432 --> 00:44:45,934
I don't know how peaceful it's going to be
with Chao around.

686
00:44:46,018 --> 00:44:49,938
Hey, you must have lots
of brothers and sisters?

687
00:44:50,022 --> 00:44:53,525
Nope. They all got taken.
I was the last egg.

688
00:44:53,609 --> 00:44:57,112
Oh. Well, I'm sorry. That's terrible.

689
00:44:57,196 --> 00:44:59,782
Well, I was too young to know.

690
00:44:59,865 --> 00:45:03,702
Besides, the whole flock is really
my family and--

691
00:45:03,786 --> 00:45:05,329
- What?
- Nah, nothing.

692
00:45:05,412 --> 00:45:10,292
I was just realizing what a jerk I was
to my flock, especially Jinjing.

693
00:45:11,543 --> 00:45:15,589
My girlfriend Jinjing.
I kind of messed things up.

694
00:45:15,672 --> 00:45:17,049
Well, did you apologize?

695
00:45:17,132 --> 00:45:19,343
No, I didn't apologize! Of course not.

696
00:45:19,426 --> 00:45:20,386
Why not?

697
00:45:20,469 --> 00:45:24,723
Because you never apologize!
Apologizing is a sign of weakness.

698
00:45:24,807 --> 00:45:26,016
Well that's just dumb.

699
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:28,310
Plus, if I did she'd-- she'd--

700
00:45:28,394 --> 00:45:31,230
- Be your girlfriend again?
- That's a good point.

701
00:45:31,313 --> 00:45:34,691
Yeah, you're pretty smart.
But you know, you don't know everything.

702
00:45:34,775 --> 00:45:37,611
- Like?
- You don't know how to fly. Come on.

703
00:45:37,694 --> 00:45:40,572
Oh, Peng, no. Really, I'm good.
I don't want to.

704
00:45:40,656 --> 00:45:42,449
- Be quiet and reach out your wings!
- No. No.

705
00:45:42,533 --> 00:45:45,411
Come on. It'll be a hop, skip and a jump.

706
00:45:45,494 --> 00:45:47,830
- Here we go. Come on. Flap. Flap.
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa.

707
00:45:47,913 --> 00:45:49,706
Good, good, good. That's good. Great.

708
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:52,793
- Okay, nice. Oh! Oh, my gosh!
- You're getting it. That's it. You got it.

709
00:45:52,876 --> 00:45:56,255
- Chi, you're a natural.
- I'm flying. I'm really flying, Peng!

710
00:45:56,338 --> 00:45:58,090
Crap. Oh. Oh, no. Ah!

711
00:45:58,173 --> 00:45:59,508
Whoo!

712
00:45:59,591 --> 00:46:01,552
No, no, no! Hey! No! Chao!

713
00:46:01,635 --> 00:46:03,679
Whoa!

714
00:46:05,013 --> 00:46:06,765
Help me, Chi!

715
00:46:06,849 --> 00:46:08,058
I'm really flying!

716
00:46:08,142 --> 00:46:10,477
Ow. Chi, how'd you get up there?

717
00:46:10,561 --> 00:46:11,562
Whoo!

718
00:46:11,645 --> 00:46:13,772
Whoa!

719
00:46:14,898 --> 00:46:16,400
Whoa! Oh, no!

720
00:46:16,483 --> 00:46:18,277
This is crazy! Get out!

721
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:21,697
I can't believe this. We're flying?
We're literately flying! We're doing it!

722
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:25,075
This is so cool! Uh-oh.

723
00:46:29,204 --> 00:46:30,622
Look out!

724
00:46:32,416 --> 00:46:38,797
I'm okay. I'm all right!
Luckily I landed on something soft.

725
00:46:38,881 --> 00:46:41,008
Yeah, us, you nincompoop!

726
00:46:41,091 --> 00:46:43,010
You've got a big butt.

727
00:46:43,093 --> 00:46:45,679
I do not have a big butt.

728
00:46:45,762 --> 00:46:48,056
I just-- I have very thin legs.

729
00:46:48,557 --> 00:46:50,184
Anyway, come on. Let's go.

730
00:46:50,267 --> 00:46:51,768
I know this is all fun and games

731
00:46:51,852 --> 00:46:55,022
but the leaves mean that winter is coming,
so we got to go!

732
00:46:55,105 --> 00:46:59,902
And winter means snow
and snow is not our friend...

733
00:47:00,986 --> 00:47:04,656
Whoa. Brr. All right, that's it.
All right, the games over.

734
00:47:05,032 --> 00:47:07,576
All right, I'm gonna count to three
and if you're not up here--

735
00:47:07,659 --> 00:47:09,244
Well, you don't even want to know.

736
00:47:09,328 --> 00:47:14,041
One. I said one. Two. All right, three!

737
00:47:15,125 --> 00:47:16,919
You little piranhas!

738
00:47:17,002 --> 00:47:23,717
Ha-ha, gotcha!
Looks like you messed with the-- Uh, Chi?

739
00:47:24,968 --> 00:47:26,178
- Yeah?
- Where's Chao?

740
00:47:26,261 --> 00:47:30,265
Ugh, he wandered off. Again.

741
00:47:30,349 --> 00:47:33,936
Outstanding work flock.
We made it to the waypoint with no losses.

742
00:47:34,019 --> 00:47:36,522
Except for Peng that is.
But, uh, we're not giving up yet.

743
00:47:36,605 --> 00:47:38,607
Birds of a feather migrate together!

744
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:40,984
Birds of a feather migrate together.

745
00:47:41,068 --> 00:47:43,570
Never give up!
Peng's never coming back, Jinjing.

746
00:47:43,654 --> 00:47:45,864
- What?
- He, uh... he never deserved you.

747
00:47:45,948 --> 00:47:47,783
Dad, we've talked about this before.

748
00:47:47,866 --> 00:47:50,369
If I may, young lady, uh,
you need a gander who's strong,

749
00:47:50,452 --> 00:47:54,164
accompanied by an infallible intellect,
and a side order of humility.

750
00:47:54,248 --> 00:47:57,918
But a big, big side order.
Someone like, well, someone like your dad.

751
00:47:58,001 --> 00:48:01,421
He is like you, Dad.
That's what I've been trying to tell you!

752
00:48:01,505 --> 00:48:02,923
- He's handsome.
- Handsome.

753
00:48:03,006 --> 00:48:04,466
- He's strong.
- Mm-hmm.

754
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:05,676
Sure he's reckless

755
00:48:05,759 --> 00:48:07,386
- and a bit of a show-off.
- Well...

756
00:48:07,469 --> 00:48:12,099
But deep down underneath
that narcissistic, annoying exterior...

757
00:48:12,182 --> 00:48:14,309
Uh, wait, wait. "Narcissistic"?

758
00:48:14,393 --> 00:48:17,104
I don't know why I like Peng, Dad.
It's weird...

759
00:48:17,187 --> 00:48:18,689
Ah, the heart wants...

760
00:48:18,772 --> 00:48:20,399
What the heart wants.

761
00:48:20,482 --> 00:48:23,318
It's as clear as the beak on my face.

762
00:48:23,402 --> 00:48:26,446
No daughter of mine is saddling up
with that sad excuse for a gander.

763
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:28,907
You just try and stop me, Daddy.

764
00:48:30,659 --> 00:48:32,494
Oh, awkward.

765
00:48:32,995 --> 00:48:33,996
Good afternoon, ladies.

766
00:48:36,456 --> 00:48:38,000
Ladies?

767
00:48:40,711 --> 00:48:43,005
Uh, you don't think he's...

768
00:48:43,088 --> 00:48:44,131
Yeah.

769
00:48:44,214 --> 00:48:45,757
- For reals?
- Totally.

770
00:48:45,841 --> 00:48:46,967
Nah. Really?

771
00:48:48,218 --> 00:48:50,137
Chao!

772
00:48:52,681 --> 00:48:54,308
He's not in there. See?

773
00:48:54,391 --> 00:48:58,604
He's got more sense than to go
into some creepy, dark, scary cave.

774
00:48:58,687 --> 00:49:01,398
This is so cool!

775
00:49:03,275 --> 00:49:04,526
Oh, shoot.

776
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:05,569
Okay, we got to go get him.

777
00:49:05,652 --> 00:49:09,906
Hold up.
Let me present something to you.

778
00:49:12,826 --> 00:49:13,994
How much do you like your brother?

779
00:49:14,077 --> 00:49:16,913
A lot! Okay, I like him a lot.

780
00:49:16,997 --> 00:49:22,836
But what you have to understand is
this is a sub-underground, um, enviro.

781
00:49:22,919 --> 00:49:24,630
I'm used to being above it all.

782
00:49:26,882 --> 00:49:29,343
- Uh, that didn't come out right.
- Mm-hmm.

783
00:49:29,635 --> 00:49:33,555
All right. Fine.
We'll go in and get the little stinker.

784
00:49:39,978 --> 00:49:42,397
No, no, no, no.
It's just we're underground.

785
00:49:42,481 --> 00:49:46,652
It's dark. It's smelly.
Great. We're gonna die.

786
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,738
Chao!

787
00:49:51,365 --> 00:49:52,616
Chi...

788
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:54,618
He's this way.

789
00:49:55,952 --> 00:49:58,330
Not so fast! Wait for me.

790
00:49:58,413 --> 00:50:02,167
Whoa, whoa. I have goosebumps
on my goosebumps

791
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:04,044
and I'm a goose for Pete's sake!

792
00:50:05,504 --> 00:50:08,548
Fine, fine. I'm fine.
Nothing to worry about.

793
00:50:08,632 --> 00:50:09,716
Are you sure?

794
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:12,803
Yep. Ah! What was that?
Something just touched me!

795
00:50:12,886 --> 00:50:14,179
- What is it?
- I don't know.

796
00:50:14,262 --> 00:50:16,139
It's slimy, and smelly, and--

797
00:50:17,015 --> 00:50:19,810
Oh, it's just Chao.

798
00:50:19,893 --> 00:50:22,187
Guys! You've got to come see this!

799
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:26,483
Will you be my buddy?

800
00:50:26,566 --> 00:50:29,861
Wait for me. Ah!

801
00:50:29,945 --> 00:50:31,613
Mommy.

802
00:50:33,365 --> 00:50:34,366
Ow.

803
00:50:37,285 --> 00:50:38,578
Wow.

804
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:44,084
Whoa. It's like-- It's like stars.

805
00:50:45,669 --> 00:50:47,295
I think they're glowworms.

806
00:50:49,172 --> 00:50:54,052
Glowworms? How did--
Well, how do they glow like that?

807
00:50:54,136 --> 00:50:57,389
Well, it's actually two chemicals
reacting in their bellies.

808
00:50:57,472 --> 00:50:59,516
Why would you know that?

809
00:51:01,852 --> 00:51:04,187
Gross! I got to go swim or something.

810
00:51:04,271 --> 00:51:05,439
Spicy!

811
00:51:07,065 --> 00:51:09,484
- Chao, look!
- Oh, it looks like us!

812
00:51:12,654 --> 00:51:14,406
Gotcha!

813
00:51:16,241 --> 00:51:19,161
Oh, Peng, my friend
and I would like to have a word with you.

814
00:51:19,244 --> 00:51:20,620
Hey, I remember them!

815
00:51:20,704 --> 00:51:22,914
Blah, blah, blah.
Goose actually.

816
00:51:22,998 --> 00:51:24,708
I'm a turtle
who sounds like

817
00:51:24,791 --> 00:51:26,835
I have a frog stuck in my throat.

818
00:51:27,294 --> 00:51:28,545
Ribbit.

819
00:51:31,631 --> 00:51:33,300
Wow, that's pretty cool, Chi.

820
00:51:33,383 --> 00:51:34,426
I'm not doing that one.

821
00:51:34,509 --> 00:51:36,178
Huh? Way to go Chao.

822
00:51:36,261 --> 00:51:37,095
That's not me.

823
00:51:37,179 --> 00:51:42,809
Well, if you didn't do it, and he's not
doing it, and I'm definitely not...

824
00:51:42,893 --> 00:51:46,646
All my favorites in one place.

825
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:48,523
Duck, duck, goose.

826
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:49,900
Guys run!

827
00:51:58,074 --> 00:51:59,659
Where'd you guys go?

828
00:51:59,951 --> 00:52:02,871
- Peng? Where are you guys?
- Ow!

829
00:52:04,372 --> 00:52:06,082
- Chi? Where are you?
- Chao, where are you? Peng?

830
00:52:07,584 --> 00:52:10,712
You're dead, goose! You hear me? Dead!

831
00:52:10,796 --> 00:52:13,131
- Peng!
- Peng, we need to go.

832
00:52:13,215 --> 00:52:15,759
The cat. He's gonna get us. He's after us.

833
00:52:15,842 --> 00:52:18,178
Ducklings come out to play.

834
00:52:21,306 --> 00:52:23,433
All right. Which way is out of here?

835
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:25,769
Owie!

836
00:52:26,228 --> 00:52:27,354
What are you doing?

837
00:52:27,437 --> 00:52:28,563
You'll see.

838
00:52:29,481 --> 00:52:31,399
This way. Come on. Hurry!

839
00:52:38,073 --> 00:52:43,453
Oh, little ducklings.
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

840
00:52:45,622 --> 00:52:49,626
This way. Come on. Hurry!
That's the way out.

841
00:52:49,709 --> 00:52:52,838
You can't duck me forever.

842
00:52:52,921 --> 00:52:55,715
Come on, up you go. There. I'm right here.

843
00:52:55,799 --> 00:52:58,176
Keep going, fast as you can.

844
00:52:59,803 --> 00:53:02,764
- I can't do it.
- Yes, you can! Keep going.

845
00:53:02,848 --> 00:53:04,558
Ready or not...

846
00:53:04,641 --> 00:53:07,394
- Come on! Come on!
- We're coming!

847
00:53:07,477 --> 00:53:09,479
Hurry!

848
00:53:24,286 --> 00:53:29,708
Oh! Guys, I have a bad feeling about this.

849
00:53:29,791 --> 00:53:31,501
Whoa!

850
00:53:31,585 --> 00:53:33,211
That was it?

851
00:53:33,295 --> 00:53:35,630
Phew! I thought it was gonna be big--

852
00:53:38,592 --> 00:53:42,262
This is so cool!

853
00:53:51,855 --> 00:53:54,107
Peng!

854
00:53:55,191 --> 00:53:56,985
- I'm dizzy.
- This is so cool!

855
00:53:57,068 --> 00:54:01,281
- Chi! Peng! Come here and swim a bit.
- I need to lie down.

856
00:54:04,576 --> 00:54:05,577
I feel sick.

857
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:07,287
- I don't know what to feel.
- Chi, look at me!

858
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:08,955
Cannonball!

859
00:54:09,539 --> 00:54:12,125
Am I crazy
or is your brother indestructible?

860
00:54:12,208 --> 00:54:13,251
Check this out.

861
00:54:13,335 --> 00:54:15,879
Using air currents,
that was pretty genius.

862
00:54:15,962 --> 00:54:18,798
Yeah, well, uh,
that's a little thing I invented.

863
00:54:18,882 --> 00:54:22,260
I tried to show my flock,
but they weren't ready for it yet.

864
00:54:25,639 --> 00:54:28,558
It's the road! It-- It's the road!
You've found the road!

865
00:54:28,642 --> 00:54:31,019
You did it, Peng! You-- You really did it!

866
00:54:31,102 --> 00:54:35,106
Whoo! Yes! We're going home.

867
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:36,983
All right!

868
00:54:37,067 --> 00:54:41,863
Wow, well, how about that?
I told you I'd get you here, right?

869
00:54:41,947 --> 00:54:43,031
Yeah!

870
00:54:44,491 --> 00:54:47,243
You know, I always trust my instincts.

871
00:54:47,327 --> 00:54:50,205
Now, all we got to do is cross the river,
hit the road,

872
00:54:50,288 --> 00:54:52,248
and I'm sure we'll catch up
with your flock.

873
00:54:54,834 --> 00:54:58,588
- Chi, is Pleasant Valley really home?
- What?

874
00:54:58,672 --> 00:55:01,132
I don't know if I want to go
back to the others now.

875
00:55:01,216 --> 00:55:02,968
Chao, you can't be serious.

876
00:55:03,051 --> 00:55:06,429
Well, we are kind of a family, aren't we?

877
00:55:06,513 --> 00:55:08,640
You've imprinted, haven't you?

878
00:55:08,723 --> 00:55:09,891
I didn't mean to.

879
00:55:14,396 --> 00:55:18,858
My flock! Guys, guys, guys, wait!
Wait for me!

880
00:55:18,942 --> 00:55:22,362
It's me, it's me! Please wait!

881
00:55:22,445 --> 00:55:25,865
All right, flock, time to wander
into the deep blue yonder.

882
00:55:25,949 --> 00:55:27,283
Where's he going?

883
00:55:27,367 --> 00:55:30,161
Peng, Peng! Where you going?

884
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:37,210
No, no, no, please wait!

885
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:42,007
What's up with Peng?

886
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:47,762
I don't know. Uh... Peng. What is it?
What's going on? What's wrong?

887
00:55:47,846 --> 00:55:52,267
What's... What's wrong? Didn't you see?

888
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:55,228
That was my flock.
I could have caught up with them!

889
00:55:55,311 --> 00:55:57,647
But at every turn, you guys slow me down.

890
00:55:57,731 --> 00:56:02,277
How am I gonna get to the haven now?
I should've left you with the pigs.

891
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,446
You were going to leave us?

892
00:56:04,529 --> 00:56:06,990
He was gonna leave us
whenever it suited him, Chao.

893
00:56:07,073 --> 00:56:08,616
I got you to your road, okay!

894
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:12,454
This whole time you weren't helping us.
You were using us.

895
00:56:12,537 --> 00:56:15,832
Yes-- No, not-- At the beginning, I...

896
00:56:15,915 --> 00:56:20,545
I found your road okay? Look, I gotta go.

897
00:56:21,546 --> 00:56:25,133
You know what, Peng, your instincts stink!

898
00:56:26,968 --> 00:56:27,886
Come on, Chao.

899
00:56:34,350 --> 00:56:36,561
Don't go, Mom. Please?

900
00:56:37,562 --> 00:56:40,607
I said come on, Chao. Forget him.

901
00:57:04,047 --> 00:57:06,716
Guys! Guys, wait.

902
00:57:08,301 --> 00:57:11,679
Wait! No!

903
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:15,558
Oh, no! Come back, you guys!

904
00:57:15,642 --> 00:57:16,684
Ahh!

905
00:57:18,019 --> 00:57:23,441
Somebody help! Please come back!

906
00:57:25,693 --> 00:57:26,528
Jinjing?

907
00:57:26,611 --> 00:57:28,780
Incoming!

908
00:57:28,863 --> 00:57:30,198
Ahh!

909
00:57:37,914 --> 00:57:40,500
Ta-da!

910
00:57:40,583 --> 00:57:43,378
Another perfect landing, man.

911
00:57:43,461 --> 00:57:45,839
Wait? Are you a squirrel?

912
00:57:46,214 --> 00:57:49,551
Hey, you know what,
I'm not really into labels, per se.

913
00:57:49,634 --> 00:57:52,762
I find them limiting.
Like, I wouldn't call you a badger.

914
00:57:52,846 --> 00:57:55,223
Well, that's because I'm not a badger.

915
00:57:55,306 --> 00:57:58,852
Yeah, so you see what I'm talking about.
Right on.

916
00:57:59,269 --> 00:58:01,771
Hey, I'm Carl. Bring it in, brah.

917
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:03,648
- Ow.
- Hey, wait a second.

918
00:58:03,982 --> 00:58:08,570
Yes! Definitely picking up on a negative
aura around this general wing area.

919
00:58:08,653 --> 00:58:11,698
Yeah, it's called pain.
I've injured my wing.

920
00:58:11,781 --> 00:58:14,450
Dude! This is your lucky, lucky day.

921
00:58:14,534 --> 00:58:19,706
Lucky for you I am artful
in the ways of healing. Qigong, man.

922
00:58:19,998 --> 00:58:23,042
"Qi" what?
Is that "goodbye" in squirrel or--

923
00:58:23,126 --> 00:58:26,379
Hey, you don't have any cookies, do you?

924
00:58:26,462 --> 00:58:31,551
Cookies? No. Uh, uh-- Go back to the--
Did you say you could fix my wing?

925
00:58:31,634 --> 00:58:33,011
Why? What happened to your wing?

926
00:58:33,344 --> 00:58:36,890
Oh! Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Right.
Your wing. Totally, yes!

927
00:58:36,973 --> 00:58:40,643
Brace yourself,
because this is a four-step process.

928
00:58:40,727 --> 00:58:42,937
First, is stimulation.

929
00:58:43,021 --> 00:58:44,981
Stimulation? Ow! Ooh!

930
00:58:45,064 --> 00:58:47,192
Followed by manipulation.

931
00:58:47,275 --> 00:58:50,153
- Like this!
- What? Wait! Ouch!

932
00:58:50,653 --> 00:58:54,115
Then, a simple case of aggravation.

933
00:58:56,701 --> 00:59:01,497
And finally, the <i>pièce de résistance,</i>
incapacitation.

934
00:59:03,458 --> 00:59:04,834
Goodnight, badger.

935
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:10,965
We're never gonna
find our way through this.

936
00:59:11,466 --> 00:59:12,550
What are we gonna do?

937
00:59:12,634 --> 00:59:15,470
I guess we're just gonna
have to cross the river.

938
00:59:15,553 --> 00:59:17,013
What is it?

939
00:59:17,096 --> 00:59:18,806
This is just like Peng's story.

940
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:22,268
Yeah, well, he's good at making things up.

941
00:59:24,562 --> 00:59:25,897
No, Chi, really.

942
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:27,857
Come on, okay? There's no such thing as--

943
00:59:30,652 --> 00:59:34,155
Monsters. It's just a turtle, right?
It's got to be.

944
00:59:43,248 --> 00:59:47,961
I don't like it. Let's go back.

945
00:59:48,044 --> 00:59:49,379
Yeah.

946
00:59:51,214 --> 00:59:55,176
- Chao, which way is back?
- Um...

947
00:59:55,927 --> 01:00:01,140
Look, Chi! It looks like--
It is! I can see the other side!

948
01:00:07,939 --> 01:00:09,357
Um, Chi...

949
01:00:14,529 --> 01:00:16,281
Badger! You're awake.

950
01:00:16,364 --> 01:00:18,408
What have you done? Why?

951
01:00:18,491 --> 01:00:20,368
Duh! I'm healing your wing, brah.

952
01:00:20,451 --> 01:00:22,370
That's the wrong wing.

953
01:00:22,453 --> 01:00:25,331
Ah. <i>Uno momentito</i>, duder.

954
01:00:25,415 --> 01:00:31,254
All right. Wait...
Did you hear a sheep?

955
01:00:31,337 --> 01:00:34,173
- What? No.
- Neither did I.

956
01:00:34,841 --> 01:00:39,220
What are you doing? Ow!

957
01:00:39,595 --> 01:00:42,140
- Whoa, easy there big guy!
- Ow!

958
01:00:42,223 --> 01:00:45,560
Hey, hey. You got to chill your sticks,
badger. Sit down!

959
01:00:45,643 --> 01:00:47,353
Are you sure this is gonna work?

960
01:00:47,437 --> 01:00:50,106
Ah, no problemo, man. I'm a healer.

961
01:00:50,189 --> 01:00:53,151
It's what I do.
It's worked on all of my buddies.

962
01:00:53,234 --> 01:00:58,614
Your buddies? Oh, so you're--
you're not the only squirrel up here then?

963
01:00:58,990 --> 01:01:02,952
Squirrels? Oh, man! Squirrels?

964
01:01:04,537 --> 01:01:09,000
Man. Oh, these--
Oh, these aren't squirrels. Are you crazy?

965
01:01:10,335 --> 01:01:12,295
Squirrels.

966
01:01:12,378 --> 01:01:17,216
Yeah, there used to be a whole
bunch of us, flying around, having fun.

967
01:01:17,550 --> 01:01:19,302
But then they left.

968
01:01:19,385 --> 01:01:21,095
Oh, really? I wonder why.

969
01:01:21,179 --> 01:01:24,140
Oh, you know, they met girls,
started families.

970
01:01:24,891 --> 01:01:26,893
Can you believe
they did that to me?

971
01:01:26,976 --> 01:01:27,852
Surprising.

972
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:29,354
I said to my friend Rocky, I was like,

973
01:01:29,437 --> 01:01:32,231
"Hey, Rocky, yeah,
great for you and the moose,

974
01:01:32,732 --> 01:01:35,526
but now what am I gonna do
on Tuesday nights, huh?"

975
01:01:35,610 --> 01:01:37,528
Can't imagine why they'd leave.

976
01:01:37,612 --> 01:01:39,572
That's what I said!

977
01:01:39,989 --> 01:01:42,450
Well, now they're all miserable
with their kids.

978
01:01:42,533 --> 01:01:43,409
They are?

979
01:01:43,493 --> 01:01:47,288
Well, you know... I mean,
they say they're happy, but come on.

980
01:01:47,372 --> 01:01:50,833
All kids do is eat,
poop and complain. Right?

981
01:01:50,917 --> 01:01:53,586
Yeah, you got that right.

982
01:01:54,796 --> 01:01:57,757
Ugh, that burns me nose hairs.

983
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:01,302
Ah! What the--
This is nuts, I got to get-- It's--

984
01:02:01,386 --> 01:02:04,263
Forget the kids.
I gotta get to the haven.

985
01:02:04,347 --> 01:02:07,058
What? Hold the mayo, man!

986
01:02:07,141 --> 01:02:10,603
You live in the Spa?
Oh! Hey, you think you can get me in?

987
01:02:10,686 --> 01:02:14,190
Uh, you? Well, I can-- I--
You know, why not? All right, fine.

988
01:02:14,273 --> 01:02:18,361
Yeah, man, that's awesome.

989
01:02:18,444 --> 01:02:23,491
You know the winters up here can be
so gnarly. Like last year, my nuts froze.

990
01:02:24,325 --> 01:02:26,661
- Huh?
- Wait. What kids?

991
01:02:31,332 --> 01:02:35,294
All right, it's okay!
We're fine. Everything's fine.

992
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:01,737
Carl, I don't get this. How is hanging
from a branch supposed to heal me?

993
01:03:01,821 --> 01:03:05,241
Dude, just reach out your arms
like they're wings and--

994
01:03:05,324 --> 01:03:07,827
What do you mean "like wings,"
they are wings.

995
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:10,872
Oh, pretend you haven't got any,
then pretend you do.

996
01:03:10,955 --> 01:03:12,874
Then let go of the branch.

997
01:03:12,957 --> 01:03:17,879
Let go? Carl, I can't fly. Remember?
My wing is totally messed up.

998
01:03:17,962 --> 01:03:21,257
Dude, flying is all about taking the leap.

999
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:23,092
I know what flying is, Carl.

1000
01:03:23,176 --> 01:03:25,595
It's the falling I'm worried about.

1001
01:03:25,678 --> 01:03:28,389
No, it's the hitting the ground
I'm worried about.

1002
01:03:28,473 --> 01:03:30,433
Slow your roll, Mr. Worry Nuts.

1003
01:03:30,516 --> 01:03:33,186
What could go wrong?
You're tied to that rope.

1004
01:03:33,269 --> 01:03:36,981
Dude, it's all mental.
Except for the physical part.

1005
01:03:37,982 --> 01:03:40,443
Okay, Peng, you can do this.

1006
01:03:40,985 --> 01:03:45,823
Here we go. One... Two...

1007
01:03:46,282 --> 01:03:49,035
Three!

1008
01:03:50,995 --> 01:03:53,998
Whoo-hoo! Leap of faith, man!

1009
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:58,628
Oh! Bummer.

1010
01:04:08,221 --> 01:04:11,974
Whoo-hoo! This is awesome.

1011
01:04:12,808 --> 01:04:17,188
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.

1012
01:04:17,271 --> 01:04:19,857
Whoa! You're flying like a badger, badger.

1013
01:04:19,941 --> 01:04:25,404
Whoo! I'm flying, Carl!
I'm flying.

1014
01:04:26,614 --> 01:04:30,785
<i>Oh! Oh my gosh, I'm flying!
I'm really flying, Peng.</i>

1015
01:04:30,868 --> 01:04:32,578
<i>This is so cool!</i>

1016
01:04:33,496 --> 01:04:36,499
Hey! That's the wrong way, man!

1017
01:04:36,582 --> 01:04:40,086
Yes, but I'm headed
in the right direction.

1018
01:04:55,309 --> 01:04:57,353
Chao! Hey, Chao, Chao, Chao!
Quick. Come and see!

1019
01:05:06,237 --> 01:05:08,239
Go, go, go. Good boys.

1020
01:05:08,614 --> 01:05:11,033
It's so good to see you guys!
We got separated--

1021
01:05:40,146 --> 01:05:41,022
Wow!

1022
01:05:42,356 --> 01:05:44,233
Come along. Go, go.

1023
01:05:49,655 --> 01:05:51,449
Go, go, go.
This way, this way.

1024
01:05:52,199 --> 01:05:53,743
Does this seem right to you?

1025
01:05:53,826 --> 01:05:56,787
Come on. It's got to be
the way to Pleasant Valley.

1026
01:05:57,705 --> 01:05:59,707
Uh, I don't think so.

1027
01:06:03,044 --> 01:06:04,587
Go, go, go.

1028
01:06:08,924 --> 01:06:11,135
Oh, no!

1029
01:06:11,218 --> 01:06:12,303
Whoa!

1030
01:06:15,473 --> 01:06:18,351
This wouldn't have
happened if we'd just stayed with Peng.

1031
01:06:18,434 --> 01:06:21,437
You've got to be kidding me!
He didn't care about us.

1032
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:22,355
Yes, he did!

1033
01:06:22,438 --> 01:06:25,608
He was great and he was funny
and he took care of us.

1034
01:06:26,275 --> 01:06:28,194
He wouldn't have gone away
if you hadn't been so mean.

1035
01:06:28,277 --> 01:06:30,404
Mean? I was trying to protect you.

1036
01:06:30,488 --> 01:06:32,323
And I wouldn't have had to
if you weren't such a big baby!

1037
01:06:32,406 --> 01:06:34,367
You think you're looking after me,
but you're not!

1038
01:06:34,450 --> 01:06:37,703
Pleasant Valley isn't even real,
and you're not my mom.

1039
01:06:37,787 --> 01:06:40,873
Well, maybe I'm not, but right now
I'm all you've got.

1040
01:06:40,956 --> 01:06:44,710
No! No, no, no. Let them go!

1041
01:07:30,715 --> 01:07:32,925
Huh? No.

1042
01:07:40,516 --> 01:07:41,517
- Chi.
- Yeah?

1043
01:07:41,851 --> 01:07:43,018
I'm so sorry.

1044
01:07:43,602 --> 01:07:45,688
Here's your duck.

1045
01:07:51,318 --> 01:07:54,613
Normally,
I won't come to a restaurant like this.

1046
01:07:59,076 --> 01:08:00,661
- Oh!
- Ow!

1047
01:08:01,162 --> 01:08:03,164
Disgusting!

1048
01:08:12,173 --> 01:08:13,007
What?

1049
01:08:31,066 --> 01:08:32,234
Ahh!

1050
01:08:33,152 --> 01:08:35,196
That hurt.

1051
01:08:38,199 --> 01:08:39,325
It's Peng!

1052
01:08:39,992 --> 01:08:45,581
Shh. Come on, let's go. Go on!
Quick! Now! Here. Come on.

1053
01:08:49,668 --> 01:08:51,712
Quick! Find a place to hide!

1054
01:09:05,768 --> 01:09:08,562
Hmm?

1055
01:09:35,422 --> 01:09:36,340
Come on, hurry!

1056
01:09:36,966 --> 01:09:39,426
Zhao, what's going on?

1057
01:09:43,848 --> 01:09:48,060
Sir, your goose,
medium rare. Hope you enjoy it!

1058
01:09:48,143 --> 01:09:49,687
With the medium rare feathers?

1059
01:09:49,770 --> 01:09:51,438
What?
A cooked duck that runs away?

1060
01:09:53,065 --> 01:09:55,109
Hurry! Just go! Go!

1061
01:09:56,861 --> 01:09:58,821
- Get off! Get off!
- Get out of here!

1062
01:09:58,904 --> 01:10:00,489
I'll catch up! Go on!

1063
01:10:07,329 --> 01:10:08,289
Ow!

1064
01:10:11,375 --> 01:10:12,209
Peng!

1065
01:10:12,293 --> 01:10:15,004
Chi! Go! Go as fast as you can!

1066
01:10:16,046 --> 01:10:17,756
Damn goose!

1067
01:10:18,424 --> 01:10:20,509
Whoa! Oh, poop.

1068
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:22,720
Wait! Will you help us?

1069
01:10:23,095 --> 01:10:24,013
This way!

1070
01:10:27,057 --> 01:10:28,517
Come on. Hurry, hurry!

1071
01:10:31,979 --> 01:10:34,481
- My restaurant! You!
- Oh, no!

1072
01:10:34,565 --> 01:10:37,526
My restaurant! I'll kill you, I kill you!

1073
01:10:38,027 --> 01:10:38,903
No!

1074
01:10:40,905 --> 01:10:43,949
Guys! Chao! Chi! Where'd you go?

1075
01:10:44,033 --> 01:10:45,451
- We're here!
- Peng!

1076
01:10:46,410 --> 01:10:47,244
Whoa!

1077
01:10:48,287 --> 01:10:49,997
Oh, no!

1078
01:10:52,458 --> 01:10:55,210
Hey! Chi! Guys, over here!

1079
01:10:56,045 --> 01:11:00,215
Slow down! Wait! Don't go that way!

1080
01:11:02,885 --> 01:11:04,303
Whoa!

1081
01:11:04,386 --> 01:11:06,055
Come on, over here.

1082
01:11:06,138 --> 01:11:07,640
Hey! You guys.

1083
01:11:08,641 --> 01:11:10,893
No, no, no! Don't. Don't!

1084
01:11:10,976 --> 01:11:12,770
Chi! Chao!

1085
01:11:15,147 --> 01:11:15,981
Kids!

1086
01:11:17,066 --> 01:11:19,068
Get off of us!

1087
01:11:21,195 --> 01:11:22,279
Let me go.

1088
01:11:25,282 --> 01:11:26,867
Lost something, goose?

1089
01:11:26,951 --> 01:11:29,662
You know, I've really enjoyed the hunt.

1090
01:11:29,745 --> 01:11:31,580
But I much prefer the torture,

1091
01:11:31,664 --> 01:11:35,084
the dismemberment,
and the gamey aftertaste.

1092
01:11:35,668 --> 01:11:36,627
Ew!

1093
01:11:40,339 --> 01:11:42,091
Kids, go! Run!

1094
01:11:48,305 --> 01:11:50,224
Ow!

1095
01:11:52,977 --> 01:11:57,106
Quickly! Come on, run! Come on.
Quickly. Let's go.

1096
01:12:00,275 --> 01:12:03,320
No! Ah! Ow!

1097
01:12:15,374 --> 01:12:16,834
Kill him.

1098
01:12:16,917 --> 01:12:18,711
No! Leave him alone!

1099
01:12:18,794 --> 01:12:20,295
Let him go!

1100
01:12:20,379 --> 01:12:22,256
Kids forget about me! Just go! Now!

1101
01:12:22,339 --> 01:12:28,262
Don't worry. I'll look after the family,
once you've gone. Say goodbye, Daddy.

1102
01:12:28,345 --> 01:12:29,555
Peng!

1103
01:12:31,682 --> 01:12:34,727
Call me Mommy.

1104
01:12:38,147 --> 01:12:40,858
You're coming with me!

1105
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:42,234
No!

1106
01:12:46,321 --> 01:12:47,698
- No, Peng!
- Peng!

1107
01:12:47,781 --> 01:12:49,992
Come back. No!

1108
01:13:01,170 --> 01:13:03,338
No! Leave him alone!

1109
01:13:27,362 --> 01:13:33,619
This is crazy. What-- Just--
Why can't you leave us alone?

1110
01:13:34,286 --> 01:13:36,121
Birds are so arrogant.

1111
01:13:37,706 --> 01:13:42,961
Always flying away
at the first sign of danger.

1112
01:13:43,045 --> 01:13:47,966
But nobody's flying anywhere tonight.

1113
01:13:48,050 --> 01:13:51,845
You're going to go out with a whimper.

1114
01:13:51,929 --> 01:13:54,890
No. You're going out with a bang.

1115
01:13:55,891 --> 01:13:57,142
No. No, no, no...

1116
01:13:59,019 --> 01:13:59,853
No!

1117
01:14:06,568 --> 01:14:08,070
Are you okay, Mom?

1118
01:14:08,737 --> 01:14:11,865
I thought I'd lost you. Come here.
Come here. Oh, my...

1119
01:14:15,702 --> 01:14:16,995
I thought I'd lost you.

1120
01:14:27,965 --> 01:14:33,887
Oh, great guys, it's, uh... the snow.

1121
01:14:33,971 --> 01:14:35,681
We got to go.

1122
01:14:36,140 --> 01:14:37,766
Where? Where are we going?

1123
01:14:37,850 --> 01:14:40,477
Home. You're coming home with me.

1124
01:14:55,450 --> 01:14:57,578
Keep up, guys. We're doing it.

1125
01:14:58,328 --> 01:14:59,872
We'll just keep going, right?

1126
01:15:06,545 --> 01:15:10,382
Just follow my path. We can do this.

1127
01:15:18,098 --> 01:15:20,058
Oh. Peng!

1128
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:29,151
Up you go. There.
Okay, hold on tight.

1129
01:15:51,757 --> 01:15:52,799
Whoa!

1130
01:16:08,690 --> 01:16:10,817
- Are you okay?
- Yeah

1131
01:16:11,735 --> 01:16:16,240
Wow, look! Chi, what is that?

1132
01:16:16,323 --> 01:16:17,908
The haven!

1133
01:16:19,409 --> 01:16:20,744
Why is it so misty?

1134
01:16:20,827 --> 01:16:23,956
Well, that's because
they're hot pools, right, Peng?

1135
01:16:26,250 --> 01:16:27,084
Peng?

1136
01:16:28,794 --> 01:16:29,628
Peng!

1137
01:16:30,170 --> 01:16:32,214
Peng, no!

1138
01:16:34,466 --> 01:16:36,468
No!

1139
01:16:51,566 --> 01:16:57,781
Listen, kids.
You're gonna have to go on without me.

1140
01:16:57,864 --> 01:16:59,366
No! No.

1141
01:16:59,449 --> 01:17:04,705
But you're
not coming with us?

1142
01:17:05,622 --> 01:17:07,332
Not this time, buddy.

1143
01:17:07,874 --> 01:17:11,795
But you have to, otherwise,
what was all of this about?

1144
01:17:12,671 --> 01:17:14,423
No!

1145
01:17:14,506 --> 01:17:21,388
It was about getting you to a family
and that's just right over the ridge.

1146
01:17:21,471 --> 01:17:25,225
No! No! Don't you get it, okay?
You're our family.

1147
01:17:25,309 --> 01:17:27,936
Yes! Yes, I am.

1148
01:17:28,603 --> 01:17:33,066
And now I'm telling you,
you gotta get to safety, okay?

1149
01:17:33,150 --> 01:17:35,444
Because that's what mommies do.

1150
01:17:39,281 --> 01:17:44,911
You can do it, guys.
It's just a hop, skip, and a jump.

1151
01:17:47,164 --> 01:17:52,336
Yeah, well, we're sticking together.
Because that's what families do.

1152
01:18:02,054 --> 01:18:05,265
Faster, little brother!
You got to push, okay? Push! Push!

1153
01:18:06,350 --> 01:18:09,311
What? But-- Oh, no!

1154
01:18:13,857 --> 01:18:15,067
Whoa!

1155
01:18:39,633 --> 01:18:46,056
I can't do it, Chi. He's so heavy.
And my wings hurt and--

1156
01:18:46,139 --> 01:18:48,850
Chao, honk!
Peng told us to honk if we need help!

1157
01:18:49,351 --> 01:18:51,728
You can do it, Chao! Use your honk!

1158
01:18:51,812 --> 01:18:56,608
Honk like crazy! You got to honk louder!
You can do it!

1159
01:18:59,861 --> 01:19:01,571
It's not working!

1160
01:19:03,198 --> 01:19:06,201
Watch out!

1161
01:19:10,997 --> 01:19:13,083
Stabilizing. We have contact.

1162
01:19:13,458 --> 01:19:14,751
Jinjing.

1163
01:19:14,835 --> 01:19:16,628
Am I holding you up?

1164
01:19:16,711 --> 01:19:18,505
- Yeah!
- Yes! Yes! Whoo!

1165
01:19:18,588 --> 01:19:20,632
Hey, you two. Great job, you guys.

1166
01:19:26,888 --> 01:19:28,849
Oh, I say, Frazier! Duck!

1167
01:19:28,932 --> 01:19:30,058
Two ducks!

1168
01:19:30,684 --> 01:19:31,518
Ahh!

1169
01:19:32,352 --> 01:19:33,812
Again! Duck!

1170
01:19:35,063 --> 01:19:36,857
Gooses actually!

1171
01:19:36,940 --> 01:19:40,610
Yeah, you missed us! You missed us!

1172
01:19:40,694 --> 01:19:43,196
Whoa! Look out below!

1173
01:19:48,201 --> 01:19:49,619
Oh, no!

1174
01:19:57,419 --> 01:19:58,253
Oh!

1175
01:20:04,217 --> 01:20:07,429
Ow. It hurts. It hurts. Ow!

1176
01:20:07,512 --> 01:20:09,723
Ooh, sorry. Okay.

1177
01:20:09,806 --> 01:20:11,183
Um, let's see.

1178
01:20:11,266 --> 01:20:16,438
Oh, no! Okay, look where doesn't
it hurt? Maybe here?

1179
01:20:17,355 --> 01:20:18,690
Still hurts, but--

1180
01:20:18,773 --> 01:20:19,941
How about here?

1181
01:20:20,942 --> 01:20:22,486
It's good. You know, continue.

1182
01:20:22,569 --> 01:20:24,321
And what about here?

1183
01:20:25,030 --> 01:20:27,532
Oh, hi, Dad. Sir.

1184
01:20:28,241 --> 01:20:30,410
So, uh, you made it back, eh?

1185
01:20:31,077 --> 01:20:32,537
Didn't fly into a cliff or anything.

1186
01:20:35,999 --> 01:20:37,501
I got to be honest, I'm surprised.

1187
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:40,754
- Good to have you back!
- Ouch!

1188
01:20:40,837 --> 01:20:44,299
Birds of a feather migrate together.
Right, Daddy?

1189
01:20:44,382 --> 01:20:46,593
Ow! Ah.

1190
01:20:46,676 --> 01:20:50,972
Ooh. Look at the time. I got to go
prepare for, um, spring migration.

1191
01:20:51,056 --> 01:20:53,433
I'll see you, folks.
Birds of a feather migrate together!

1192
01:20:53,517 --> 01:20:55,310
Birds of a feather migrate together!

1193
01:20:55,393 --> 01:20:59,397
Jinjing, I don't want to fly solo anymore.

1194
01:20:59,481 --> 01:21:03,610
I'm sorry for, you know, everything and--

1195
01:21:03,693 --> 01:21:05,779
Oh, shush. Come here.

1196
01:21:06,029 --> 01:21:09,783
Ow, that hurts. I mean,
you know what, it doesn't even hurt.

1197
01:21:09,866 --> 01:21:12,160
Ooh, Mom, are you gonna...

1198
01:21:13,912 --> 01:21:16,540
Kids. What are you gonna do?

1199
01:21:16,915 --> 01:21:18,166
What happened to you out there?

1200
01:21:18,250 --> 01:21:20,001
Uh...

1201
01:21:20,085 --> 01:21:23,713
Jinjing, these are my kids.
Chip and Chomp.

1202
01:21:23,797 --> 01:21:25,090
Chope and Chang.

1203
01:21:25,173 --> 01:21:26,758
Chip and Choop. Chope and Chop.

1204
01:21:26,841 --> 01:21:28,885
Chomp and Choo Choo.

1205
01:21:28,969 --> 01:21:30,345
- Choop and Change.
- Chope and Chang.

1206
01:21:35,850 --> 01:21:38,019
It's actually Chi and Chao.

1207
01:21:38,103 --> 01:21:42,399
And I want them to be part of our flock.
What do you say?

1208
01:21:42,941 --> 01:21:45,151
How about part of our family?

1209
01:21:45,235 --> 01:21:48,321
Yes! Whoop, whoop.

1210
01:21:48,405 --> 01:21:50,240
This is so cool!

1211
01:21:59,749 --> 01:22:03,545
Wait! You think two's gonna be enough?

1212
01:22:04,045 --> 01:22:09,009
What-- Two. Two actually--
I mean, I think it's more than--

1213
01:22:09,092 --> 01:22:12,012
You know, I, uh-- Two?
We should wait for spring, right?

1214
01:22:12,095 --> 01:22:13,972
I mean, that's, you know,
what everyone does.

1215
01:22:14,055 --> 01:22:16,391
Not that I care what other people do,
you know what I mean?

1216
01:22:16,474 --> 01:22:19,769
I just want you to be happy,
but you know, it's like if we had two--

1217
01:22:19,853 --> 01:22:21,104
We don't even have a nest, right?

1218
01:22:21,187 --> 01:22:25,066
I mean, you know, two plus--
Can I just take a nap?

1219
01:24:37,615 --> 01:24:39,075
I made it.

1220
01:24:40,827 --> 01:24:43,246
Peng? Hello, Peng?

1221
01:24:44,831 --> 01:24:46,708
Where did everyone go?
