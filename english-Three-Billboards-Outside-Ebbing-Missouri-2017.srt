00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,620
You Red Welby?

3
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,890
Yes, ma'am.
How may I help you?

4
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,990
Are you in charge
of renting

5
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,600
the three billboards out
on Drinkwater Road?

6
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,700
I didn't know we had
any billboards on...

7
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,000
Where is Drinkwater Road?

8
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,700
Past Sizemore turn-off.

9
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,740
Nobody uses it since the
freeway got put in.

10
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,880
You're right.

11
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,080
We got three billboards
out there.

12
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:13,180
Nobody's put nothing
up there since 1986.

13
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,380
That was Huggies.

14
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,920
How much to rent all three
of them out for the year?

15
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,160
A year?

16
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,720
On a road
that no one goes down

17
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:22,960
unless they got lost
or they're retards...

18
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,990
For a year?

19
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,330
Quick, ain't you, Welby?

20
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,370
Well,

21
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,530
since what I say
goes these days

22
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,370
down at the Ebbing
Advertising Desk...

23
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,840
I'm gonna strike you
a real good deal.

24
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,410
What's your name?

25
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:41,010
What's the law on what you can
and cannot say on a billboard?

26
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:43,410
Nothing defamatory,

27
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,350
and you can't say "fuck",
"piss" or "cunt". That right?

28
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,350
Uh...

29
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,960
Or...

30
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,720
Anus.

31
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,430
Well, I think
I'll be all right then.

32
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,030
Here's 5,000
for the first month.

33
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,330
I assume that'll cover it.

34
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,630
And here's what
they are to say.

35
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,870
Why don't you
write up a contract

36
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,300
betwixt us
while you're at it.

37
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,550
Make sure nobody rents them
billboards out from under me.

38
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,210
I guess you're
Angela Hayes's mother.

39
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:18,380
That's right.
I'm Angela Hayes's mother.

40
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,220
Name's Mildred.

41
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:30,230
How long before
you get them put up?

42
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,500
Shall we say by...

43
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,000
Easter Sunday?

44
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,400
That would be perfect.

45

00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,580

- Yeah.

00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:29,650
Huh?

63
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,370
Advertising, I guess.

64
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:20,510
Advertising what?

65
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,250
Something obscure?

66
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,880
I'll say. Yeah.

67
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,650
Don't I know your face
from some place?

68
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,150
I don't know, do you?

69
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,520
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

70
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,930
I could arrest you
right now...

71
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,060
For what?

72
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,260
For emptying your bucket.

73
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:50,930
That's being bad against
the environment laws.

74
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:55,570
Well, before you do that,
Officer Dixon,

75
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:56,940
how about
you have a look

76
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,940
at that first billboard
over there?

77
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,880
And then we can have
ourself a conversation

78
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,550
about the motherfucking
environment.

79
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,380
How about that?

80
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,600
Fuck me.

81
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,180
Don't, William.

82
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:36,150
Dixon, you goddamn asshole.

83
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:39,180
I'm in the middle
of my goddamn Easter dinner.

84
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,120
Sorry, kids.

85
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,520
I know, Chief,

86
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,090
and I'm sorry for calling
you at home and all, but...

87
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,760
I think we got kind of a problem.

88
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,770
No, no. Go back.

89
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,470
Sorry I'm late, Denise.

90
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,940
Did you put up
those billboards yet?

91
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:39,970
They're up.

92
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:44,270
Go, girl. You go
fuck those cops up.

93
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,940
What the fuck do you think
you're doing, Welby?

94
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:49,680
You didn't think there would
be legal ramifications?

95
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,350
What's the legal
ramifications, Cedric?

96
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,520
Do you want
me to explain?

97
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,820
Little punk like you.
And don't call me Cedric!

98
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:59,690
Ain't contravening no laws
on any fucking thing.

99
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:00,560
I checked.

100
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,590
And where did you check
all this out?

101
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:03,860
In a...

102
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,990
A book.

103
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,330
Which book, genius?

104
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,900
Book called <i>Suck My Ass,
It's None Of Your Business.</i>

105
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,340
Fuck.

106
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:18,140
How long has this person,
or persons,

107
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,140
rented these
billboards out for?

108
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,680
Oh, the year.

109
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,820
How long has she
actually paid for?

110
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,150
The year.

111
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:30,420
So it's a "she", is it?

112
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,920
I ain't at liberty
to divulge

113
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,730
that kind of information,
Chief.

114
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,200
Mildred Hayes, perhaps?

115
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,170
Ain't at liberty
to divulge

116
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,870
that kind of information,
Chief.

117
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,770
Do you really wanna fuck

118
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:47,000
with the Ebbing
Police Department, Red?

119
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,310
Do you?

120
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,210
I guess.

121
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,310
He said what?
To your face?

122
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,710
No crime has been
committed here.

123
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:57,050
Defamation of character
ain't a crime?

124
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,880
Not if she's simply
asking a question.

125
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,920
What are you, an idiot?

126
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,450
Don't call me
an idiot, Dixon!

127
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:03,690
I didn't
call you an idiot,

128
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,490
I asked if you was an idiot.
That was a question.

129
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:06,890
He got you there, Cedric.

130
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,260
That's it.

131
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,060
Don't fly off the handle.

132
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,460
Why in the hell
you keep that man on?

133
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,660
He's a good man at heart.

134
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,830
He tortured a guy
in custody, Bill.

135
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:18,400
There was no real evidence
to support that.

136
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,740
Take them down.

137
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,870
Take that shit down.

138
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,940
What shit?

139
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,940
Hey, boy. Think I wouldn't
take you out right here

140
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:28,950
on Main Street, Red?

141
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,880
Thought you only took out
black dudes, Dixon.

142
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,220
No! No! Stop it.

143
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,950
You ever fucking touch me,
motherfucker...

144
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,790
You drunk?

145
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,960
- Are you drunk right now?
- Get up.

146
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,330
Nobody ever goes
down that road anyways.

147
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:51,130
Unless they got lost.
Or they're retards.

148
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,870
Don't be nervous,
is the main thing.

149
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,500
It will go just fine.

150
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,170
Don't look into the
camera, obviously.

151
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,640
Let's hold
for this car.

152
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,210
In three, two, one.

153
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:04,850
So, Mildred Hayes, why did
you put up these billboards?

154
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,650
<i>My daughter, Angela,</i>

155
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:08,450
<i>was abducted,
raped and murdered</i>

156
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:09,550
<i>seven months ago</i>

157
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,250
<i>along this selfsame
stretch of road.</i>

158
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,520
What you watching,
Momma? Stupid news?

159
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,430
<i>Seems to me
the local police department</i>

160
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,590
<i>is too busy
torturing black folks</i>

161
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,060
<i>to be bothered doing anything
about solving actual crime.</i>

162
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,270
<i>I thought these billboards</i>

163
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:24,800
<i>might concentrate
their minds some.</i>

164
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,400
Fuck.

165
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,400
<i>I don't know
what the police are doing.</i>

166
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,740
<i>I do know that my...</i>

167
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:33,410
...daughter's burnt body
is lying six feet underground.

168
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,280
They're eating
Krispy Kremes

169
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,410
<i>and busting eight-year-olds</i>

170
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,310
<i>for skating
around parking lots.</i>

171
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,950
<i>And Chief Willoughby,</i>

172
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,180
<i>why single him out?</i>

173
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,550
<i>He's the head of them.</i>

174
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,250
<i>Buck's gotta stop somewhere.</i>

175
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,450
<i>And the buck
stops at Willoughby?</i>

176
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,820
<i>Yeah.
Dead right it does.</i>

177
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,040
You all right
there, fella?

178
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:10,080
Looks like we got a war
on our hands.

179
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,940
Can we talk?

180
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:43,010
I'd do anything
to catch the guy

181
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:44,150
who did it,
Mrs. Hayes.

182
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,650
But when the DNA
don't match

183
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,580
no one who's ever
been arrested,

184
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:51,390
and when the DNA don't match
any other crime nationwide,

185
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,890
and when there wasn't
a single eyewitness

186
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,560
from the time
she'd left your house

187
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,030
to the time we found her,

188
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,130
right now there ain't
too much more we can do.

189
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:04,370
Could pull blood from every
man and boy in this town

190
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,170
over the age of eight.

191
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:10,570
There's civil rights laws
prevents that, Mrs. Hayes.

192
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,540
What if he was just
passing through town?

193
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,380
Every man
in the country, then.

194
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,650
What if he was just passing
through the country?

195
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:19,610
If it was me,
I'd start up a database.

196
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,380
Every male baby what's
born, stick them on it,

197
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,590
and as soon as he done
something wrong,

198
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,750
cross-reference it,

199
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,530
make 100% certain
it was a correct match,

200
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:29,860
then kill him.

201
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,500
Yeah, well, there's
definitely civil rights laws

202
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,800
prevents that.

203
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:44,110
I'm doing everything I can
to track him down.

204
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,480
I don't think those
billboards is very fair.

205
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,480
The time it took you
to get out here

206
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,710
whining like a bitch,
Willoughby,

207
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,110
some other poor girl's
probably

208
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,110
being butchered
right now.

209
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,480
But I'm glad you got
your priorities straight,

210
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:55,990
I'll say that for you.

211
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,700
There's something else,
Mildred.

212
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,670
I got cancer.

213
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,440
I'm dying.

214
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,740
I know it.

215
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,580
Huh?

216
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,150
I know it. Most everybody
in town knows it.

217
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,650
And you still put up
those billboards?

218
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,190
Well, they wouldn't be
as effective

219
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,190
after you croak.
Right?

220
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:17,330
Well, looky looky.

221
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:18,600
If it ain't
the instigator

222
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,800
of this whole goddamn affair
in the first place.

223
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:22,940
I didn't
instigate shit, Dixon.

224
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,440
Playing pool
against the town midget.

225
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,610
He's right, Red,

226
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:28,640
you are playing pool
against the town midget.

227
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,780
He's a cop,
he's observant.

228
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,820
I always disliked you,

229
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,120
ever since you was
a snotty little child.

230
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,920
You still look like
a snotty little child.

231
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,760
That's unfortunate. I always
thought you was great.

232
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:46,260
Even your name, Red Welby.
Even your name I disliked.

233
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,800
Well, okay.

234
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,700
Like you was some kind of
goddamn communist

235
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,870
and proud of it.

236
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:57,840
No, it's because
I got red hair.

237
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,240
You know what they do
to faggots

238
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,580
down in Cuba, Welby?

239
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:02,380
Wow, that's left field.

240
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:05,350
No, what do they do to
faggots down in Cuba, Dixon?

241
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,320
They kill them.

242
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,320
Which, it might surprise you
to learn, I'm against.

243
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,720
I'm not sure if they do
kill faggots

244
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,020
down in Cuba, Dixon.

245
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:16,320
I know Cuba's human rights
record's pretty deplorable

246
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:18,590
when it comes to
homosexuality,

247
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,900
but killing them?

248
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,730
Are you sure you ain't
thinking of Wyoming?

249
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:26,900
Always gotta be
the smart-ass, Jesus.

250
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,610
He's quite good,
isn't he?

251
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:36,140
Hey, Willoughby's a good man.
Hey, look at me. Look at me.

252
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,310
I'm talking nice
to you now, aren't I?

253
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,820
I'm talking nice to you.

254
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,020
He's a good man.

255
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,690
Shouldn't have this be the
only thing he thinks about,

256
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,320
last months left to him.

257
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,230
Last months what?

258
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:55,200
Oh...

259
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,270
You didn't know?

260
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,100
Yeah, pancreatic.

261
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,570
I'm up next. You old
ladies quit yakking.

262
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:03,670
Rude.

263
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:04,910
Hey, Mildred.

264
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,540
I saw you on TV
the other day.

265
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,980
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, you looked good.

266
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:13,180
I mean, you know,
you came across really good

267
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,080
in the things
that you were saying.

268
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:17,250
I didn't think you
came across real good.

269
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,790
I thought you came across
as a stupid-ass.

270
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:21,890
Ain't it about time
you got home

271
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:23,730
to your momma, Dixon?

272
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,930
No, it ain't time
I go home to my momma.

273
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:31,100
I told her I was gonna be out
till 12:00, actually.

274
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,170
Jesus.

275
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:41,580
That's me versus you,
Mildred. Uh-huh.

276
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,580
Hey, Robbie.
I think that midget

277
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,750
wants to get in my pants.

278
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,050
Father Montgomery.

279
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:52,190
Mildred. I'm sorry to be
calling on you so late,

280
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,420
but, uh...

281
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:57,430
I must say, Robbie has
been the consummate host.

282
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:01,200
Despite his having had,
as he was just telling me

283
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,230
somewhat of a tricky day
at school.

284
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:06,270
Just some of the guys
on the team giving me crap.

285
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,570
Crap about what?

286
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:10,210
About the billboards,
Mildred.

287
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,670
Which is what I've come to
have a word with you about.

288
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,040
Oh. Proceed.

289
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:17,910
I know how hard it's
been for you, Mildred,

290
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:19,820
this past year.
We all do.

291
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,990
And if there is ever
anything that you need,

292
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,620
we will be there for you.

293
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,960
Always.

294
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,260
But the town also knows

295
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,300
what kind of a man
William Willoughby is.

296
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,730
And the town is dead set

297
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:36,730
against these billboards
of yours.

298
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:37,970
Took a poll,
did you, Father?

299
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:41,240
If you hadn't stopped
coming to church,

300
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,510
you'd have a little bit
more understanding

301
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,440
of the depth
of people's feelings.

302
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,350
More than a dozen people
came to me on Sunday.

303
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,450
So, yes, I took a poll.

304
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:57,190
Everybody is with you
about Angela.

305
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,190
Nobody is with you
about this.

306
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:08,730
You know what I was
thinking about today?

307
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,470
I was thinking
about those street gangs

308
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,870
they have
down in Los Angeles,

309
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,800
those Crips
and those Bloods.

310
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:16,510
And I was thinking about
that bunch of new laws

311
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:17,670
they came up with

312
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,640
in the 1980s,
I think it was,

313
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:24,110
to combat those street gangs,
those Crips and those Bloods.

314
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,410
And, if I remember rightly,

315
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:28,550
the gist of what those
new laws were saying was,

316
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,190
if you join
one of these gangs,

317
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,890
and you're running
with them,

318
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:35,260
and down the block one night,
unbeknownst to you,

319
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,790
one of your fellow Crips,
or your fellow Bloods,

320
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,600
shoot up a place,
or stab a guy...

321
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,660
Well then, even though

322
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,270
you may not know
nothing about it

323
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:47,870
and you were just standing
on a street corner

324
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:49,870
minding your own business,

325
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:54,480
what these new laws said
was you're still culpable.

326
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,840
You're still culpable
by the very act of having

327
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,280
joined those Crips
and those Bloods

328
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,280
in the first place.

329
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,620
Which got me thinking,
Father,

330
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,150
that whole
type of situation

331
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:07,490
is kinda like you
church boys, ain't it?

332
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:10,960
You got your colors,
you got your clubhouse.

333
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,460
You're, for want
of a better word, a gang.

334
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,930
And if you were upstairs

335
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:17,930
smoking a pipe
and reading your Bible

336
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,830
while one of your fellow
gang members

337
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,740
is downstairs fucking
an altar boy, well...

338
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:26,240
Father, just like those Crips,
and just like those Bloods,

339
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,710
you're culpable.

340
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:30,780
Because you joined
the gang, man.

341
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,350
I don't care
if you never did shit,

342
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:35,020
you never saw shit,
you never heard shit,

343
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:39,220
you join the gang,
you're culpable.

344
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:42,420
And when a person is culpable
to altar-boy-fucking,

345
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:43,590
or any kinda boy-fucking,

346
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:47,600
because I know you guys didn't
really narrow that down,

347
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,030
then you kinda forfeit the
right to come into my house

348
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,900
and say anything about me

349
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,310
or my life, or my daughter,
or my billboards.

350
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,210
So why don't you just finish
up your tea there, Father,

351
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:03,280
and get the fuck
outta my kitchen.

352
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:16,290
But thanks for coming up
anyway, Father.

353
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,500
How you been
feeling, Bill?

354
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:28,040
Ah, like I got cancer
in a major organ.

355
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,170
Well, I just want you to know
we're all on your side

356
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:33,280
about this
Mildred Hayes thing.

357
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,220
If I have to hear that
one more fucking time...

358
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:43,220
I'm done with this shit.
I can't waste my life waiting.

359
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,390
Stop reading
fucking comic books

360
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:49,920
and get me the file
on the Hayes case.

361
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:52,760
Angela Hayes case
or the Mildred Hayes case?

362
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,900
There is no
Mildred Hayes case.

363
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,430
We've had
two official complaints

364
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:58,370
about those billboards,
so, actually...

365
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,370
From who?

366
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,610
There's a lady
with a funny eye

367
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,110
and a fat dentist.

368
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:13,180
Get me the file
on the Angela Hayes case.

369
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:16,750
"Lady with
a funny fucking eye"?

370
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,160
Jesus Christ.

371
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:32,700
Late night?

372
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,170
No.

373
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:39,210
Lay off that Welby guy,
will you?

374
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,380
Or you'll do what?

375
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,650
Kick your momma's
fucking teeth in.

376
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,020
No, you won't.

377
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:51,150
Who told you I was laying on him anyway?
The midget?

378
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:53,960
What the fuck
are you talking about?

379
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,920
And I'm trying
to fucking concentrate.

380
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,290
Fucking midgets!

381
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:23,690
What you looking for
anyway?

382
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:28,260
There's nothing
to look for.

383
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,530
I don't know what it is.

384
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:35,600
It feels like
it's kinda waggling.

385
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,700
Well, if it's waggling,
it's gonna have to come out.

386
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:44,040
Ain't you gonna
take a look at it first?

387
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,310
It's gonna have to come out.

388
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,520
Can I get a little
Novocaine there, doc?

389
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:12,470
Give it a couple
of minutes.

390
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,190
There's a lot
of good friends

391
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,890
of Bill Willoughby
in this town.

392
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,960
No! Ow! Stop! No!

393
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,300
God damn it!

394
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,740
Then why don't you tell
those good friends

395
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,800
of Bill Willoughby

396
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:50,610
to tell him to go do his
fucking job, fat boy.

397
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,120
Hey, Mildred.

398
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,820
You didn't happen
to pay a visit

399
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,190
to the dentist today,
did you?

400
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:11,930
- No.
- Huh?

401
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,330
I said "no".

402
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:16,730
So it wasn't you
who drilled a little hole

403
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:21,100
in one of big fat Geoffrey's
big fat thumbnails, no?

404
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,070
- Of course not.
- Huh?

405
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,970
I said "of course not".

406
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:27,110
You drilled a hole
in the dentist?

407
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,410
Denise, no, I didn't.

408
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:30,340
I thought it was
kinda funny myself,

409
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:32,880
but he wants
to press charges,

410
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,890
so we're gonna have to
bring you in, I'm afraid.

411
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,270
So how's it all going

412
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,440
in the nigger-torturing
business, Dixon?

413
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:04,210
It's persons-of-color-torturing
business, these days.

414
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:07,590
If you wanna know,
I didn't torture nobody.

415
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,420
What's the matter
with you,

416
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:13,220
saying that
goddamn stuff on TV?

417
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,160
My momma watches
that station.

418
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,690
She doesn't know
about the torturing?

419
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:19,360
No. She's against
that kinda thing.

420
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,560
Who's against what?

421
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,360
My momma is against
persons-of-color-torturing.

422
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:24,830
She said
"nigger-torturing".

423
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,870
I said, "You can't say
'nigger-torturing' no more.

424
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:29,440
"You gotta say
persons-of-color-torturing."

425
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,780
Isn't that right, Chief?

426
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,680
Ain't that right?

427
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:39,210
I think I'll be able to
take care of Mrs. Hayes

428
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,650
on my own
from here on, Jason.

429
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,860
Sure, Chief.
I'll be right outside.

430
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:02,870
Don't give me that look.

431
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:06,870
If you got rid of every cop
with vaguely racist leanings,

432
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,940
you'd have three cops left,

433
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:11,350
and all of them are gonna
hate the fags.

434
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,820
So what are you gonna do,
you know?

435
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,120
I wanna know something,
Mildred.

436
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,690
Why did you drill a hole

437
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:22,760
through poor fat
Geoffrey's thumbnail?

438
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,760
That did not happen.

439
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,230
His hand slipped.

440
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:28,830
He drilled a hole
through his own self.

441
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,230
Did he say I did it?

442
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:32,030
I guess it's his word

443
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,040
against mine, then, huh?

444
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,840
Kinda like in all those
rape cases you hear about.

445
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,810
Except, this time,
the chick ain't losing.

446
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:42,040
It ain't really about winning
or losing, though,

447
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:44,180
is it, Mildred?

448
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:47,280
You think I care about
who wins or loses

449
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,020
between the two of youse?

450
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,290
You think
I care about dentists?

451
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,260
I don't care about
dentists.

452
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,460
Nobody cares
about dentists.

453
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:59,500
What I do care about,
or what I'm

454
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,700
interested in

455
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,800
is tying you up
in court so long

456
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,070
that your hours
at the gift shop

457
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:10,410
be so shot to shit

458
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:12,310
that you ain't gonna
have a penny

459
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,850
to pay for another
month's billboards.

460
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,210
That's what
I'm interested in.

461
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:19,850
I got some dough
put away.

462
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:22,150
But what I heard was
you had to sell off

463
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:23,580
your ex-husband's
tractor-trailer

464
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:27,060
to even pay for this month's
billboards, that right?

465
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:30,760
How is old Charlie,
by the way?

466
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:34,090
He still shacked up with
that pretty little intern

467
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,300
works down at the zoo?

468
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,030
Still shacked up with some
chick smells of shit.

469
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,200
I don't know if the zoo's
got anything to do with it.

470
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,070
Although I'd hope so.

471
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:47,240
How old is she?
Nineteen?

472
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,480
That must smart.

473
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,850
Keep trying.
Keep trying.

474
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:56,050
What's Charlie think about
these billboards of yours,

475
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:57,920
an ex-cop like Charlie?

476
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,190
Ex-cop, ex-wife-beater.

477
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,490
Same difference,
I guess, right?

478
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:03,460
His word against yours,
though, right?

479
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,600
Charlie don't know
about them, does he?

480
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,200
It's none of his business.

481
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,930
He's kinda paying
for them, though.

482
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:12,270
I'm paying for them!

483
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,400
This month you are.

484
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,670
How about when...

485
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,080
I didn't mean to...

486
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,210
I know.

487
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:24,340
It was an accident.

488
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,620
I know, baby.

489
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:27,680
It's blood.

490
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:33,090
I'm gonna go
get somebody.

491
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:34,990
Hey!

492
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:37,290
Just let her go.

493
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:38,530
Come on, Chief.

494
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:40,560
Just let her go!

495
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,440
Easy, easy, easy.

496
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:51,610
Hey...

497
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:14,430
Do birds get cancer?

498
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:16,000
Huh?

499
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,100
Birds. Do they get cancer?

500
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,470
I don't know. Dogs do.

501
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:23,610
Yeah, well, I wasn't talking
about dogs, was I?

502
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:33,320
Great, the good old "Raped
While Dying" ride home.

503
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,980
If there was two seconds
in a day

504
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:38,120
when I wasn't thinking
about how she died...

505
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:41,190
"Think about it some more,
why don't you?"

506
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:43,490
As much as
a person might have

507
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:46,430
tried to avoid the details
of what happened

508
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:48,300
because he didn't think
it would do any good,

509
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,270
and he couldn't
bear it,

510
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:54,000
it's also good to be informed
in 20-foot-high font

511
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,840
the precise details
of her last moments.

512
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,710
That it wasn't enough
that she was raped

513
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:03,580
and it wasn't enough
that she died, no.

514
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:06,480
"Raped While Dying."

515
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,920
Thank you, Mom.

516
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:11,920
I gave you
the police reports.

517
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,990
I didn't read them.

518
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:17,260
I'm depressed enough
as it fucking is.

519
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:59,230
<i>Mom?</i>

520
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,400
<i>Yeah?</i>

521
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,500
<i>You ain't going out
again tonight, are you?</i>

522
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:04,710
Denise and I are gonna
grab a couple of beers.

523
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,010
Denise gonna be
driving you?

524
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:08,680
Why don't you just
ask to borrow the car?

525
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:11,080
- Can I borrow the car?
- No.

526
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,050
Bitch!

527
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,820
I will give you money
for a taxi

528
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,680
if you ask nice
and don't call me a bitch.

529
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,990
Why make me ask if you
weren't gonna let me?

530
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:18,950
It was funny.

531
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,550
And because you've been
smoking pot all day.

532
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,660
- You are such a hypocrite.
- Hypocrite?

533
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,390
- Yeah.
- How?

534
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:26,430
Drove drunk
when we were kids.

535
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:28,030
What are you
talking about?

536
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,400
Daddy told me.

537
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,660
When did you see him?

538
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:32,070
Don't change the subject.

539
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:35,400
Did you drive drunk with us
in the car when we were kids?

540
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:36,600
Once, maybe.

541
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:37,970
Okay, once?

542
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:39,540
When he was in the middle
of beating the shit out of me.

543
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,210
Which we've only
got your word about!

544
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:42,740
Angela, for Christ sakes.

545
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,750
Why are you
never on my side?

546
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,480
I'm always on your side when
you're not being a cunt!

547
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,650
Hey!

548
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:49,480
There will be no more
"cunts" in this house.

549
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:50,750
Are you moving out?

550
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,020
It was a gag.

551
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,960
Are you gonna let me
borrow the car or what?

552
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,690
Why don't you
just walk, Angela?

553
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,700
You know what?
I will walk.

554
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:06,700
And you know what else?
I hope I get raped on the way!

555
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,970
I hope you do too!

556
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,990
<i>Gonna need to keep you
in a few days, Bill.</i>

557
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:28,360
<i>You shouldn't be
coughing up blood.</i>

558
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,730
Yeah, I kinda
guessed that, Doc.

559
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:33,930
I'll swing by
in the morning.

560
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:35,000
Anne.

561
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:42,400
I guess I'll go
get your coat, huh?

562
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:44,340
Well, you know
I ain't staying.

563
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,940
You know
I ain't arguing.

564
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,130
Oops.

565
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,140
You old cunt.

566
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,770
I'm not old, Robbie.

567
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,340
That's Dad.

568
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:58,480
Hey, Dad.
How's it going?

569
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,850
Where's the crazy lady?

570
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:09,420
Kid has got Rice fucking
Krispies in his fucking hair.

571
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:10,390
What's going on?

572
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:12,860
What's going on with these
fucking billboards?

573
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,560
Kinda self-explanatory.

574
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:17,230
Why don't you
explain it to me?

575
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:20,700
Guess it ain't
self-explanatory, then.

576
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:23,600
I wanted certain
people's minds

577
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:25,840
kept on certain
people's jobs, is all.

578
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,110
Hadn't heard from them
in seven goddamn months.

579
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:30,710
I've heard an awful lot
from them

580
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:32,180
since I put them
billboards up.

581
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,680
You think this has
focused their minds? Mmm?

582
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:38,150
It's focused their minds
on how exactly

583
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,420
are they gonna
fuck you up.

584
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,420
The more you keep a case
in the public eye,

585
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:44,060
the better your chances
are of getting it solved.

586
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,990
It's in
all the guidebooks.

587
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:47,990
How much
these billboards cost?

588
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,600
About the same
as a tractor-trailer.

589
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:52,070
What the fuck
are you laughing at?

590
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:52,930
Nothing.

591
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,030
Laughed at by a guy

592
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,740
with fucking cereal
in his hair.

593
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,340
How's Penelope?

594
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,740
Huh? She's all right.

595
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,170
Why don't you
invite her in?

596
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,810
Save leaving her
sitting out there.

597
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:03,950
- She here?
- She's out in the car.

598
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,480
That explains it.

599
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,010
That explains what?

600
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,350
I know
I smelt something.

601
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,660
Let her go!

602
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:16,760
Oh! Um, I kinda need
to use the bathroom,

603
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,930
but if it's inconvenient...

604
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:20,160
Actually, it is
inconvenient, isn't it?

605
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,500
I can hold it.
It's all right.

606
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,900
It's the first door
down the hall.

607
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,370
Sure? I feel like
I'm intruding.

608
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:26,670
Just go pee.

609
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:27,910
Oh.

610
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,990
Look, you said
what you came to say.

611
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:49,520
So why don't you go
get zoo girl

612
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:51,530
and get the hell out of
my house, all right?

613
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:54,660
Um, actually, zoo-wise,
they were letting people go

614
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,830
at the zoo,
unfortunately,

615
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:58,200
and it was a case of
"last in, first out". So...

616
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,800
Unfortunately the zoo
had to let me go.

617
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,940
But they were looking
for people

618
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:05,070
down at the horse rides
for the disableds.

619
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:06,870
So I'm working
down there now,

620
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,250
looking after
the disableds' horses.

621
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:19,420
Don't say a word.

622
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,160
I wasn't gonna say a word.

623
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:27,060
You don't think I don't wish
it had never happened?

624
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,870
You don't think I don't wish
she was still here?

625
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,910
I know you do.

626
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:38,040
I know you do.

627
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,410
Billboards ain't gonna
bring her back, Mildred.

628
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:46,580
Neither is fucking
19-year-olds, Charlie.

629
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:49,450
Yeah?

630
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,090
But I know that.

631
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:55,460
Just go.

632
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:58,330
Yeah, all right.

633
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,390
I'm such a shitty dad

634
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,300
and you're such a great mom.
All right.

635
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:06,470
So how come a week
before she died

636
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:09,600
she's asking if she can move
in with me at my place?

637
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:11,140
Couldn't stand you bitching

638
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:13,010
and fighting
with each other no more.

639
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:14,040
I don't believe you.

640
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:18,150
I said, "Stay,
your mom loves you."

641
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:22,280
Now I wish I hadn't.
She'd still fucking be here.

642
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,680
I don't believe you!

643
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:25,390
Don't believe me.

644
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:28,090
Ask Froot Loop boy.

645
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:39,500
Is that true?

646
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,270
I don't know, Mom.

647
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,140
Yeah, you do.

648
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:56,380
<i>What's the matter?</i>

649
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:57,650
<i>Nothing.</i>

650
00:40:57,650 --> 00:41:01,090
Oh, come on,
not Donald Sutherland again.

651
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:03,790
What is this, frickin'
Donald Sutherland season?

652
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:05,960
I like him.
I like his hair.

653
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,300
Hair?

654
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,870
This is the one
where his little girl dies.

655
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:13,970
Always a plus in a movie.

656
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:15,940
Talking of dead kids,

657
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:18,210
what's happening
with the billboard lady?

658
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:21,280
Oh, that kooz
won't listen to reason.

659
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,280
She's tough as an old boot.

660
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,480
Oh...

661
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,080
Why don't you just
fuck her over

662
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,580
through her friends then?

663
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,220
Huh?

664
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:32,820
You know, why don't you
fuck her friends over?

665
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:35,260
Bring her around
that way.

666
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:38,190
She got any friends
you can fuck over?

667
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:52,710
Rat bastards.

668
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:03,920
Hey, fuckhead!

669
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,990
What?

670
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:06,420
Don't say "what", Dixon,

671
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:08,760
when she comes in
calling you a fuckhead.

672
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,660
- And don't you...
- Shut up!

673
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:12,860
You, get over here.

674
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:16,360
No! You, get over here.

675
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,470
All right.

676
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:19,300
What? Dixon!

677
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,470
You do not allow a member
of the public

678
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:23,340
to call you a fuckhead
in the station house!

679
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,640
I'm taking care of it
in my own way.

680
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,580
Now get out of my ass.

681
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:30,910
Mrs. Hayes, have a seat.
What can I do for you today?

682
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:32,410
Where's Denise Watson?

683
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,950
In the clanger.

684
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:35,850
- On what charge?
- Possession.

685
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:37,020
Of what?

686
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:38,690
Two marijuana cigarettes.

687
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:40,020
Big ones.

688
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:41,290
When is the bail hearing?

689
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:43,790
I asked the judge
not to give her bail

690
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:46,660
on account of her previous
marijuana violations,

691
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:48,100
and the judge said "sure."

692
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,370
You fucking prick!

693
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,970
You do not call an officer
of the law a fucking prick

694
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:58,310
in his own station house,
Mrs. Hayes.

695
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:00,080
Or anywhere, actually.

696
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:03,780
What's with the new
attitude, Dixon?

697
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:05,780
Your momma
been coaching you?

698
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,590
No.

699
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,780
My momma

700
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:12,120
doesn't do that.

701
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:17,130
Take them down,
you hear me?

702
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:20,300
You did good, Dixon.

703
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,300
Yeah, I know I did.

704
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:27,870
Almost got that.

705
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:30,340
The rules here are twofold.

706
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:33,940
No kid can leave
this goddamn blanket

707
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:36,240
at any goddamn time.

708
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:38,210
And every single one

709
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:40,980
of these dolls
and these teddy bears

710
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:43,280
has got to be hooked up.

711
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:45,150
Now, your momma and I,

712
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,590
although it won't
look like it,

713
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:50,360
we'll be watching
every goddamn move you make.

714
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:53,530
So the most important thing
while we are watching you

715
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:57,930
is that you do not
leave this blanket.

716
00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:03,270
Next most important thing,
you do not at any stage

717
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:05,340
allow the fishing rods

718
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:09,080
to stick into you
or your sister's eyeballs,

719
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,810
as this would be
counter-productive

720
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:14,250
to the entire operation.

721
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:15,680
What would it be?

722
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:20,920
Counter-productive
to the entire operation.

723
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,660
Then, troops,

724
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:27,460
start fishing.

725
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,430
We are not.

726
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:33,900
We are.

727
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:37,240
Yes.

728
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:19,650
Hey, baby.

729
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:27,420
Yeah,
still no arrests.

730
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:32,860
How come, I wonder?

731
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:34,800
Because there ain't no God,
the whole world's empty,

732
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,330
and it doesn't matter
what we do to each other?

733
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:41,670
I hope not.

734
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:48,640
How come
you came up here

735
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,950
outta nowhere
looking so pretty?

736
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:53,820
You ain't trying
to make me believe

737
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:56,820
in reincarnation
or something, are you?

738
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:59,620
Because you're pretty,
but you ain't her.

739
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:03,060
She got killed,

740
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:05,260
and now she's dead forever.

741
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,630
I do thank you
for coming though.

742
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:14,100
If I had some food
I'd give it to you.

743
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:15,570
All I got is some Doritos.

744
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:18,810
They might kill you,
they're kind of pointy.

745
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:20,680
Then where would we be?

746
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:40,130
Yeah, so I, uh,
just happened to be looking

747
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:43,930
over our contract that we
drew up back that time.

748
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:45,870
What I realized was I...

749
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:49,300
I realized that although
payment is to be made

750
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:50,800
on the first day
of each month,

751
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:54,680
the first payment you paid
was actually a deposit.

752
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,710
Wasn't it?
It's like we said.

753
00:46:56,710 --> 00:46:57,910
So, actually,
in point of fact,

754
00:46:57,910 --> 00:47:00,950
you're actually behind
in your payments now,

755
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:03,320
by, yeah, a month.

756
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,890
Yeah, that's, uh...

757
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:09,520
It's what the contract says,
looking over it and all.

758
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:12,330
The lawyer says so too.

759
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:14,560
When you need
this next payment by, Red?

760
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,400
Well, now, really.

761
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:24,340
Or by... Uh...

762
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:26,310
Friday?

763
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:28,110
Wow.

764
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:29,610
When you can't
trust the lawyers

765
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:30,710
and the advertising men,

766
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:33,310
what the hell's America
coming to, huh?

767
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,220
Who got to you, Red?

768
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:36,920
Willoughby?

769
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,150
Nobody got to me.

770
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:39,820
My fat fucking ass.

771
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:43,920
He's dying, Mildred.

772
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:46,490
We're all fucking dying!

773
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,300
Hi, Pamela.
We're a little bit busy

774
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:50,130
at the moment,
if that's okay.

775
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:51,630
I know you were
real anxious

776
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:53,070
about talking to Mrs. Hayes
this morning...

777
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:54,030
Anxious? No.

778
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:57,240
No need to be, because
you won't believe it!

779
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:00,440
A little Mexican delivery boy
just dropped in with this.

780
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:01,680
What the hell is this?

781
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:02,610
I know!

782
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:04,850
It's $5,000! And guess
what the note says?

783
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:08,880
It says to pay for the rental
on Mrs. Hayes's billboards.

784
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,280
Can you believe it?
That's why I butted in.

785
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:12,420
Who's it from?

786
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:13,790
Doesn't say.

787
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:16,360
- Well, where's the delivery boy?
- He went.

788
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,130
Did you see what company
he was from?

789
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:19,660
No.

790
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:22,260
What kind of uniform
did he have on?

791
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:23,500
Well, he just looked
like one of those

792
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,570
fat little Mexican boys.

793
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:27,140
On a bicycle.

794
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:31,510
Did I do
something wrong?

795
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:33,170
No, Pam,
you did good.

796
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:35,440
Yeah, Pamela,
you did real good.

797
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,610
Did I? Oh, great.

798
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:40,120
Ain't life crazy?

799
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:46,560
What's the note say, Red?

800
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:52,730
Says, "This here money
is to go towards the fund

801
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:54,490
"for Mildred Hayes's
billboards,

802
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,500
"because she ain't
the only one 'round here

"who hates the pigs.
Signed, a friend."

804
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:01,140
I guess you can't be too picky
about who your friends are

805
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:02,140
these days, huh?

806
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,940
Uh-huh, um...

807
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:07,810
I guess I'll be needing
a receipt off you there, Red,

808
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:09,640
you know, saying the price
of next month

809
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,740
is paid in full and all.

810
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:13,650
Oh, sure, Mildred, sure.

811
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:15,880
Like now.

812
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:16,950
Oh, sure.

813
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:22,920
Is Mommy drunk, Daddy?

814
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:25,760
No. She's just got a
little migraine, is all.

815
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,990
Little Chardonnay
migraine.

816
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,730
Now, no more chit-chat
outta you two, okay?

817
00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:34,830
Can we stay home from school
again tomorrow, Daddy?

818
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,940
We'll see what your mommy
says in the morning, darling.

819
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:39,340
Aw!

820
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:41,480
Eyes closed

821
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,680
and go to sleep, okay?

822
00:49:57,590 --> 00:50:01,360
You don't smell like puke,
which is good.

823
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:04,260
Aquafresh.
Trick I learned.

824
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:06,000
Women, huh?

825
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,840
But it's still your turn
to clean the horseshit

826
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,370
outta the stable,
you know.

827
00:50:11,370 --> 00:50:14,470
Those fucking horses.

828
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:15,980
They're your fucking horses.

829
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:18,250
I'm gonna have those
fucking horses shot!

830
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:23,180
I'll do it,
you lazy bitch.

831
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:24,820
Thank you, Poppa.

832
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:29,890
That was a real nice day.

833
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:34,030
That was a real nice fuck.

834
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:39,500
You got a real nice cock,
Mr. Willoughby.

835
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,040
Is that from a play?

836
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:48,080
"You got a real nice cock,
Mr. Willoughby."

837
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:52,050
I think I heard that
in a Shakespeare one time.

838
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:54,180
You dummy.

839
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:56,050
It's Oscar Wilde.

840
00:50:56,790 --> 00:50:57,790
Ah.

841
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,240
Oscar Wilde.

842

I've always loved you.</i>

847

848
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:42,220
<i>Tonight I've gone out

<i>although I know
that for a short time</i>

861

<i>No, this is a case,
in some senses, of bravery.</i>

862
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:17,720
<i>Not the bravery
of facing a bullet down.</i>

863
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:19,190
<i>The next few months of pain</i>

864
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:22,800
<i>would be far harder
than that small flash.</i>

865
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,970
<i>No, it's the bravery
of weighing up</i>

866

<i>the next few months

<i>I won't have that.</i>

874
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:51,590
<i>Your final memories of me

875
00:53:51,590 --> 00:53:55,700
<i>and that dumb fishing game,
which I think they cheated at,</i>

<i>That was the best, Anne.</i>

<i>and know that
I've always loved you,</i>

884
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:21,050
<i>and maybe I'll see you again
if there's another place.</i>

885
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:25,260
<i>And if there ain't, well,
it's been heaven knowing you.</i>

886

891
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:07,490
Yeah, I can stand.

892
00:56:10,730 --> 00:56:13,130
I'd better
get out there,

893
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:16,040
say something to them.

894
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:18,240

898

899

How about you, sweetheart?
You know who threw that can?

Uh, no, I didn't see.

What's your name?

Name's on my tag, man.

Hard of reading?
No, no.

943
01:00:57,490 --> 01:00:58,990
That's good,
"hard of reading".

944
01:00:58,990 --> 01:01:00,350
Kinda like
"hard of hearing",

945
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:02,690
but it's actually
"hard of reading".

946
01:01:02,690 --> 01:01:04,560
Like a play on words

You have got to be

01:01:17,570 --> 01:01:22,180
Do you have any documentation
to prove that, sir?

953
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:24,680
You really wanna see
my documentation, fucker?

954
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:29,180
Yeah, see his documentation!
Make him show it to you.

955
01:01:30,790 --> 01:01:33,520
None of you cracker motherfuckers

Ain't that racist?

01:01:43,470 --> 01:01:46,000
What happened to your hand,
Officer Dixon?

958
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,300
Oh, I just kinda

959
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:49,600
banged it up
a little bit

960
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:52,070
while I was throwing some guy
out a fucking window.

961
01:01:52,070 --> 01:01:53,910
You know, the usual.

962
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:54,910
Yeah?

963
01:01:54,910 --> 01:01:57,580
They never taught me
that one at the academy.

964
01:01:57,580 --> 01:02:00,250
Which fucking academy
you go to?

965
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:05,350
How are things coming along
on that Angela Hayes case?

966
01:02:05,350 --> 01:02:06,520
How's things coming along

967
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:08,450
on the mind your own
fucking business case?

968
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:09,790
How are things
coming along

969
01:02:09,790 --> 01:02:11,990
on the hand me your gun
and your badge?

970
01:02:15,970 --> 01:02:17,160
Huh?

971
01:02:17,170 --> 01:02:20,000
Hand me your gun
and your badge.

972
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:40,560
Shit.

973
01:02:54,170 --> 01:02:55,840
It's in here somewhere.

974
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:06,240
Hey, listen,
I can't find my badge.

975
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:08,320
No, seriously.
Maybe I lost it.

976
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:10,380
Dropped it when I was
doing that window guy.

977
01:03:10,390 --> 01:03:13,490
Just get the fuck out of
my station house, man.

978
01:03:38,250 --> 01:03:40,750
What's going on?

979
01:03:42,650 --> 01:03:45,520
I think I just got fired.

980
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:48,020
Fired or suspended,
I'm not sure which.

981
01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:49,390
Fired.

982
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:22,390
Anything I can help you with,
just give me a holler.

983
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:28,500
Give Mildred Hayes

984
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:30,930
a holler.

985
01:04:32,930 --> 01:04:34,100
Okay.

986
01:04:35,470 --> 01:04:37,200
You know me?

987
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:40,410
Only from the TV
and the radio.

988
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:49,550
How much these here

989
01:04:49,550 --> 01:04:51,780
"Welcome to Missouri"
rabbits go for?

990
01:04:51,790 --> 01:04:54,420
Seven bucks.
It's writ right on them.

991
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:04,600
Guess he ain't
seven bucks now.

992
01:05:06,770 --> 01:05:08,300
What did you
come in here for?

993
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:10,900
What did I
come in here for?

994
01:05:10,910 --> 01:05:13,640
Maybe I'm a good friend of
Willoughby's, how about that?

995
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:16,280
Are you?

996
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:17,750
Or, you know...

997
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:22,650
Maybe I was a friend of
your daughter or something.

998
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:24,720
How about that?

999
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:28,790
Were you?

1000
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:32,990
Or, um...

1001
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:36,530
You know,
maybe I was the one

1002
01:05:36,530 --> 01:05:39,130
who fucked her
while she was dying.

1003
01:05:39,130 --> 01:05:40,640
How about that?

1004
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:44,810
Were you?

1005
01:05:47,070 --> 01:05:48,180
No.

1006
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:51,110
I would have liked to.

1007
01:05:52,610 --> 01:05:54,210
I saw her picture
in the paper there.

1008
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:00,720
Saved by the bell, huh?

1009
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:03,360
You owe me seven fucking
dollars for the rabbit.

1010
01:06:04,830 --> 01:06:06,330
Guess you'll have to
get it off me

1011
01:06:06,330 --> 01:06:07,860
next time
I'm passing through.

1012
01:06:07,860 --> 01:06:09,000
Guess I will.

1013
01:06:18,740 --> 01:06:21,440
You don't know how
glad I am to see you.

1014
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:22,510
What?

1015
01:06:22,510 --> 01:06:24,040
That guy was
trying to scare me.

1016
01:06:24,050 --> 01:06:26,580
I wouldn't have said
you scare easy.

1017
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:28,080
I ain't the worst.

1018
01:06:29,580 --> 01:06:31,580
What can I do
for you, ma'am?

1019
01:06:31,590 --> 01:06:32,780
My husband
left this for you

1020
01:06:32,790 --> 01:06:35,490
before he shot himself
in the head last night.

1021
01:06:39,730 --> 01:06:41,290
I'm sorry,
Mrs. Willoughby...

1022
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:42,630
Are you?

1023
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:44,860
Are you really?

1024
01:06:44,870 --> 01:06:48,000
- Sure, I am.
- Surely this is the perfect ending for you, isn't it?

1025
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,240
Proof those billboards
of yours were successful,

1026
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:53,070
a dead policeman?

1027
01:06:53,070 --> 01:06:54,570
It's quantifiable now.

1028
01:06:54,580 --> 01:06:55,940
Are you blaming
this on me?

1029
01:06:55,940 --> 01:06:57,480
No.

1030
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:58,740
I'm not blaming
this on you.

1031
01:06:58,750 --> 01:07:00,820
I just came
to give you the letter.

1032
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:03,780
Now my little girls
are out in the car,

1033
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:06,650
so I'd better not
stay and chat.

1034
01:07:07,890 --> 01:07:09,350
I'm not quite sure
what we're gonna do

1035
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:10,890
for the rest of the day.

1036
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:14,590
It's hard to know
what to do

1037
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:17,430
the day your husband
kills himself.

1038
01:07:17,430 --> 01:07:19,000
It's hard to know
what to do.

1039
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:50,730
<i>Dear Mildred,</i>

1040
01:07:50,730 --> 01:07:52,800
<i>Dead Man Willoughby here.</i>

1041
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:55,130
<i>Firstly, I wanted
to apologize for dying</i>

1042
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:57,940
<i>without catching
your daughter's killer.</i>

1043
01:07:57,940 --> 01:07:59,670
<i>It's a source
of great pain to me,</i>

1044
01:07:59,670 --> 01:08:01,470
<i>and it would
break my heart to think</i>

1045
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:05,340
<i>you thought I didn't care.
I did.</i>

1046
01:08:05,350 --> 01:08:07,010
<i>There are just some cases</i>

1047
01:08:07,010 --> 01:08:09,680
<i>where you never
catch a break,</i>

1048
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:11,620
<i>then five years
down the line</i>

1049
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:13,620
<i>some guy hears
some other guy</i>

1050
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:17,560
<i>bragging about it
in a bar room or a jail cell</i>

1051
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:19,160
<i>and the whole thing
is wrapped up</i>

1052
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:20,960
<i>through sheer stupidity.</i>

1053
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:24,560
<i>I hope that might be true
for Angela, I really do.</i>

1054
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:27,230
<i>Second, I gotta admit,
Mildred,</i>

1055
01:08:27,230 --> 01:08:30,740
<i>the billboards were
a great fucking idea.</i>

1056
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:32,870
<i>They were like a chess move.</i>

1057
01:08:32,870 --> 01:08:35,170
<i>And although they had
absolutely nothing</i>

1058
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:36,710
<i>to do with my dying,</i>

1059
01:08:36,710 --> 01:08:38,440
<i>I'm sure that
everyone in town</i>

1060
01:08:38,450 --> 01:08:40,250
<i>will assume that they did,</i>

1061
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:42,820
<i>which is why, for
Willoughby's counter-move,</i>

1062
01:08:42,820 --> 01:08:45,850
<i>I decided to pay
the next month's rent on them.</i>

1063
01:08:45,850 --> 01:08:48,750
<i>I thought it would be funny,
you having to defend them</i>

1064
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:49,920
<i>another whole month</i>

1065
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:52,890
<i>after they've stuck me
in the ground.</i>

1066
01:08:52,890 --> 01:08:55,500
<i>The joke is on you,
Mildred, ha ha,</i>

1067
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:57,670
<i>and I hope
they do not kill you.</i>

1068
01:08:58,600 --> 01:08:59,970
<i>So good luck with all that,</i>

1069
01:08:59,970 --> 01:09:02,800
<i>and good luck
with everything else too.</i>

1070
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:06,810
<i>I hope and I pray
that you get him.</i>

1071
01:09:23,820 --> 01:09:27,760
Well, you want me to go
down and talk to them?

1072
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:30,700
No, I don't want you to
go down and talk to them.

1073
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:32,170
Somebody sending
their goddamn mother

1074
01:09:32,170 --> 01:09:34,240
down to talk
to the goddamn police?

1075
01:09:38,210 --> 01:09:39,570
To say what?

1076
01:09:39,570 --> 01:09:42,370
To say to give you
your job back.

1077
01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:43,910
Get rid
of that black guy.

1078
01:09:45,510 --> 01:09:46,910
Ain't gonna listen
to some guy's mother

1079
01:09:46,910 --> 01:09:49,120
asking them to get rid
of some black guy.

1080
01:09:50,050 --> 01:09:51,850
Things have moved on
in the South.

1081
01:09:51,850 --> 01:09:53,720
Well, it shouldn't have!

1082
01:09:55,190 --> 01:09:59,190
Will they give you some money
for being laid off and all?

1083
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:03,200
I don't know what the
compensation scheme is

1084
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:05,930
for when you throw a guy
out of a window, Ma.

1085
01:10:05,930 --> 01:10:07,670
Guess I should have
looked into that beforehand.

1086
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:09,840
Let me Google that.

1087
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:12,540
A couple of grand, maybe?

1088
01:10:12,540 --> 01:10:14,240
You been there three years.

1089
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:18,180
Not counting the five years
at the academy.

1090
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:20,680
Six,

1091
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:23,020
if you count the year
you were held back.

1092
01:10:25,490 --> 01:10:27,550
Where are you going?

1093
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:29,550
None of your business.

1094
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:31,990
Off to see your fancy woman?

1095
01:10:31,990 --> 01:10:33,560
I don't got a fancy woman.

1096
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:36,360
Yeah. I know.

1097
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:38,800
Hey, you wanna
watch yourself.

1098
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:41,040
Or, or you'll do what?

1099
01:10:44,370 --> 01:10:47,110
I'll blow your goddamn
head off, that's what.

1100
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:59,120
Oh,
did you hear the news?

1101
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:00,050
What news?

1102
01:11:00,050 --> 01:11:01,720
That Dixon guy
threw that Welby guy

1103
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:03,890
out of his window
this morning.

1104
01:11:03,890 --> 01:11:05,460
You're shitting me.

1105
01:11:10,630 --> 01:11:12,330
Is he okay?

1106
01:11:12,330 --> 01:11:13,530
Mmm-mmm.

1107
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:20,210
- You're shitting me!
- Whoa!

1108
01:11:20,210 --> 01:11:23,340
Holy shit!
Holy shit!

1109
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:25,350
Holy shit!

1110
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:27,350
Fuck!

1111
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:32,220
Get the other one
from the house.

1112
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:34,020
Shouldn't I call
the fire department?

1113
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:36,490
Fuck them.
They probably started it.

1114
01:11:36,490 --> 01:11:38,160
Don't do anything stupid!

1115
01:11:39,530 --> 01:11:40,960
Scumbags!

1116
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:43,370
Fucking, fucking scumbags!

1117
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,230
Shit!

1118
01:12:18,230 --> 01:12:19,530
All right!

1119
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:43,120
Are you kidding me?

1120
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:50,200
What the hell
are you doing?

1121
01:12:58,110 --> 01:12:59,710
Okay. Good. Come on.

1122
01:12:59,710 --> 01:13:01,440
Leave it! Ma, please!

1123
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:02,910
It's too late!

1124
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:07,750
- Robbie...
- Leave it! Please!

1125
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:09,180
Robbie!

1126
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:40,110
How are those hands?

1127
01:13:42,020 --> 01:13:44,150
Give us a minute here.
Thank you.

1128
01:13:47,390 --> 01:13:49,290
Can I ask you
a couple of questions?

1129
01:13:49,290 --> 01:13:51,060
You can ask me all the
questions you want,

1130
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:53,290
you take me down
and arrest me.

1131
01:13:53,290 --> 01:13:54,660
I'm not gonna arrest you,
Mrs. Hayes.

1132
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:56,230
I got nothing
to arrest you for.

1133
01:13:58,670 --> 01:14:00,270
Not yet you ain't.

1134
01:14:06,310 --> 01:14:08,510
We ain't all the enemy,
you know.

1135
01:14:26,290 --> 01:14:30,230
I'll crucify
the motherfuckers.

1136
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:43,170
What are
you gonna do, Mildred?

1137
01:14:43,180 --> 01:14:45,110
You gonna crucify them?

1138
01:14:45,110 --> 01:14:48,310
Yeah, I'm gonna crucify them.

1139
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:50,420
Who you gonna crucify?

1140
01:14:50,420 --> 01:14:52,520
The motherfuckers?

1141
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:54,650
Yeah, I'm gonna

1142
01:14:54,660 --> 01:14:57,090
crucify the motherfuckers.

1143
01:14:57,090 --> 01:14:59,160
Ooh, then those motherfuckers

1144
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:02,360
better watch out, all right?

1145
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:07,300
Fucking A.

1146
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:12,570
What's this shit?

1147
01:15:12,570 --> 01:15:14,410
And as sad as the spectacle

1148
01:15:14,410 --> 01:15:16,510
of these burned out
billboards might be,

1149
01:15:16,510 --> 01:15:18,280
in light of the death
of Chief Willoughby,

1150
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:19,850
this reporter for one

1151
01:15:19,850 --> 01:15:21,250
wonders if this
finally puts an end

1152
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:23,820
to the strange saga
of the three billboards...

1153
01:15:23,820 --> 01:15:26,120
This doesn't put an end
to shit, you fucking retard,

1154
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:27,750
this is just
the fucking start!

1155
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:28,990
Why don't you
put that on your

1156
01:15:28,990 --> 01:15:32,230
<i>Good Morning Missouri</i> fucking
<i>Wake Up</i> broadcast, bitch!

1157
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:44,270
I see on the TV there
were a bunch of fires

1158
01:15:44,270 --> 01:15:46,510
lit outside of town
last night.

1159
01:15:48,180 --> 01:15:49,780
Bunch of fires, huh?

1160
01:15:50,780 --> 01:15:53,050
Out at those billboards.

1161
01:15:54,580 --> 01:15:56,550
Back when I was a cop
I would have been

1162
01:15:56,550 --> 01:15:58,280
interested in
who set those fires,

1163
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:00,320
because, technically,
that's arson,

1164
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:02,220
but as I'm no longer
employed by those people,

1165
01:16:02,220 --> 01:16:04,760
I don't really
give a goddamn.

1166
01:16:07,660 --> 01:16:09,130
I'll get it.

1167
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:15,600
Dixon residence.

1168
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:17,570
<i>Hey, Dixon, it's Cedric.</i>

1169
01:16:17,570 --> 01:16:21,110
Oh, hey, Sarge.
You got any news?

1170
01:16:21,110 --> 01:16:23,240
- <i>News about what?</i>
- I don't know.

1171
01:16:25,110 --> 01:16:27,910
About my job and stuff?

1172
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:30,280
No. No. What?

1173
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:31,580
No.

1174
01:16:31,590 --> 01:16:35,190
Anne Willoughby
just dropped in a letter

1175
01:16:35,190 --> 01:16:36,920
that Bill wrote you
before he died.

1176
01:16:36,930 --> 01:16:38,320
What's it say?

1177
01:16:38,330 --> 01:16:40,990
I haven't read it,
it's not my letter.

1178
01:16:40,990 --> 01:16:42,930
Oh, well, listen,
I'll come right down.

1179
01:16:42,930 --> 01:16:45,560
Um, I'll be there
in like 15 minutes.

1180
01:16:45,570 --> 01:16:47,400
Well... Uh...

1181
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:52,940
Not such a great idea,
things as they stand, Jason.

1182
01:16:52,940 --> 01:16:54,370
<i>You still got your keys</i>

1183
01:16:54,380 --> 01:16:56,540
<i>to the station house,
though, right?</i>

1184
01:16:56,540 --> 01:16:57,510
Yeah.

1185
01:16:57,510 --> 01:16:59,950
<i>Why don't you
come and pick it up</i>

1186
01:16:59,950 --> 01:17:02,280
<i>after everyone's gone home?</i>

1187
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:04,520
<i>I can leave it
on your desk for you.</i>

1188
01:17:05,820 --> 01:17:07,220
Oh, okay.

1189
01:17:07,220 --> 01:17:08,760
<i>Actually, yeah, then</i>

1190
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:11,560
when you're done, you can

1191
01:17:12,230 --> 01:17:14,630
just leave the keys,

1192
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:17,300
you know, save us
picking them up later.

1193
01:17:19,930 --> 01:17:21,270
All right.

1194
01:17:48,700 --> 01:17:51,000
<i>Jason, Willoughby here.</i>

1195
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,460
<i>I'm dead now,
sorry about that.</i>

1196
01:17:53,470 --> 01:17:55,170
<i>There's something
I wanted to say to you</i>

1197
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:57,670
<i>that I never really said
when I was alive.</i>

1198
01:17:59,140 --> 01:18:00,670
<i>I think you've got the makings</i>

1199
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:03,740
<i>of being
a really good cop, Jason.</i>

1200
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:05,210
<i>And you know why?</i>

1201
01:18:06,450 --> 01:18:10,350
<i>Because deep down
you're a decent man.</i>

1202
01:18:10,350 --> 01:18:12,420
<i>I know you don't think
I think that,</i>

1203
01:18:12,420 --> 01:18:14,450
<i>but I do, dipshit.</i>

1204
01:18:21,460 --> 01:18:23,930
<i>I do think
you're too angry, though.</i>

1205
01:18:26,570 --> 01:18:28,470
<i>And I know it's all
since your dad died,</i>

1206
01:18:28,470 --> 01:18:31,440
<i>and you had to go
look after your mom.</i>

1207
01:18:34,180 --> 01:18:37,310
<i>But as long as you hold on
to so much hate,</i>

1208
01:18:37,310 --> 01:18:40,110
<i>then I don't think
you're ever gonna become</i>

1209
01:18:40,110 --> 01:18:42,450
<i>what I know
you wanna become.</i>

1210
01:18:45,050 --> 01:18:46,590
<i>A detective.</i>

1211
01:18:52,730 --> 01:18:55,190
<i>Because you know what you
need to become a detective?</i>

1212
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:59,100
<i>And I know you're gonna wince
when I say this...</i>

1213
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:06,470
<i>But what you need to become
a detective is love.</i>

1214
01:19:07,210 --> 01:19:08,410
Fuck 'em.

1215
01:19:15,550 --> 01:19:18,220
<i>Because through love
comes calm,</i>

1216
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:20,850
<i>and through calm
comes thought.</i>

1217
01:19:20,850 --> 01:19:24,730
<i>And you need thought to detect
stuff sometimes, Jason.</i>

1218
01:19:30,230 --> 01:19:32,260
<i>It's kinda all you need.</i>

1219
01:19:32,270 --> 01:19:33,830
<i>You don't even need a gun.</i>

1220
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:36,470
<i>And you definitely
don't need hate.</i>

1221
01:19:36,470 --> 01:19:38,440
<i>Hate never solved nothing.</i>

1222
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:45,840
<i>But calm did.
And thought did.</i>

1223
01:19:45,850 --> 01:19:48,720
<i>Try it. Try it
just for a change.</i>

1224
01:19:50,420 --> 01:19:51,980
<i>No one will think
you're gay.</i>

1225
01:19:51,990 --> 01:19:55,290
<i>And if they do,
arrest them for homophobia.</i>

1226
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:58,320
<i>Won't they be surprised.</i>

1227
01:19:58,330 --> 01:20:01,430
<i>Good luck to you, Jason,
you're a decent man.</i>

1228
01:20:01,430 --> 01:20:04,300
<i>And yeah, you've had
a run of bad luck,</i>

1229
01:20:05,530 --> 01:20:09,000
<i>but things are gonna change for you.
I can feel it.</i>

1230
01:20:39,030 --> 01:20:40,100
Calm.

1231
01:20:41,170 --> 01:20:42,470
Calm.

1232
01:20:43,900 --> 01:20:44,970
Calm.

1233
01:22:05,890 --> 01:22:06,920
What did you see?

1234
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:09,420
When we turned the corner
from Spring,

1235
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:11,790
the fire was
already raging, and

1236
01:22:11,790 --> 01:22:13,930
about two seconds later
the cop fella,

1237
01:22:13,930 --> 01:22:15,290
he just jumps
out of the window.

1238
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:19,170
Wait... The two of you turned
the corner from Spring?

1239
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:21,470
Where were you
before this?

1240
01:22:21,470 --> 01:22:22,900
Round my place.

1241
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:28,010
You two boyfriend
and girlfriend?

1242
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:32,110
Early stages, you know.

1243
01:22:33,550 --> 01:22:35,080
Is that right?

1244
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:36,750
We had a couple of dates.

1245
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:49,100
You wanna go out to
dinner with me next week?

1246
01:22:50,430 --> 01:22:52,630
Yeah, I'll go out
to dinner with you.

1247
01:22:55,270 --> 01:22:56,900
But I ain't gonna
fuck you.

1248
01:22:57,900 --> 01:23:00,780
Well, I... I ain't gonna
fuck you neither.

1249
01:23:03,180 --> 01:23:04,650
I guess.

1250
01:23:18,990 --> 01:23:22,160
Burn victim. He's
pretty heavily sedated.

1251
01:23:31,470 --> 01:23:34,340
Hey, man.
You doing okay?

1252
01:23:34,340 --> 01:23:38,810
Jeez, you got burned up
pretty bad, huh?

1253
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:42,820
You'll be okay though.

1254
01:23:43,850 --> 01:23:46,590
You want a glass
of orange juice?

1255
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:48,950
I got a straw somewhere.

1256
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:51,830
Hey, hey...

1257
01:23:52,930 --> 01:23:54,190
Don't cry.

1258
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:57,830
You'll be okay.

1259
01:24:00,670 --> 01:24:02,740
I'm sorry, Welby.

1260
01:24:06,210 --> 01:24:07,310
You know me?

1261
01:24:07,310 --> 01:24:08,680
I'm sorry.

1262
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:13,050
You're sorry for what?

1263
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:16,720
Throwing you
out the window.

1264
01:24:24,260 --> 01:24:25,490
Sorry.

1265
01:24:25,490 --> 01:24:27,430
I don't care!

1266
01:24:27,430 --> 01:24:30,430
Stop fucking crying,
God damn it!

1267
01:24:30,430 --> 01:24:32,800
The salt will just
fuck up your wounds.

1268
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:35,730
I thought it was
good for wounds.

1269
01:24:35,740 --> 01:24:37,940
What am I,
a fucking doctor?

1270
01:25:47,510 --> 01:25:48,840
Who is it?

1271
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:50,940
Oh, you don't
know me really.

1272
01:25:53,710 --> 01:25:55,850
Well, what do you want?

1273
01:25:55,850 --> 01:25:58,180
I come about the billboards.

1274
01:25:58,190 --> 01:25:59,520
What about them?

1275
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:01,090
They got burned up.

1276
01:26:01,090 --> 01:26:02,890
I know that.

1277
01:26:02,890 --> 01:26:05,960
I'm one of the guys who put
them up in the first place.

1278
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:10,830
Jerome.

1279
01:26:12,630 --> 01:26:14,330
What can I do
for you, Jerome?

1280
01:26:14,330 --> 01:26:16,600
When you put up a bunch
of posters like that...

1281
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:20,170
Just in case any of them get
screwed up or torn, they...

1282
01:26:20,170 --> 01:26:22,840
Give you a set of
duplicates, you know?

1283
01:26:23,810 --> 01:26:25,450
No, I didn't know that.

1284
01:26:34,020 --> 01:26:37,020
Ladder's pretty steady
as it is there, James.

1285
01:26:38,690 --> 01:26:41,230
That's okay.
I like holding ladders.

1286
01:26:41,230 --> 01:26:42,360
Takes me out of myself.

1287
01:26:47,630 --> 01:26:49,130
- Need a hand?
- Hey.

1288
01:26:50,170 --> 01:26:52,540
- When did you get out?
- An hour ago.

1289
01:26:52,540 --> 01:26:53,770
Judge threw it out.

1290
01:26:53,770 --> 01:26:55,410
Said the arrest report
weren't filled out right.

1291
01:26:55,410 --> 01:26:56,880
Mmm.

1292
01:26:57,380 --> 01:26:58,410
Say, you...

1293
01:27:02,150 --> 01:27:04,950
You didn't burn down the
police station, did you?

1294
01:27:04,950 --> 01:27:07,320
No, she was with me
the whole night.

1295
01:27:09,260 --> 01:27:11,420
- Why would you...
- It's a long story.

1296
01:27:11,430 --> 01:27:12,930
Hey.

1297
01:27:13,260 --> 01:27:15,060
Hey.

1298
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:16,730
Still wanna put up
the Willoughby one,

1299
01:27:16,730 --> 01:27:18,300
him being dead and all?

1300
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:20,700
Why not?
He paid for it.

1301
01:27:20,700 --> 01:27:22,000
True.

1302
01:27:33,910 --> 01:27:36,320
Look at this
fucking asshole.

1303
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:13,920
- First round is on you?
- Yeah.

1304
01:28:29,900 --> 01:28:31,440
Well, here we are.

1305
01:28:33,610 --> 01:28:35,210
Here we are.

1306
01:28:37,410 --> 01:28:38,910
I like cheesy things.

1307
01:28:38,910 --> 01:28:40,850
I'm gonna look
for cheesy things.

1308
01:28:41,780 --> 01:28:43,020
All right.

1309
01:28:49,790 --> 01:28:51,620
Who's that?

1310
01:28:51,630 --> 01:28:53,190
My ex-husband.

1311
01:28:53,190 --> 01:28:55,430
And his
19-year-old girlfriend.

1312
01:28:58,660 --> 01:28:59,800
You wanna leave?

1313
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:02,270
No, no. Deal's a deal.

1314
01:29:04,810 --> 01:29:06,100
It was fucking wild.

1315
01:29:06,110 --> 01:29:08,370
I think I was certifiably
fucking insane

1316
01:29:08,380 --> 01:29:09,510
for a while back then.

1317
01:29:10,240 --> 01:29:11,840
When was this?

1318
01:29:11,850 --> 01:29:13,450
About nine,
ten months ago.

1319
01:29:13,450 --> 01:29:14,450
Were you on your own?

1320
01:29:14,450 --> 01:29:16,420
I had a couple
of buddies with me.

1321
01:29:16,420 --> 01:29:18,420
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1322
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:20,590
They fuck her too?

1323
01:29:20,590 --> 01:29:23,720
I think they got their
kicks just watching, you know.

1324
01:29:23,720 --> 01:29:25,290
Oh, yeah?

1325
01:29:25,290 --> 01:29:26,490
Yeah.

1326
01:29:26,490 --> 01:29:27,760
Was she hot?

1327
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:30,000
Once the gasoline
kicked in she was hot.

1328
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:32,830
Swear, I wanted
to fuck her even more

1329
01:29:32,830 --> 01:29:34,370
right then and there.

1330
01:29:35,970 --> 01:29:38,540
I don't know if I could
get that out of my mind.

1331
01:30:19,750 --> 01:30:21,110
I ain't going down
for that shit,

1332
01:30:21,110 --> 01:30:23,080
last fucking day
down there.

1333
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:32,190
He been there
the whole time?

1334
01:30:32,190 --> 01:30:33,330
Who?

1335
01:30:33,330 --> 01:30:36,430
Burnt face Jake. Keeps
fucking walking up and down.

1336
01:30:36,430 --> 01:30:38,370
I don't know.
I don't think so.

1337
01:30:46,670 --> 01:30:48,140
- Another round?
- Yeah.

1338
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:53,010
Eight bucks.

1339
01:31:25,310 --> 01:31:26,410
Maestro.

1340
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:32,950
Can I help you
with something?

1341
01:31:32,950 --> 01:31:34,490
Excuse me?

1342
01:31:34,490 --> 01:31:36,250
Looking over here
all fucking night.

1343
01:31:36,260 --> 01:31:38,220
Unless you've got
something to say,

1344
01:31:38,230 --> 01:31:39,920
why don't you take
your burnt fucking face

1345
01:31:39,930 --> 01:31:41,260
and get the fuck
out of here?

1346
01:31:44,430 --> 01:31:45,760
What are you doing?

1347
01:31:45,770 --> 01:31:48,530
Wait, wait, wait...

1348
01:31:48,530 --> 01:31:52,170
Just trust me, okay?
Do you like magic?

1349
01:31:55,710 --> 01:31:56,840
Just trust me.

1350
01:31:56,840 --> 01:31:58,480
Just do the fucking
trick, man.

1351
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:01,310
Okay.

1352
01:32:10,120 --> 01:32:11,320
What the fuck!

1353
01:32:14,230 --> 01:32:15,300
Hey.

1354
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:17,530
Hey!

1355
01:32:17,530 --> 01:32:19,860
- That's enough!
- What's it to you, fucker?

1356
01:32:19,870 --> 01:32:21,100
Guy is a cop, man.
He's a cop.

1357
01:32:21,100 --> 01:32:23,270
Oh, yeah?

1358
01:32:23,270 --> 01:32:24,740
He ain't wearing
no badge.

1359
01:32:25,470 --> 01:32:26,770
I lost my badge.

1360
01:32:28,370 --> 01:32:30,470
Can't remember
where I lost it.

1361
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:33,280
You started this.
I didn't do shit to you!

1362
01:32:34,010 --> 01:32:35,550
I know I started it.

1363
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:38,150
I scratched you up
like a bitch.

1364
01:32:38,150 --> 01:32:39,920
That's exactly
fucking right.

1365
01:32:56,670 --> 01:32:58,810
I'm gonna go use
the little boy's room.

1366
01:33:10,220 --> 01:33:11,520
You got something
to say to me?

1367
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:13,450
If I'd known, we could
have double dated.

1368
01:33:13,450 --> 01:33:16,550
Doesn't shit girl
have a curfew weeknights?

1369
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:17,720
No.

1370
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:20,890
I was gonna take her
to the circus later,

1371
01:33:20,890 --> 01:33:22,090
but there's no need now.

1372
01:33:22,100 --> 01:33:23,500
Does he juggle?

1373
01:33:23,500 --> 01:33:27,030
I'm having dinner
because he did me a favor.

1374
01:33:27,030 --> 01:33:28,970
You don't
have to explain

1375
01:33:28,970 --> 01:33:30,540
why you're having dinner
with a midget.

1376
01:33:30,540 --> 01:33:32,500
I'm not explaining
myself to you.

1377
01:33:32,510 --> 01:33:33,770
You kind of are.

1378
01:33:38,710 --> 01:33:41,210
I didn't come here
to break your balls.

1379
01:33:41,210 --> 01:33:43,650
You can date as many
midgets as you want.

1380
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:48,720
I came to say
I was sorry, actually.

1381
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:50,350
Sorry for what?

1382
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:52,490
Sorry about what happened
to your billboards and all.

1383
01:33:52,490 --> 01:33:55,690
It's all water under
the bridge, I guess.

1384
01:33:55,690 --> 01:33:57,060
Good.

1385
01:33:57,060 --> 01:33:58,560
I'm glad.
I was pretty drunk,

1386
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:01,230
but it still
don't excuse it.

1387
01:34:02,970 --> 01:34:05,500
All this anger, man.

1388
01:34:05,510 --> 01:34:08,440
Penelope said to me
the other day...

1389
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:11,510
"It just begets
greater anger."

1390
01:34:12,150 --> 01:34:14,720
You know? It's true.

1391
01:34:17,320 --> 01:34:19,220
Penelope
said "begets"?

1392
01:34:20,650 --> 01:34:21,720
Yeah.

1393
01:34:22,490 --> 01:34:25,220
"It begets
greater anger."

1394
01:34:28,030 --> 01:34:29,760
Well...

1395
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:33,060
You take care of this
little lady, okay, sport?

1396
01:34:33,070 --> 01:34:35,740
Big lady
compared to you, right?

1397
01:34:45,310 --> 01:34:48,210
- You all right?
- I think I wanna go home now.

1398
01:34:48,210 --> 01:34:49,410
Don't give me
any shit, James.

1399
01:34:49,410 --> 01:34:51,480
We'll do it another night,
all right?

1400
01:34:52,280 --> 01:34:54,150
Why would I want to?

1401
01:34:54,150 --> 01:34:57,660
You've been embarrassed
ever since we arrived.

1402
01:34:57,660 --> 01:35:00,160
For Christ sake.
I didn't force you

1403
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:03,200
to come on this date.
You forced me.

1404
01:35:04,930 --> 01:35:06,330
Forced you?

1405
01:35:07,530 --> 01:35:09,670
I asked you on a date.

1406
01:35:09,670 --> 01:35:12,100
Wow. You know...

1407
01:35:12,100 --> 01:35:16,410
I know I'm
not that much of a catch.

1408
01:35:16,410 --> 01:35:18,840
I know I'm a dwarf
who sells used cars

1409
01:35:18,850 --> 01:35:20,980
and has a drinking problem.

1410
01:35:20,980 --> 01:35:22,580
But who the hell
are you, man?

1411
01:35:22,580 --> 01:35:24,820
You're that
billboard lady who

1412
01:35:24,820 --> 01:35:25,920
never smiles,

1413
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:28,290
never has a good word
to say about anybody,

1414
01:35:28,290 --> 01:35:30,090
and who,
in the evening times,

1415
01:35:30,090 --> 01:35:31,890
sets fucking fire
to police stations!

1416
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:36,760
And I'm the one
who's not a catch?

1417
01:35:38,730 --> 01:35:39,770
Hey!

1418
01:35:41,570 --> 01:35:45,240
You know, I didn't have to
come and hold your ladder.

1419
01:36:10,900 --> 01:36:12,570
Now, don't make a scene.

1420
01:36:15,070 --> 01:36:18,900
Did you really tell him
"Anger begets greater anger"?

1421
01:36:18,900 --> 01:36:20,770
Oh! Yes! I did.

1422
01:36:20,770 --> 01:36:22,370
I didn't make it up
myself though.

1423
01:36:22,380 --> 01:36:23,610
I can't claim that.

1424
01:36:23,610 --> 01:36:26,010
No, I read it
on a bookmark.

1425
01:36:27,610 --> 01:36:29,650
Which was in a book
I was reading.

1426
01:36:31,020 --> 01:36:32,490
About polio.

1427
01:36:33,620 --> 01:36:36,390
Polo. No. Which is the
one with the horses?

1428
01:36:36,390 --> 01:36:37,720
Polio or polo?

1429
01:36:37,720 --> 01:36:38,990
- Polo.
- Polo.

1430
01:36:50,040 --> 01:36:51,840
Be nice to her,
Charlie.

1431
01:36:53,770 --> 01:36:55,010
You got that?

1432
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:10,420
Jason!

1433
01:37:10,420 --> 01:37:12,090
- Jason.
- Don't look at me.

1434
01:37:12,090 --> 01:37:13,220
What have they
done to you?

1435
01:37:13,230 --> 01:37:14,430
Leave me, Momma.

1436
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:17,030
No. No!

1437
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:21,800
Open up this door!

1438
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:24,070
Please, Jason.

1439
01:37:24,970 --> 01:37:27,610
I love you. Please.

1440
01:37:30,180 --> 01:37:33,980
You're my baby boy.
Open this door.

1441
01:37:34,810 --> 01:37:35,980
Please.

1442
01:37:38,050 --> 01:37:40,150
Jason, please.

1443
01:37:43,260 --> 01:37:44,590
Please.

1444
01:37:45,190 --> 01:37:47,790
Please open the door.

1445
01:37:55,940 --> 01:37:57,540
Open up!

1446
01:37:59,200 --> 01:38:01,770
Jason!

1447
01:38:01,770 --> 01:38:05,810
I'm all right, Momma.
It's all gonna be all right.

1448
01:38:29,770 --> 01:38:31,440
I don't wanna get your
hopes up, all right,

1449
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:33,200
but there is a guy,
and I think

1450
01:38:33,210 --> 01:38:36,710
he might be the guy.
I got his DNA.

1451
01:38:36,710 --> 01:38:38,780
Got a lot of it,
actually.

1452
01:38:38,780 --> 01:38:41,150
They're making the checks
as we speak.

1453
01:38:41,150 --> 01:38:42,880
He's in jail?

1454
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:46,580
No, but he ain't
gonna be hard to find.

1455
01:38:46,590 --> 01:38:48,180
Why do you think
he's the guy?

1456
01:38:48,190 --> 01:38:49,390
I heard him
talking about

1457
01:38:49,390 --> 01:38:52,290
something he did
to a girl last year.

1458
01:38:52,290 --> 01:38:54,130
I couldn't hear
all of it, but...

1459
01:38:55,460 --> 01:38:58,830
It sounded a lot like
what happened to Angela.

1460
01:38:59,930 --> 01:39:02,070
And then he beat
the crap out of me.

1461
01:39:02,070 --> 01:39:03,630
But because of that,

1462
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:05,640
I got a bunch of his DNA.

1463
01:39:06,370 --> 01:39:07,940
So, I wanted to

1464
01:39:08,810 --> 01:39:11,380
let you know sooner
rather than later.

1465
01:39:11,380 --> 01:39:13,180
I didn't want you
to give up hope.

1466
01:39:14,610 --> 01:39:16,580
I've been trying
not to.

1467
01:39:16,580 --> 01:39:20,380
Well...
All you can do is try.

1468
01:39:20,390 --> 01:39:22,520
As my momma says,

1469
01:39:22,520 --> 01:39:24,660
it's not so much
about hope as about...

1470
01:39:26,490 --> 01:39:27,890
Well, I didn't used to be

1471
01:39:27,890 --> 01:39:29,890
very good at English
at school.

1472
01:39:29,900 --> 01:39:31,560
So it was more
"All you can do is try

1473
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:34,200
"to not be so crap
at English."

1474
01:39:36,900 --> 01:39:40,540
Because you need English,
really, if you wanna be a cop.

1475
01:39:40,540 --> 01:39:43,210
If you wanna be
anything, really.

1476
01:39:49,450 --> 01:39:51,920
Unless you live in Mexico
or something.

1477
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:54,590
Who wants that?

1478
01:40:15,610 --> 01:40:16,810
Hey, Dixon?

1479
01:40:22,220 --> 01:40:23,250
Thank you.

1480
01:40:57,280 --> 01:40:58,990
You did good, Jason.

1481
01:40:59,590 --> 01:41:01,190
You did real good.

1482
01:41:10,100 --> 01:41:11,760
But he wasn't the guy.

1483
01:41:19,240 --> 01:41:20,470
What?

1484
01:41:20,470 --> 01:41:22,610
There was no match
to the DNA.

1485
01:41:22,610 --> 01:41:25,440
No matches to any other
crimes of this nature.

1486
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:28,180
To any crimes at all,
in fact.

1487
01:41:28,180 --> 01:41:29,880
And his record is clean.

1488
01:41:30,820 --> 01:41:32,590
Maybe he was
just bragging.

1489
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:34,650
He wasn't just bragging.

1490
01:41:34,650 --> 01:41:36,390
Well, that's as may be.

1491
01:41:36,390 --> 01:41:38,690
But at the time
of Angela's death,

1492
01:41:38,690 --> 01:41:40,960
he wasn't even
in the country.

1493
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:42,360
Where was he?

1494
01:41:42,360 --> 01:41:45,430
I've seen his records of entry
and exit to the States,

1495
01:41:45,430 --> 01:41:48,370
and spoken to his CO.

1496
01:41:48,370 --> 01:41:51,840
He wasn't in the country,
Dixon. He ain't our guy.

1497
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:54,310
No, he

1498
01:41:56,580 --> 01:41:57,940
might not be our guy,

1499
01:41:57,940 --> 01:41:59,710
but he still done
something shitty.

1500
01:41:59,710 --> 01:42:00,910
I know he did.

1501
01:42:00,910 --> 01:42:02,780
Not in Missouri
he didn't.

1502
01:42:03,420 --> 01:42:04,620
Where was he?

1503
01:42:04,620 --> 01:42:07,220
That's
classified information.

1504
01:42:07,220 --> 01:42:09,090
Oh, come on, man.

1505
01:42:09,090 --> 01:42:11,760
If the guy
has a commanding officer,

1506
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:13,490
and if the guy
got back to the country

1507
01:42:13,490 --> 01:42:14,690
nine months ago,

1508
01:42:14,690 --> 01:42:17,790
and if the country
where he was is classified,

1509
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:20,170
which country
do you think he was in?

1510
01:42:21,500 --> 01:42:23,200
Hey, you know...

1511
01:42:25,370 --> 01:42:26,810
I'll give you a clue.

1512
01:42:28,540 --> 01:42:30,140
It was sandy.

1513
01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:36,350
That doesn't really
narrow it down.

1514
01:42:38,620 --> 01:42:40,620
All you need
to know is that

1515
01:42:40,620 --> 01:42:42,690
he didn't do nothing
to Angela Hayes.

1516
01:42:42,690 --> 01:42:45,230
So, we're gonna
keep looking.

1517
01:42:51,260 --> 01:42:52,330
All right?

1518
01:43:03,410 --> 01:43:05,340
I found my badge
after all.

1519
01:44:13,110 --> 01:44:14,180
Hello?

1520
01:44:14,780 --> 01:44:16,080
<i>It's Dixon.</i>

1521
01:44:21,320 --> 01:44:22,760
Tell me.

1522
01:44:25,460 --> 01:44:27,220
He weren't the guy.

1523
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:44,310
Mildred?

1524
01:44:54,590 --> 01:44:56,060
Are you sure?

1525
01:44:57,660 --> 01:45:01,490
He... He weren't even in
the country when it happened.

1526
01:45:03,100 --> 01:45:08,170
So, whatever he did,
he didn't do it round here.

1527
01:45:09,640 --> 01:45:12,200
<i>I'm sorry I got
your hopes up.</i>

1528
01:45:12,200 --> 01:45:14,270
That's all right.
That's all right.

1529
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:18,310
At least I had
a day of hoping,

1530
01:45:18,310 --> 01:45:20,850
and that's more
than I've had for a while.

1531
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:28,820
I gotta go.

1532
01:45:32,590 --> 01:45:34,030
There was, uh...

1533
01:45:35,560 --> 01:45:37,830
There was one thing
I was thinking.

1534
01:45:40,470 --> 01:45:41,840
<i>What's that?</i>

1535
01:45:42,600 --> 01:45:44,470
I know he ain't
your rapist.

1536
01:45:45,810 --> 01:45:49,910
He is a rapist, though.
I'm sure of that.

1537
01:45:58,120 --> 01:45:59,850
What are you
saying to me?

1538
01:46:01,990 --> 01:46:03,620
Got his license plate.

1539
01:46:06,760 --> 01:46:08,490
I know where he lives.

1540
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:12,930
Where's he live?

1541
01:46:14,830 --> 01:46:16,340
He lives in Idaho.

1542
01:46:22,640 --> 01:46:23,980
That's funny.

1543
01:46:27,110 --> 01:46:29,380
I'm driving to Idaho
in the morning.

1544
01:46:34,950 --> 01:46:36,460
Want some company?

1545
01:46:42,190 --> 01:46:43,260
Sure.

1546
01:49:25,290 --> 01:49:27,530
- Hey, Dixon?
- Yeah?

1547
01:49:28,860 --> 01:49:30,260
I need to tell you
something.

1548
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:35,370
It was me that burned down
the police station.

1549
01:49:37,640 --> 01:49:40,310
Why, who the hell else
would it have been?

1550
01:49:52,380 --> 01:49:53,650
Dixon?

1551
01:49:54,350 --> 01:49:55,850
Yeah?

1552
01:49:55,850 --> 01:49:57,750
Are you sure
about this?

1553
01:49:57,760 --> 01:49:59,560
About killing this guy?

1554
01:50:02,030 --> 01:50:04,260
Not really. You?

1555
01:50:07,630 --> 01:50:09,230
Not really.

1556
01:50:11,540 --> 01:50:13,810
I guess we can decide
along the way.

1557
