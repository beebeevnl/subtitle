that was our boy.

since he was old enough

I didn't stop him, though,

or the worth of the junk in
the trunk once he dumped it,

469
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,150

I made sure to tell him who I was,

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,950
what I was capable of,
and how much he owed me.

And since he's
been paying me back,

472

he's also shown me
what he's capable of.

By the time this job is over,
you'll be rolling in money,

942
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:35,370
buying Maseratis and feeding

943
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:36,700

No, Doc.

948

exact same crew twice, right?

949

Yes.

for every job since we met.
