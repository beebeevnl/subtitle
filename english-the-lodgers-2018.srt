[INAUDIBLE WHISPERING]

500
00:51:45,885 --> 00:51:46,886
Wait!

501
00:51:49,655 --> 00:51:52,191
I thought you wanted me to?

502
00:51:54,493 --> 00:51:56,496
I can feel eyes on me.

503
00:51:59,564 --> 00:52:00,566
Rachel,

504
00:52:01,334 --> 00:52:03,533
there's no one here.

505
00:52:03,535 --> 00:52:06,370
We're never alone.

506
00:52:06,372 --> 00:52:10,477
Young man, this house is
in a state of dereliction.

507
00:52:11,877 --> 00:52:13,711
We live simply here.

508
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:15,946
Simply?

509
00:52:15,948 --> 00:52:18,682
You live in squalor!

510
00:52:18,684 --> 00:52:20,984
It's clear management
of this property is

511
00:52:20,986 --> 00:52:23,389
beyond you and your sister.

512
00:52:24,356 --> 00:52:27,323
EDWARD: You'd have us leave?

513
00:52:27,325 --> 00:52:30,196
I see no option, but
for you to do so.

514
00:52:36,702 --> 00:52:39,970
RACHEL: Our ancestors fled where
they came from to this place,

515
00:52:39,972 --> 00:52:42,038
where nobody knew,

516
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:43,973
they built this house
to hide their shame,

517
00:52:43,975 --> 00:52:48,011
but their shame took form
and it punished them.

518
00:52:48,013 --> 00:52:50,848
They'll never be free of it.

519
00:52:50,850 --> 00:52:53,417
We'll never be free of them.

520
00:52:53,419 --> 00:52:54,554
Free of who?

521
00:52:55,821 --> 00:52:58,488
They live below
and we live above.

522
00:52:58,490 --> 00:53:01,491
The day is ours,
the night is theirs

523
00:53:01,493 --> 00:53:03,294
and as long as we
keep to the rules

524
00:53:03,296 --> 00:53:05,662
that's how it remains but

525
00:53:05,664 --> 00:53:06,999
now we're of age.

526
00:53:09,834 --> 00:53:11,868
I feel them pressing at us.

527
00:53:11,870 --> 00:53:15,474
Rachel, who lives with
you in that house?

528
00:53:16,975 --> 00:53:21,078
Some of these items
could surely be sold.

529
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:25,582
Clean and restored they
would fetch a price.

530
00:53:25,584 --> 00:53:29,520
This, for instance,
might be a fine piece.

531
00:53:29,522 --> 00:53:31,925
Flemish, perhaps 17th century.

532
00:53:39,397 --> 00:53:43,667
Surely, there are other
properties in the family,

533
00:53:43,669 --> 00:53:44,871
other holdings?

534
00:53:47,539 --> 00:53:48,671
That ceiling is near

535
00:53:48,673 --> 00:53:52,611
eaten through with
damp, young man.

536
00:53:55,046 --> 00:53:58,649
Clearly, this house
is beyond you.

537
00:53:58,651 --> 00:54:03,821
A return to England perhaps
might be the soundest idea.

538
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:07,390
EDWARD: We aren't
English, Mr. Bermingham.

539
00:54:07,392 --> 00:54:09,026
Not English by birth perhaps,

540
00:54:09,028 --> 00:54:13,332
but for all intents
and purposes...

541
00:54:30,015 --> 00:54:32,618
There's no name for what we are.

542

[REPEATED SLASHING]

543
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:47,430
Rachel, what you're
telling me, it's a story

544
00:54:47,432 --> 00:54:49,566
to scare children,
to make them behave.

545
00:54:49,568 --> 00:54:52,002
It's no better than the stories
they tell in the village.

546
00:54:52,004 --> 00:54:53,636
And what would you know?

547
00:54:53,638 --> 00:54:55,104
Was it a story that
drove my mother

548
00:54:55,106 --> 00:54:57,774
and father into
the lake and theirs?

549
00:54:57,776 --> 00:54:59,810
Is it a story that has
my brother and I locked

550
00:54:59,812 --> 00:55:01,845
into our bedrooms each night?

551
00:55:01,847 --> 00:55:03,881
It's a punishment.

552
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:05,582
Our parents followed
all the rules,

553
00:55:05,584 --> 00:55:07,417
taught us to follow
them but in the end,

554
00:55:07,419 --> 00:55:08,486
they couldn't bare it!

555
00:55:08,488 --> 00:55:10,720
And when we've fulfilled
our purpose like they did,

556
00:55:10,722 --> 00:55:11,888
we'll go the same way.

557
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:14,591
Do you think I want
to live like this?

558
00:55:14,593 --> 00:55:15,725
Afraid to live,

559
00:55:15,727 --> 00:55:18,731
afraid to touch
anything that lives!

560

Rachel,

562
00:55:28,039 --> 00:55:30,506
you make your own fate.

563
00:55:30,508 --> 00:55:32,511
Nobody is cursed to die.

564
00:55:35,548 --> 00:55:36,816
Cursed to die?

565
00:55:39,651 --> 00:55:41,453
Our curse is to live.

566
00:55:45,524 --> 00:55:46,526

It was the bird.

596
00:59:38,923 --> 00:59:40,192
It scratched me.

They've been in our room.

You, you brought Bermingham
into the house, didn't you?

- Rachel, I had to do it.

They don't have to hurt
us if we only obey.

There's only
the master bedroom now.

You'll never survive out there.

Rachel?

618
01:04:10,662 --> 01:04:13,232
Don't even say her name, Sean.

619

See who that is, mam.

620
01:04:16,501 --> 01:04:18,037
I'll tend to him.

01:04:28,714 --> 01:04:30,145
It's you.

What do you want?

01:04:31,216 --> 01:04:32,249
I've come to see your son.

Come to see the damage
you've done, have you?

01:04:35,019 --> 01:04:36,285
Tell him I'm here, please.

I know what you're like!

627
01:04:37,421 --> 01:04:39,089
Tell him I'm sorry
for what I said.

628
01:04:39,091 --> 01:04:40,991
I'll tell him nothing from you.

Washing the filth
out of your sheets,

your parents and

01:04:44,729 --> 01:04:47,129
You think I don't know
what goes on in that place?

01:04:47,131 --> 01:04:48,497
I need his help.

633
01:04:48,499 --> 01:04:50,265
There's only one thing
you're good for

634
01:04:50,267 --> 01:04:51,700
and don't think
he doesn't know it

635
01:04:51,702 --> 01:04:53,535
so why don't you pay
your bill and leave

636
01:04:53,537 --> 01:04:55,571
before you cause
any more trouble!

637
01:04:55,573 --> 01:04:57,140
I have nothing to pay you with.

638
01:04:57,142 --> 01:04:58,575
Not half, you don't!

639
01:04:58,577 --> 01:05:02,682
More fool of my boy for thinking
he could get it out of you!

640
01:05:03,281 --> 01:05:04,714
Take this then.

641
01:05:04,716 --> 01:05:07,118
It's all that's left of us.

642
01:05:08,653 --> 01:05:10,189
Don't touch it!

643
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:24,403
She'll be back.

644
01:05:44,089 --> 01:05:45,220
Wait!

645
01:05:45,222 --> 01:05:46,224
Please.

646
01:05:48,225 --> 01:05:49,361
This is yours.

647
01:05:56,334 --> 01:05:58,069
She told you then?

648
01:05:59,771 --> 01:06:01,173
Told me what?

649
01:06:07,379 --> 01:06:08,381
Oh, Sean.

650
01:06:14,718 --> 01:06:18,421
In my dream, I saw
things, things I can't...

651
01:06:18,423 --> 01:06:20,823
Whatever that girl told you,

652
01:06:20,825 --> 01:06:22,694
whatever awful things,

653
01:06:23,662 --> 01:06:24,797
it's all true.

654
01:06:25,863 --> 01:06:27,564
Mam?

655
01:06:27,566 --> 01:06:31,468
How could people like us
ever help someone like her?

656
01:06:31,470 --> 01:06:33,502
It's not that I'm
not sorry for them.

657
01:06:33,504 --> 01:06:36,305
I've seen them when
I was at the house

658
01:06:36,307 --> 01:06:38,475
with the mending and washing.

659
01:06:38,477 --> 01:06:43,513
Just two little children too
young to know what they were.

660
01:06:43,515 --> 01:06:47,183
Do you believe that two
people can do something so,

661
01:06:47,185 --> 01:06:51,421
so unnatural that it
leaves a stain on them

662
01:06:51,423 --> 01:06:54,390
and that the stain goes
on to their children

663
01:06:54,392 --> 01:06:57,196
and to their
children's children?

664
01:07:01,665 --> 01:07:05,805
