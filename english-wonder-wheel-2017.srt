00:01:07,542 --> 00:01:11,142
<i>Coney Island, 1950s.</i>

3
00:01:11,144 --> 00:01:14,480
<i>The beach, the boardwalk.</i>

4
00:01:14,482 --> 00:01:17,817
<i>Once a luminous jewel, but
growing relentlessly seedier</i>

5
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:20,885
<i>as the tides roll in and out.</i>

6
00:01:20,887 --> 00:01:23,989
<i>Summers, I work here
on Bay Seven.</i>

7
00:01:23,991 --> 00:01:26,725
<i>Comes the fall, I'm a student
at New York University,</i>

8
00:01:26,727 --> 00:01:29,662
<i>going for my master's
in European Drama.</i>

9
00:01:29,664 --> 00:01:32,764
<i>I'm Mickey Ruben.
Poetic by nature.</i>

10
00:01:32,766 --> 00:01:34,966
<i>I harbor dreams
of being a writer,</i>

11
00:01:34,968 --> 00:01:37,269
<i>a writer of truly great plays,</i>

12
00:01:37,271 --> 00:01:40,072
<i>so I can one day
surprise everyone</i>

13
00:01:40,074 --> 00:01:43,442
<i>and turn out
a profound masterpiece.</i>

14
00:01:43,444 --> 00:01:44,609
<i>Anyhow...</i>

15
00:01:44,611 --> 00:01:46,144
...let me get to the story.

16
00:01:46,146 --> 00:01:48,379
In which I am a character,
so be warned,

17
00:01:48,381 --> 00:01:50,316
as a poet, I use symbols,

18
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:52,084
and as a budding dramatist,

19
00:01:52,086 --> 00:01:56,722
I relish melodrama
and larger-than-life characters.

20
00:01:56,724 --> 00:01:59,123
<i>Enter Carolina.</i>

21
00:02:16,677 --> 00:02:20,378
Okay, have fun.
Yep.

22
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,914
Excuse me.

23
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:24,783
Where's Humpty Jablon?
Does he work here?

24
00:02:24,785 --> 00:02:28,787
Uh, Humpty works the carousel,
but today he's working nights.

25
00:02:28,789 --> 00:02:30,755
Do you know
where he lives?

26
00:02:30,757 --> 00:02:33,626
Um, ah, it's around here.

27
00:02:33,628 --> 00:02:36,261
- You can ask Ginny.
- Ginny?

28
00:02:36,263 --> 00:02:37,862
Yeah, his... his wife.

29
00:02:37,864 --> 00:02:40,466
Um, she works
at Ruby's Clam House.

30
00:02:40,468 --> 00:02:43,902
Uh, you just keep
going down that way there.

31
00:02:43,904 --> 00:02:46,504
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah, you have a good one.

32
00:03:18,838 --> 00:03:23,077
- Hey, Charlie.
- Oh, hey.

33
00:03:24,545 --> 00:03:27,079
Excuse me.
Do you know if Ginny's here?

34
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:30,515
- Yeah, I'm Ginny.
- I'm Carolina.

35
00:03:30,517 --> 00:03:33,654
- Who?
- Carolina, Humpty's daughter.

36
00:03:38,892 --> 00:03:40,928
Jesus.

37
00:03:42,429 --> 00:03:44,229
Is he gonna be surprised.

38
00:03:44,231 --> 00:03:48,233
I know he's gonna be upset,
but I had to come here.

39
00:03:48,235 --> 00:03:51,636
I didn't want to,
but I don't have a choice.

40
00:03:53,908 --> 00:03:56,911
I'll tell you the truth.

41
00:03:57,844 --> 00:04:00,548
I don't think
he ever expected this.

42
00:04:01,415 --> 00:04:03,648
You're his wife?

43
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,185
Why are you looking at me?

44
00:04:06,187 --> 00:04:09,221
You're much younger
than I would have imagined.

45
00:04:09,223 --> 00:04:10,855
- Really?
- Mm.

46
00:04:10,857 --> 00:04:14,459
Oh, I don't feel
much younger.

47
00:04:14,461 --> 00:04:16,228
I was thinking
of my mother.

48
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,631
When she died,
she was practically...

49
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,598
...all gray.

50
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,334
I look like her.

51
00:04:22,336 --> 00:04:25,937
Humpty should be back
in half an hour.

52
00:04:25,939 --> 00:04:28,507
He went fishing off the pier
at Sheepshead Bay.

53
00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:31,209
I'd always heard that
he moved to New Jersey.

54
00:04:31,211 --> 00:04:34,146
No, we got thrown out
of our place there.

55
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:35,713
- Oh.
- Well, I'm not telling you

56
00:04:35,715 --> 00:04:38,149
anything new
about your father.

57
00:04:38,151 --> 00:04:42,086
He fell off the wagon
and busted up the lobby.

58
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:47,059
I guess you're used
to all this noise.

59
00:04:47,061 --> 00:04:48,994
You never
get used to it.

60
00:04:48,996 --> 00:04:53,168
I hate it.
This whole honkytonk fairyland.

61
00:04:54,367 --> 00:04:56,004
We live up here.

62
00:05:09,516 --> 00:05:10,783
Over here, folks!

63
00:05:10,785 --> 00:05:13,718
Place used to house
a freak show.

64
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,954
Humpty had to do
a lot of fixing up.

65
00:05:15,956 --> 00:05:18,523
Oh, God.
I hope when he sees me

66
00:05:18,525 --> 00:05:21,125
- he doesn't fly off the handle.
- No, I don't think it's...

67
00:05:21,127 --> 00:05:24,129
I hope he doesn't throw me out.
I-I don't know what I'll do.

68
00:05:24,131 --> 00:05:25,631
I don't have
a dime to my name.

69
00:05:25,633 --> 00:05:27,833
I literally
don't have ten pennies.

70
00:05:27,835 --> 00:05:30,134
Come on up
and play Skin the Wire.

71
00:05:30,136 --> 00:05:31,603
Hottest game on the boardwalk.

72
00:05:31,605 --> 00:05:34,139
This, this, this goddamn noise.

73
00:05:34,141 --> 00:05:37,009
I tell you.
You never get used to it.

74
00:05:37,011 --> 00:05:39,011
Ugh, my head's throbbing.

75
00:05:39,013 --> 00:05:42,581
And my, my kid, my kid had
some trouble in school today...

76
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:43,815
You and my father
have a child?

77
00:05:43,817 --> 00:05:45,550
No, from my first husband.

78
00:05:45,552 --> 00:05:47,086
Don't ever have kids.

79
00:05:47,088 --> 00:05:50,254
Now my head's cracking open.

80
00:05:50,256 --> 00:05:52,227
I get migraines.

81
00:05:53,093 --> 00:05:54,660
If you don't like Coney Island,

82
00:05:54,662 --> 00:05:57,032
why don't you move?

83
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,170
From your mouth to God's ears.

84
00:06:03,737 --> 00:06:05,670
Money, honey.

85
00:06:05,672 --> 00:06:08,709
Mazuma.
The wherewithal.

86
00:06:09,477 --> 00:06:12,778
Ginny!
Ginny, big score.

87
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:17,318
Fluke, flounder,
some, uh, blue claws.

88
00:06:22,555 --> 00:06:24,725
No.

89
00:06:25,925 --> 00:06:28,427
No. What the hell
you doin' here?

90
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:31,329
I told you never to step foot
in my home again.

91
00:06:31,331 --> 00:06:35,269
I'm in serious trouble.
I couldn't help it.

92
00:06:36,035 --> 00:06:37,706
You let her in here?

93
00:06:39,239 --> 00:06:40,908
Christ!

94
00:06:43,843 --> 00:06:46,081
I don't believe this.

95
00:06:48,749 --> 00:06:50,449
Can you just go?
Come on, go.

96
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,783
I can't.

97
00:06:51,785 --> 00:06:53,851
If they find me,
they're gonna kill me.

98
00:06:53,853 --> 00:06:55,887
You better hear her out, Humpty.

99
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:57,355
Mind your own business.

100
00:06:57,357 --> 00:06:59,690
I got a bad headache
and Richie did it again.

101
00:06:59,692 --> 00:07:00,925
You were supposed
to talk to him.

102
00:07:00,927 --> 00:07:02,593
I talked to him.

103
00:07:02,595 --> 00:07:04,829
Frank's gonna kill me.

104
00:07:04,831 --> 00:07:06,564
I ran away and I-I took nothing.

105
00:07:06,566 --> 00:07:10,435
I-I have no clothes,
I've been sleeping in the rain,

106
00:07:10,437 --> 00:07:13,639
and I'm marked.
They're gonna kill me.

107
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:16,307
Well, that's what you get
when you marry a gangster.

108
00:07:16,309 --> 00:07:18,644
Jesus, they're not gonna
come after you here, are they?

109
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:19,978
I don't like trouble.

110
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,680
Do you hear what I'm saying?

111
00:07:21,682 --> 00:07:24,449
- They're gonna kill me.
- There's a young kid here.

112
00:07:24,451 --> 00:07:26,617
- This is not our problem.
- All right, all right,

113
00:07:26,619 --> 00:07:28,590
all right, knock it off.

114
00:07:29,355 --> 00:07:32,124
- I-I gotta have a drink.
- No, Humpty, you've been good.

115
00:07:32,126 --> 00:07:34,927
I need one.

116
00:07:34,929 --> 00:07:36,761
I need one.
Look what's going on here.

117
00:07:36,763 --> 00:07:40,932
No booze.
I'll make you coffee.

118
00:07:40,934 --> 00:07:43,067
Goddamn it.

119
00:07:43,069 --> 00:07:44,569
What the hell
do you expect to happen

120
00:07:44,571 --> 00:07:46,370
when you marry
a cheap hoodlum?

121
00:07:46,372 --> 00:07:49,807
I was 20.
I didn't know better.

122
00:07:49,809 --> 00:07:51,175
I'm sorry.

123
00:07:51,177 --> 00:07:53,177
Why didn't you
go to the police?

124
00:07:53,179 --> 00:07:55,947
I told the police too much.
That's the problem.

125
00:07:55,949 --> 00:07:57,648
Why the hell
you open your mouth?

126
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,951
The police told me that
I could be looking at five years

127
00:07:59,953 --> 00:08:01,586
if I didn't cooperate.

128
00:08:01,588 --> 00:08:03,521
Well, what the hell do you know?

129
00:08:03,523 --> 00:08:06,490
Since when do you know
what happens inside the rackets?

130
00:08:06,492 --> 00:08:08,627
How could I not know?

131
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:10,329
You can't be married
to one of those guys

132
00:08:10,331 --> 00:08:12,266
and not pick up
on what's going on.

133
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:16,134
Jesus Christ!

134
00:08:16,136 --> 00:08:18,536
I told you not to marry
that racketeer!

135
00:08:18,538 --> 00:08:22,009
I told you he was all mobbed up!
He stank of murder!

136
00:08:23,042 --> 00:08:26,745
She found this,
this greaseball exciting!

137
00:08:26,747 --> 00:08:29,681
He wasn't even good lookin'!

138
00:08:29,683 --> 00:08:32,020
He was a punk!

139
00:08:34,154 --> 00:08:36,455
- I need a drink!
- Forget it, Humpty.

140
00:08:36,457 --> 00:08:39,523
I need one, goddamn it!

141
00:08:39,525 --> 00:08:41,692
Calm down.

142
00:08:50,838 --> 00:08:53,006
Jesus Christ.

143
00:08:53,973 --> 00:08:57,341
Goddamn it, she could have
married a few guys from school,

144
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,911
from the neighborhood.
All of 'em.

145
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,149
Decent kids.

146
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:04,115
We raised her nice.

147
00:09:04,117 --> 00:09:06,083
Your mother and I,

148
00:09:06,085 --> 00:09:09,922
we broke our backs off working
so you could go to college,

149
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:13,024
and, you know, you didn't.

150
00:09:13,026 --> 00:09:15,726
You threw it all away.

151
00:09:15,728 --> 00:09:18,163
Well, come on,
you're such a beautiful girl.

152
00:09:18,165 --> 00:09:20,532
You...

153
00:09:20,534 --> 00:09:21,866
You had your pick.

154
00:09:21,868 --> 00:09:24,903
I loved Frank, okay?

155
00:09:24,905 --> 00:09:26,370
And all the guys
you handpicked for me,

156
00:09:26,372 --> 00:09:29,774
they were dull, colorless,
boring guys.

157
00:09:29,776 --> 00:09:33,080
All of 'em honest men.
Every one of 'em.

158
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,885
Christ!

159
00:09:37,885 --> 00:09:40,588
Your mother's
last dying request...

160
00:09:41,588 --> 00:09:43,922
...on her deathbed

161
00:09:43,924 --> 00:09:48,162
was that you didn't run off
with that slime Frankie Adato.

162
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:52,431
You wouldn't give her that one
bit of satisfaction, would you?

163
00:09:52,433 --> 00:09:54,899
You wouldn't let her
die in peace.

164
00:09:54,901 --> 00:09:57,137
I loved him.

165
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:01,340
I was 20.
I-I wanted more.

166
00:10:01,342 --> 00:10:03,211
"More."

167
00:10:03,977 --> 00:10:05,509
More.
More what?

168
00:10:05,511 --> 00:10:08,346
Oh, Jesus, Humpty.
There's a world out there.

169
00:10:08,348 --> 00:10:10,548
This does not concern you.

170
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:13,351
All I know is,
you lost your head.

171
00:10:13,353 --> 00:10:15,687
Your head was in the clouds
over that gutter guinea,

172
00:10:15,689 --> 00:10:19,493
that flashy, cheap,
flashy little wop.

173
00:10:20,394 --> 00:10:24,096
You didn't think
I knew he carried a gun up here?

174
00:10:24,098 --> 00:10:25,831
- Huh?
- He'll know...

175
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,264
He'll know you came here.

176
00:10:27,266 --> 00:10:30,034
No, it's the last place
he'll look.

177
00:10:30,036 --> 00:10:32,336
He knows how you feel about me.

178
00:10:32,338 --> 00:10:33,938
Yeah.

179
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,606
You mean he knows

180
00:10:35,608 --> 00:10:38,713
how much you hated me
for calling it the way I saw it.

181
00:10:40,447 --> 00:10:42,183
Christ.

182
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:46,918
I counted on you when she died.

183
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,923
I was lost.

184
00:10:49,957 --> 00:10:51,722
You dumped me for that trash.

185
00:10:51,724 --> 00:10:54,861
That's why he wouldn't think
I'd come here.

186
00:10:55,695 --> 00:10:58,263
He knows that we haven't
exchanged words in five years,

187
00:10:58,265 --> 00:11:00,365
that the bad blood between us
ran too deep.

188
00:11:00,367 --> 00:11:02,400
If he shows up here,
I'll kill him.

189
00:11:02,402 --> 00:11:04,101
Oh, God,
don't say that.

190
00:11:04,103 --> 00:11:06,171
- I don't, I don't want trouble.
- All right.

191
00:11:06,173 --> 00:11:07,639
Okay, my nerves are shot
as it is...

192
00:11:07,641 --> 00:11:09,140
- Um...
- ...and you better calm down.

193
00:11:09,142 --> 00:11:11,375
All right.

194
00:11:11,377 --> 00:11:14,578
Just don't tell me
what I should or shouldn't do.

195
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,750
She's my daughter.

196
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:21,622
Christ.

197
00:11:23,424 --> 00:11:25,626
You were a light, baby.

198
00:11:27,361 --> 00:11:29,764
You were a light in my life.

199
00:11:31,165 --> 00:11:34,066
Do you know
how much I missed you?

200
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,069
Huh?

201
00:11:37,036 --> 00:11:39,574
Jesus!
Suddenly I'm starvin'.

202
00:11:40,641 --> 00:11:42,474
Clean the fish, Ginny.

203
00:11:42,476 --> 00:11:44,809
Yeah, yeah,
I'll make everybody stew.

204
00:11:44,811 --> 00:11:47,412
Yeah, you know,
eh, cooking relaxes my nerves.

205
00:11:47,414 --> 00:11:49,947
Clean the fish?
I got a headache.

206
00:11:49,949 --> 00:11:51,649
Clean the fish, Ginny,

207
00:11:51,651 --> 00:11:54,219
two or three at least,
and put paper down this time.

208
00:11:54,221 --> 00:11:57,025
Last time you got guts
all over the floor.

209
00:11:59,025 --> 00:12:02,259
Hey, you remember, Carolina?

210
00:12:02,261 --> 00:12:04,296
Remember I used to bake?

211
00:12:04,298 --> 00:12:06,230
I used to make you
those chocolate chip cookies?

212
00:12:06,232 --> 00:12:07,532
Mm.

213
00:12:07,534 --> 00:12:09,167
And I'd put
a little salt on it.

214
00:12:09,169 --> 00:12:11,369
You're late.

215
00:12:11,371 --> 00:12:13,471
And you're in real trouble.

216
00:12:13,473 --> 00:12:15,874
You know, you could
kill somebody starting fires.

217
00:12:15,876 --> 00:12:17,609
What kind of craziness is that?

218
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:20,245
Hey, listen to me.
You could hurt someone.

219
00:12:20,247 --> 00:12:23,315
Well, where'd you get
this idea to make fires?

220
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,684
Jesus, Humpty.
You sound so happy tonight.

221
00:12:26,686 --> 00:12:28,552
What happened?
Your number come in?

222
00:12:28,554 --> 00:12:30,054
Better than
my number came in.

223
00:12:30,056 --> 00:12:31,822
My ship came home.

224
00:12:31,824 --> 00:12:33,825
All right, well, have a good
night at the merry-go-round.

225
00:12:33,827 --> 00:12:35,092
All right, you too, man.

226
00:12:35,094 --> 00:12:36,628
- Smile!
- Oh, that's it.

227
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,230
- Hi, honey.
- Hold on there.

228
00:12:39,232 --> 00:12:40,999
Okay, son, smile.

229
00:12:46,973 --> 00:12:49,509
Oh!

230
00:12:50,444 --> 00:12:52,711
How long's she gonna stay here?

231
00:12:52,713 --> 00:12:55,547
I don't know.
Hey, maybe you can get her a job

232
00:12:55,549 --> 00:12:57,315
at that clam joint
you're working at.

233
00:12:57,317 --> 00:12:58,984
You think that's a good idea?

234
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,951
You said they were
looking for a second waitress.

235
00:13:00,953 --> 00:13:04,022
But they're after her.
Shouldn't she move on?

236
00:13:04,024 --> 00:13:06,291
Move where?

237
00:13:06,293 --> 00:13:07,893
I don't know,
maybe out of the country.

238
00:13:07,895 --> 00:13:09,727
Mexico?

239
00:13:09,729 --> 00:13:11,529
What, are you nuts?

240
00:13:11,531 --> 00:13:13,999
What the hell's
she gonna do in Mexico?

241
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,167
Ah, they're not
coming back here.

242
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,735
She's right.

243
00:13:16,737 --> 00:13:19,604
He knows how we feel
about each other.

244
00:13:19,606 --> 00:13:21,139
Well, we did.

245
00:13:21,141 --> 00:13:23,575
Different now.
Cloud's been lifted.

246
00:13:23,577 --> 00:13:25,576
I don't want guys comin' around
causing trouble.

247
00:13:25,578 --> 00:13:27,479
- There's a kid here.
- Ah, it's okay,

248
00:13:27,481 --> 00:13:29,514
as long as he doesn't
burn himself or kill somebody

249
00:13:29,516 --> 00:13:31,716
with those goddamn fires of his.

250
00:13:31,718 --> 00:13:33,817
He's a moody kid.

251
00:13:33,819 --> 00:13:36,053
He's got a moody mother.

252
00:13:36,055 --> 00:13:38,056
What's that supposed to mean?

253
00:13:38,058 --> 00:13:40,124
Jesus Christ,

254
00:13:40,126 --> 00:13:43,827
I can't believe Carolina's
gonna wind up a waitress.

255
00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:46,664
Thank God Shirley's
in her grave.

256
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:49,201
What about me
winding up a waitress?

257
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,036
It's not what I had
in mind either.

258
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,971
Hey...

259
00:13:52,973 --> 00:13:55,105
you wanna go fishin'
Friday night?

260
00:13:55,107 --> 00:13:57,875
The boys are bringing the wives.

261
00:13:57,877 --> 00:14:00,245
I don't go fishin', Humpty.

262
00:14:00,247 --> 00:14:01,879
How many times
we have to go over this?

263
00:14:01,881 --> 00:14:04,515
You, you don't like fishin',
you don't like boatin',

264
00:14:04,517 --> 00:14:06,951
you don't like, bowlin'.
What the hell do you like?

265
00:14:06,953 --> 00:14:09,821
You like the radio
and the movie stars, right?

266
00:14:09,823 --> 00:14:12,624
Readin' those goddamn
movie magazines all the time.

267
00:14:14,828 --> 00:14:16,894
I'm worried about Richie.

268
00:14:16,896 --> 00:14:20,097
Yeah, well, let me tell you
something about your son.

269
00:14:20,099 --> 00:14:22,067
He's gonna burn down somethin'.

270
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:28,273
There you are.

271
00:14:28,275 --> 00:14:30,609
Knew I'd find you here.

272
00:14:30,611 --> 00:14:32,943
- Why aren't you in school?
- I wanna see this picture.

273
00:14:32,945 --> 00:14:36,480
- It's the last day.
- You can't not go to school.

274
00:14:36,482 --> 00:14:38,984
Jesus, Richie, that's why
you're in summer school.

275
00:14:38,986 --> 00:14:41,485
'Cause you missed so many days.
They called again and asked,

276
00:14:41,487 --> 00:14:43,455
- "Is he sick?"
- I don't like school.

277
00:14:43,457 --> 00:14:45,356
It doesn't matter
if you don't like it.

278
00:14:45,358 --> 00:14:47,325
You know, I don't like
waiting on tables,

279
00:14:47,327 --> 00:14:48,793
but we need to eat
and pay the rent.

280
00:14:48,795 --> 00:14:50,794
Some things in life
you have to do

281
00:14:50,796 --> 00:14:53,298
- whether you like it or not.
- Let me watch the picture.

282
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,100
Where'd you get the money
for the movies anyhow?

283
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:58,036
I took 50 cents out of Humpty's
pants when he was asleep.

284
00:14:58,038 --> 00:14:59,770
What?
You steal from your father?

285
00:14:59,772 --> 00:15:01,538
He's not my father
and I hate him.

286
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,607
Don't you dare say that.

287
00:15:03,609 --> 00:15:05,644
You know, he saved my life.

288
00:15:05,646 --> 00:15:08,980
He's... you know, he's...
he's a good person.

289
00:15:08,982 --> 00:15:10,414
Then why does he hit you?

290
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:12,951
He doesn't hit me.
Hmm.

291
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,619
Yeah, when he gets drunk
he hits everybody,

292
00:15:14,621 --> 00:15:17,889
but he... he hardly drinks
anymore.

293
00:15:17,891 --> 00:15:19,557
Look, I can't sit here
arguing with you.

294
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:21,091
I have to go to work.

295
00:15:21,093 --> 00:15:22,826
Go to school, okay?

296
00:15:22,828 --> 00:15:26,498
If I catch you
playing with matches...

297
00:15:28,001 --> 00:15:30,335
Yes, it's a problem.

298
00:15:30,337 --> 00:15:32,403
Kid makes fires.

299
00:15:32,405 --> 00:15:34,205
And not such little ones.

300
00:15:42,348 --> 00:15:43,947
<i>He played hooky
from summer school</i>

301
00:15:43,949 --> 00:15:46,116
<i>and even made fires
on the beach</i>

302
00:15:46,118 --> 00:15:47,818
<i>where it's forbidden.</i>

303
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,889
<i>What the hell does the kid see</i>

304
00:15:50,891 --> 00:15:53,357
<i>when he just stares
into the flames.</i>

305
00:15:53,359 --> 00:15:56,427
<i>Is it the eternal power
of the universe?</i>

306
00:15:56,429 --> 00:15:59,197
<i>The conversion
of mass into energy?</i>

307
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,633
<i>The Furies at work?</i>

308
00:16:01,635 --> 00:16:04,101
<i>Whatever his motive,
it is not appreciated.</i>

309
00:16:06,405 --> 00:16:09,206
Hey!

310
00:16:16,382 --> 00:16:18,249
But what's the conditional?

311
00:16:18,251 --> 00:16:19,717
Oh...

312
00:16:19,719 --> 00:16:22,354
Jesus, Richie,
I c... I can't remember.

313
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,389
I went to school years ago.

314
00:16:24,391 --> 00:16:27,091
God, if you,
if you'd pay attention in class.

315
00:16:27,093 --> 00:16:29,193
You hated school.

316
00:16:29,195 --> 00:16:30,495
What?
No, I didn't.

317
00:16:30,497 --> 00:16:32,964
I liked it.
I liked school.

318
00:16:32,966 --> 00:16:35,399
But I had to quit.
We were poor.

319
00:16:35,401 --> 00:16:37,101
You know, I had to work.

320
00:16:37,103 --> 00:16:39,070
I was lucky.
I was lucky.

321
00:16:39,072 --> 00:16:40,839
I-I had some talent.

322
00:16:40,841 --> 00:16:43,475
You know, I-I was a...
I was a...

323
00:16:43,477 --> 00:16:45,909
I was a very promising
young actress.

324
00:16:45,911 --> 00:16:47,644
Oh, God.

325
00:16:47,646 --> 00:16:49,748
Oh, God, if you coulda seen me
in some of those shows.

326
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,482
Let me show you
a couple of pieces,

327
00:16:51,484 --> 00:16:52,884
- but this is, this...
- Again?

328
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,952
...this is from <i>Dulcy,</i> okay?

329
00:16:54,954 --> 00:16:56,788
You know, I know
I showed you these pieces,

330
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,623
but I never know
if you're paying any attention.

331
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,057
I wore this in <i>Dulcy.</i>
Look at that.

332
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:01,726
Though it's not real,
but, you know.

333
00:17:01,728 --> 00:17:03,928
- I've seen it.
- Isn't it beautiful?

334
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,829
God, look at that.
It's...

335
00:17:05,831 --> 00:17:07,499
Let me show you this, uh...

336
00:17:07,501 --> 00:17:08,799
Wait, did I show you the,

337
00:17:08,801 --> 00:17:10,434
uh, the piece from the musical?

338
00:17:10,436 --> 00:17:12,170
- Yes.
- From <i>Oh, Kay</i>?

339
00:17:12,172 --> 00:17:14,972
I don't know if I did.
I had an incredible voice.

340
00:17:14,974 --> 00:17:17,107
You know, I almost got
the lead in that show,

341
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:19,144
and the, the girl
who got the part...

342
00:17:19,146 --> 00:17:21,145
She was fat.

343
00:17:21,147 --> 00:17:23,448
And I had a much better voice
than her.

344
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,349
Is that where you met Dad?

345
00:17:25,351 --> 00:17:27,384
Yeah.

346
00:17:27,386 --> 00:17:31,423
Yeah, yeah, your real father
was a drummer.

347
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,290
He played jazz music.

348
00:17:33,292 --> 00:17:35,527
God, he had perfect rhythm.

349
00:17:35,529 --> 00:17:38,762
Ah, it was quite amazing.

350
00:17:38,764 --> 00:17:41,598
And he also had black hair
and he had...

351
00:17:43,002 --> 00:17:45,303
...he had green eyes.

352
00:17:45,305 --> 00:17:48,239
Where is my father?

353
00:17:48,241 --> 00:17:49,606
My real father?

354
00:17:49,608 --> 00:17:51,843
I told you many times.

355
00:17:51,845 --> 00:17:54,548
Gone.

356
00:17:55,514 --> 00:17:57,882
A rainy day at the beach.

357
00:17:57,884 --> 00:17:59,584
Time off for me.

358
00:17:59,586 --> 00:18:02,186
Nobody swims
during a lightning storm.

359
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:07,692
I guess this is as good a time
as any to tell you,

360
00:18:07,694 --> 00:18:11,628
I'm having an affair with Ginny,
Humpty's wife.

361
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:13,798
Let me fill you in on that.

362
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,067
It started at the beginning
of the summer.

363
00:18:16,069 --> 00:18:19,604
At that point I didn't know
either Humpty or Ginny.

364
00:18:57,277 --> 00:18:59,877
<i>And then,
at the end of a cloudy day,</i>

365
00:18:59,879 --> 00:19:02,713
<i>it started to rain,
and the last few stragglers</i>

366
00:19:02,715 --> 00:19:04,848
<i>were packing up
and leaving the beach.</i>

367
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:07,218
<i>And suddenly this
kind of interesting woman</i>

368
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,487
<i>comes walking along
the water's edge,</i>

369
00:19:09,489 --> 00:19:11,021
<i>and the dramatist in me sensed</i>

370
00:19:11,023 --> 00:19:12,891
<i>she was in
some kind of trouble</i>

371
00:19:12,893 --> 00:19:15,393
<i>because her body language
read vulnerable</i>

372
00:19:15,395 --> 00:19:17,628
<i>and desperate.</i>

373
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,797
Miss.

374
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:21,798
You can't be out here
right now.

375
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,070
Everybody has to go in.

376
00:19:25,472 --> 00:19:27,905
We're expecting
lightning storms.

377
00:19:27,907 --> 00:19:29,574
- What?
- We gotta,

378
00:19:29,576 --> 00:19:32,676
we gotta go in.
We gotta clear the beach.

379
00:19:32,678 --> 00:19:36,681
- Really?
- Yeah, we gotta go in.

380
00:19:38,585 --> 00:19:41,752
Yeah, I-I been
all over the world.

381
00:19:41,754 --> 00:19:44,021
I went to NYU and...

382
00:19:44,023 --> 00:19:47,659
...right when I started,
boom, the Japs hit Pearl Harbor.

383
00:19:47,661 --> 00:19:50,694
So after I got out,
I went back to school,

384
00:19:50,696 --> 00:19:52,931
and now I'm working
to get my master's.

385
00:19:52,933 --> 00:19:55,567
But I-I don't resent
my years in the Navy.

386
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,701
I mean, I really saw the world.

387
00:19:57,703 --> 00:19:59,103
You ever travel?

388
00:19:59,105 --> 00:20:00,704
Not really.

389
00:20:00,706 --> 00:20:02,574
No place magical.

390
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:05,209
You wanna know the best place
I ever saw?

391
00:20:05,211 --> 00:20:06,877
Where's that?

392
00:20:06,879 --> 00:20:08,512
Bora Bora.

393
00:20:08,514 --> 00:20:10,080
I heard of it.

394
00:20:10,082 --> 00:20:13,785
It's over by Tahiti
where Gauguin ran away to paint.

395
00:20:13,787 --> 00:20:15,819
The water there...

396
00:20:15,821 --> 00:20:18,722
...is so clear and unspoiled.

397
00:20:18,724 --> 00:20:22,292
You can look down and see
all the bright colored fish,

398
00:20:22,294 --> 00:20:24,729
bright red and yellow fish.

399
00:20:24,731 --> 00:20:26,998
And, and the flowers
are amazing.

400
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,266
And at night,

401
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:30,867
you never saw stars like that
on this planet.

402
00:20:30,869 --> 00:20:34,771
You can actually read
by starlight.

403
00:20:34,773 --> 00:20:36,910
What're you gonna write?

404
00:20:37,844 --> 00:20:39,344
Plays about human life.

405
00:20:39,346 --> 00:20:41,045
Great tragic plays

406
00:20:41,047 --> 00:20:43,314
where the protagonist
gets crushed

407
00:20:43,316 --> 00:20:45,415
because of some fatal weakness.

408
00:20:45,417 --> 00:20:47,554
Like what?

409
00:20:49,755 --> 00:20:51,455
My tragic flaw is

410
00:20:51,457 --> 00:20:54,325
I'm too romantic a character.

411
00:20:54,327 --> 00:20:57,694
You ever hear that song,
"I Fall in Love Too Easily"?

412
00:20:57,696 --> 00:21:00,198
You always...

413
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,367
...think a person's tragedy
is their own fault?

414
00:21:03,369 --> 00:21:04,769
No.

415
00:21:04,771 --> 00:21:06,136
Fate plays a big role.

416
00:21:06,138 --> 00:21:08,839
More stuff in life
is out of our control

417
00:21:08,841 --> 00:21:10,877
than we'd like to admit.

418
00:21:11,543 --> 00:21:13,746
Except...

419
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,783
I brought my troubles on myself.

420
00:21:18,117 --> 00:21:19,483
Yeah.

421
00:21:19,485 --> 00:21:21,786
I guessed that when I saw you.

422
00:21:21,788 --> 00:21:23,721
I thought,
"She's very pretty,

423
00:21:23,723 --> 00:21:26,225
but somewhere
there's a tragic flaw."

424
00:21:28,828 --> 00:21:31,898
Yeah, I made a mistake.

425
00:21:32,765 --> 00:21:35,101
But that was years ago.

426
00:21:36,001 --> 00:21:39,403
I'll never make that
mistake again.

427
00:21:39,405 --> 00:21:41,341
Yes?

428
00:21:42,776 --> 00:21:45,143
I have to go.

429
00:21:45,145 --> 00:21:46,844
Hey...

430
00:21:46,846 --> 00:21:49,883
...you think you'll make it down
to the beach again soon?

431
00:21:51,317 --> 00:21:53,951
Yeah, I might.

432
00:21:53,953 --> 00:21:55,888
I might.

433
00:21:58,957 --> 00:22:01,294
Where'd you go today?
Came home late.

434
00:22:01,994 --> 00:22:04,263
Took a walk
on the beach.

435
00:22:05,598 --> 00:22:07,565
That's unlike you.

436
00:22:07,567 --> 00:22:09,267
I was in a funny mood.

437
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:15,573
Hey, you wanna go
to Yankee Stadium Sunday?

438
00:22:15,575 --> 00:22:17,442
It's the Red Sox.

439
00:22:17,444 --> 00:22:19,076
It's not me, Humpty.

440
00:22:19,078 --> 00:22:21,412
For the millionth time,
I don't care about baseball.

441
00:22:21,414 --> 00:22:23,013
But you used to go.

442
00:22:23,015 --> 00:22:24,682
Well, I tried to get interested
for your sake.

443
00:22:24,684 --> 00:22:26,854
I couldn't do it.

444
00:22:29,422 --> 00:22:31,689
You wanna go?
I got an extra ticket.

445
00:22:31,691 --> 00:22:34,325
I wanna go to the movies.

446
00:22:34,327 --> 00:22:35,926
You know what?

447
00:22:35,928 --> 00:22:39,596
You're gonna hurt your eyes
in so many movies.

448
00:22:39,598 --> 00:22:40,998
Your just like your mother.

449
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,934
She listens to that crap
on the radio,

450
00:22:43,936 --> 00:22:46,305
she thinks it's real.

451
00:22:47,807 --> 00:22:50,508
I wanna be honest with you,
Mickey.

452
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:52,011
I'm married.

453
00:22:53,445 --> 00:22:55,179
I'm a married woman.

454
00:22:55,181 --> 00:22:58,117
I wanna be honest with you,
Mickey.

455
00:22:59,853 --> 00:23:02,586
I'm a married woman.

456
00:23:02,588 --> 00:23:05,759
I'm married, Mickey.

457
00:23:06,893 --> 00:23:08,893
I felt strange mentioning it.

458
00:23:08,895 --> 00:23:12,163
Not that you asked.

459
00:23:12,165 --> 00:23:14,531
I got myself
into a bad situation.

460
00:23:14,533 --> 00:23:17,970
I got myself... I got myself
into a bad situation.

461
00:23:19,705 --> 00:23:22,105
You're right.
I had...

462
00:23:22,107 --> 00:23:24,875
I had notions
about ending everything.

463
00:23:24,877 --> 00:23:27,747
Thought about drowning.

464
00:23:29,315 --> 00:23:33,617
Of course, with a kid,
that's not an option.

465
00:23:33,619 --> 00:23:35,385
Besides...

466
00:23:35,387 --> 00:23:38,556
...you'd have dived in
and ruined my dramatic finale.

467
00:23:42,761 --> 00:23:45,328
I feel trapped.
I feel trapped.

468
00:23:48,568 --> 00:23:50,500
<i>Ginny did come back
to the beach.</i>

469
00:23:50,502 --> 00:23:52,903
<i>And she looked sexy.</i>

470
00:23:52,905 --> 00:23:54,105
<i>And I knew a spot</i>

471
00:23:54,107 --> 00:23:56,140
<i>on the far end of the boardwalk.</i>

472
00:24:14,694 --> 00:24:17,528
I have something
to tell you.

473
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:20,501
Two things to tell.

474
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,435
Nothing you could tell me

475
00:24:25,437 --> 00:24:28,407
could put the slightest shadow
on this evening.

476
00:24:29,576 --> 00:24:32,112
I'm not 35.

477
00:24:33,445 --> 00:24:35,182
I'm 38.

478
00:24:36,515 --> 00:24:39,485
I'm 39.

479
00:24:40,386 --> 00:24:43,820
Ah, that's a very hot age
for a woman.

480
00:24:43,822 --> 00:24:45,890
I'm a very lucky guy.

481
00:24:45,892 --> 00:24:48,929
I'm old... older than you.

482
00:24:49,695 --> 00:24:51,330
What's the second thing?

483
00:24:52,464 --> 00:24:54,731
I'm married.

484
00:24:54,733 --> 00:24:56,499
You are?

485
00:24:56,501 --> 00:24:58,469
I have a husband

486
00:24:58,471 --> 00:25:01,071
and a child
from my first marriage.

487
00:25:01,073 --> 00:25:02,940
You thought, uh...

488
00:25:02,942 --> 00:25:05,479
you thought it would
spoil everything, right?

489
00:25:06,846 --> 00:25:08,816
Has it?

490
00:25:10,349 --> 00:25:14,518
It's not the first time I've
found a married woman beautiful.

491
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,587
I ruined my life by...

492
00:25:17,589 --> 00:25:22,692
by being unfaithful once,
and now I'm doing it again.

493
00:25:22,694 --> 00:25:24,428
You brought about
your own downfall

494
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:26,463
by being unfaithful?

495
00:25:30,103 --> 00:25:32,406
It was someone I loved.

496
00:25:35,274 --> 00:25:37,176
A drummer.

497
00:25:38,243 --> 00:25:41,214
Whose rhythm pulsated with life.

498
00:25:42,482 --> 00:25:45,849
And we married and had a child,
and...

499
00:25:45,851 --> 00:25:47,751
...he adored me.

500
00:25:47,753 --> 00:25:49,819
And yet...

501
00:25:49,821 --> 00:25:51,588
Oh, and yet I c...

502
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:54,090
...couldn't resist the beautiful
young man in the cast

503
00:25:54,092 --> 00:25:56,961
who played Marchbanks.

504
00:25:56,963 --> 00:25:58,528
God, he wasn't even
the leading man,

505
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:01,065
but he, but he kissed me onstage
every night

506
00:26:01,067 --> 00:26:03,467
and I started looking forward
to those kisses,

507
00:26:03,469 --> 00:26:05,269
and... and, um...

508
00:26:05,271 --> 00:26:08,873
I wound up in his bed,
and...

509
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:13,044
and then my husband found out
and...

510
00:26:13,046 --> 00:26:15,349
and it crushed him.

511
00:26:17,183 --> 00:26:20,420
Oh, he deserved
so much better than me.

512
00:26:22,187 --> 00:26:25,124
I-I broke his heart.

513
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:29,463
Humiliated, he ran away.

514
00:26:31,463 --> 00:26:34,999
I didn't blame him for going
as far from me as he could,

515
00:26:35,001 --> 00:26:37,768
and when he left...

516
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:42,041
I learned for the first time
what love was.

517
00:26:43,943 --> 00:26:47,010
But I was too late

518
00:26:47,012 --> 00:26:49,180
because he was gone.

519
00:26:49,182 --> 00:26:52,219
And I started coming apart.

520
00:26:53,286 --> 00:26:55,219
Oh, I-I couldn't act anymore.

521
00:26:55,221 --> 00:26:56,753
I couldn't keep my mind
on my role.

522
00:26:56,755 --> 00:26:58,154
I...

523
00:26:58,156 --> 00:27:00,657
I-I'd forget my lines,

524
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:02,993
miss my cues,

525
00:27:02,995 --> 00:27:04,729
and I drank,

526
00:27:04,731 --> 00:27:08,665
and I lost work.

527
00:27:08,667 --> 00:27:10,534
And Harold...

528
00:27:10,536 --> 00:27:14,571
...Humpty,
who was also a lost soul,

529
00:27:14,573 --> 00:27:18,241
met me at a diner and thought
I was the prettiest thing,

530
00:27:18,243 --> 00:27:20,744
the belle of the ball, and...

531
00:27:20,746 --> 00:27:23,346
...and we helped one another
scramble back onto our feet,

532
00:27:23,348 --> 00:27:25,048
and it's been five years,
and...

533
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:27,486
...and I owe him a lot.

534
00:27:28,488 --> 00:27:30,587
But just as I learned
from my first husband

535
00:27:30,589 --> 00:27:32,522
what love was...

536
00:27:32,524 --> 00:27:36,729
...I... I learned from Humpty
what it was not.

537
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:40,964
It's not gratitude.
It's not company.

538
00:27:40,966 --> 00:27:43,433
And it's not going through
the motions of lovemaking

539
00:27:43,435 --> 00:27:46,703
when... you have so much to give.

540
00:27:46,705 --> 00:27:50,444
And no one
you really wanna give it to.

541
00:28:03,655 --> 00:28:06,490
<i>And so it was
a pretty intense summer,</i>

542
00:28:06,492 --> 00:28:08,491
<i>and not just the humidity.</i>

543
00:28:08,493 --> 00:28:10,126
<i>I was involved
in a relationship</i>

544
00:28:10,128 --> 00:28:12,163
<i>with an older, ex-actress,</i>

545
00:28:12,165 --> 00:28:14,798
<i>unhappily married,
and love starved.</i>

546
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,101
<i>She made up
one lie after another</i>

547
00:28:17,103 --> 00:28:19,769
<i>to filch time to see me.</i>

548
00:28:33,685 --> 00:28:35,286
I've never been
to Greenwich Village.

549
00:28:35,288 --> 00:28:36,953
It's got a lot of meaning
for me.

550
00:28:36,955 --> 00:28:39,856
All the artists and writers
I love hung out here,

551
00:28:39,858 --> 00:28:41,724
and it's close to school.

552
00:28:43,396 --> 00:28:46,063
All right.
Remember...

553
00:28:46,065 --> 00:28:48,731
...it's nothing
but a rented hovel.

554
00:28:52,472 --> 00:28:54,872
Wow.

555
00:28:54,874 --> 00:28:56,673
Ah, it's cozy.

556
00:28:56,675 --> 00:28:58,008
That's very tactful.

557
00:29:05,984 --> 00:29:08,384
These beautiful gardens.

558
00:29:08,386 --> 00:29:11,058
How do you find these places?

559
00:29:13,225 --> 00:29:15,259
My fantasy is that...

560
00:29:15,261 --> 00:29:17,060
is that you write a play

561
00:29:17,062 --> 00:29:19,430
with a character in
it I could play.

562
00:29:19,432 --> 00:29:22,365
"Making her triumphant return
to the stage,

563
00:29:22,367 --> 00:29:24,701
Miss Virginia..."
- Virginia DeLorean.

564
00:29:24,703 --> 00:29:27,538
Virginia DeLorean.
Not Ginny Jablon.

565
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,405
- Wow.
- "In tonight's performance,

566
00:29:29,407 --> 00:29:33,676
the part of Juliet will be
played by Virginia DeLorean."

567
00:29:33,678 --> 00:29:36,346
I love it.
That was your maiden name?

568
00:29:36,348 --> 00:29:37,815
My real name was Westlake,

569
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:41,484
but, but I took DeLorean
as a, as a stage name.

570
00:29:41,486 --> 00:29:44,121
- Hmm.
- God, all that summer stock

571
00:29:44,123 --> 00:29:46,824
and hard work so I could afford
acting lessons

572
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:48,192
just so I could...

573
00:29:48,194 --> 00:29:49,993
just so I could wind up
playing the part

574
00:29:49,995 --> 00:29:54,064
of a waitress
in a clam house.

575
00:29:54,066 --> 00:29:55,833
I am playing a part.

576
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:57,401
You know, it's not me.

577
00:29:57,403 --> 00:29:59,068
It's not me.
You think, you think it's me?

578
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,538
- No, I...
- Oh, God.

579
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:04,340
I-I mean, I act it every day,
but I'm acting.

580
00:30:04,342 --> 00:30:06,743
I'm not a waitress
in a clam house.

581
00:30:06,745 --> 00:30:08,945
- There's more to me than that.
- I...

582
00:30:08,947 --> 00:30:10,247
I mean, I'm just playing

583
00:30:10,249 --> 00:30:12,249
the thankless role
of the waitress.

584
00:30:12,251 --> 00:30:13,616
Hey, hey.

585
00:30:13,618 --> 00:30:16,019
- Ginny, wh...
- I'm sorry.

586
00:30:16,021 --> 00:30:18,923
I'm unraveling.

587
00:30:18,925 --> 00:30:20,657
Promise me we'll come back here.

588
00:30:25,598 --> 00:30:27,263
<i>She had less trouble
slipping away</i>

589
00:30:27,265 --> 00:30:28,932
<i>after Humpty's daughter
showed up</i>

590
00:30:28,934 --> 00:30:32,672
<i>because he was so happy
to see Carolina back.</i>

591
00:30:33,772 --> 00:30:36,173
Guess which number
came in today?

592
00:30:36,175 --> 00:30:38,576
Oh, which?

593
00:30:38,578 --> 00:30:40,978
Mine.

594
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:43,012
300 bucks.

595
00:30:43,014 --> 00:30:44,448
This is for your night school.

596
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:45,816
Good because
I have one picked out.

597
00:30:45,818 --> 00:30:47,351
Good 'cause
I don't want you waitressing

598
00:30:47,353 --> 00:30:49,686
all your goddamn life.

599
00:31:30,296 --> 00:31:32,563
Hey, You Humpty?

600
00:31:32,565 --> 00:31:35,633
- Yeah.
- Frank Adato says hello.

601
00:31:35,635 --> 00:31:38,368
He's very upset because
his wife's gone missing,

602
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:40,873
and we're trying to find her.

603
00:31:42,174 --> 00:31:43,574
Ah.

604
00:31:43,576 --> 00:31:46,477
Since, uh,
she's your daughter,

605
00:31:46,479 --> 00:31:48,746
we thought we'd
check with you.

606
00:31:48,748 --> 00:31:52,986
Well, I haven't seen Carolina
in years.

607
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,553
We're not on good terms.

608
00:31:56,555 --> 00:31:59,256
Frank must have told you that.

609
00:31:59,258 --> 00:32:02,358
I haven't spoken to her
in five years.

610
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,162
I don't know.
I lost track of her

611
00:32:05,164 --> 00:32:06,997
after she ran off
and got married.

612
00:32:06,999 --> 00:32:08,699
- Uh-huh, really?
- Yeah.

613
00:32:08,701 --> 00:32:10,534
Do me a favor.
I'm talking to you.

614
00:32:10,536 --> 00:32:13,306
Stop working, all right?

615
00:32:16,175 --> 00:32:18,642
You try California?

616
00:32:18,644 --> 00:32:23,047
She always talked about living
in San Francisco or Los Angeles.

617
00:32:23,049 --> 00:32:26,416
I don't know.
I wouldn't even recognize her.

618
00:32:26,418 --> 00:32:28,484
We just thought maybe
she'd turn up here.

619
00:32:28,486 --> 00:32:30,921
Yeah, well,
she wouldn't find me.

620
00:32:30,923 --> 00:32:34,892
I moved three or four times
in five years.

621
00:32:34,894 --> 00:32:36,660
I mean, how the hell'd
you find me?

622
00:32:36,662 --> 00:32:39,529
Frank's very worried about her.

623
00:32:39,531 --> 00:32:44,034
Well, she'll never turn up here,

624
00:32:44,036 --> 00:32:45,702
and if she does,

625
00:32:45,704 --> 00:32:47,904
I'll tell her Frank's
looking for her, all right?

626
00:32:47,906 --> 00:32:49,506
Hey, Humpty.

627
00:32:49,508 --> 00:32:51,374
Did you hit him again?

628
00:32:51,376 --> 00:32:53,176
I told you.

629
00:32:53,178 --> 00:32:56,680
I told you next time I catch him
taking money out of my pocket...

630
00:32:56,682 --> 00:32:59,583
And I told you
not to hit him.

631
00:32:59,585 --> 00:33:02,219
All right.
We'll talk about it later.

632
00:33:02,221 --> 00:33:04,488
I'm talking
to these gentlemen here.

633
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:05,989
Go home.
We'll discuss it later.

634
00:33:05,991 --> 00:33:08,092
How do you do?

635
00:33:08,094 --> 00:33:10,193
This is my wife.

636
00:33:10,195 --> 00:33:12,395
Stepson.
Go on, go on home.

637
00:33:12,397 --> 00:33:14,030
We're looking
for Carolina Adato.

638
00:33:14,032 --> 00:33:17,067
- I told 'em.
- Humpty's daughter.

639
00:33:17,069 --> 00:33:18,701
I told 'em.

640
00:33:18,703 --> 00:33:21,070
I haven't seen her
in five years.

641
00:33:21,072 --> 00:33:22,772
Yeah, yeah, he disowned her.

642
00:33:22,774 --> 00:33:24,340
She'd never show her face
around her.

643
00:33:24,342 --> 00:33:25,776
Let's go.

644
00:33:25,778 --> 00:33:27,577
Is that a gun?

645
00:33:27,579 --> 00:33:30,146
Sharp kid.
They're very dangerous.

646
00:33:30,148 --> 00:33:32,915
You people would never
try to hide her, would you?

647
00:33:32,917 --> 00:33:35,318
Hide her for what?
What'd she do?

648
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,887
You know,
you're a nice family.

649
00:33:37,889 --> 00:33:40,958
I wouldn't like to see you
get into trouble.

650
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,393
Can I see the gun?

651
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:45,662
No, you can't.
Let's go, Richie.

652
00:33:45,664 --> 00:33:48,100
See you later, Humpty.

653
00:33:50,136 --> 00:33:53,039
Hey, what can I tell you?

654
00:33:56,908 --> 00:33:58,474
She's not here.

655
00:33:58,476 --> 00:34:00,676
Frank says there's bad blood
between 'em.

656
00:34:00,678 --> 00:34:02,745
Maybe California's
a better idea,

657
00:34:02,747 --> 00:34:04,814
and I'm startin' to think
we ain't gonna find her.

658
00:34:04,816 --> 00:34:07,419
No.
I'm gonna find her.

659
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,720
Wanna get some oysters?

660
00:34:09,722 --> 00:34:11,488
They probably got great oysters
in here.

661
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:13,424
Oh, I love oysters.

662
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:16,759
Eh, but do we got time?
Vinnie.

663
00:34:16,761 --> 00:34:19,430
Christ, 5:00
we gotta meet him in Hoboken?

664
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:21,098
You know the way he gets
when we're late.

665
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,433
Come on.

666
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:24,700
God.
I coulda went for oysters.

667
00:34:24,702 --> 00:34:28,404
Hey, John,
I need two beers.

668
00:34:28,406 --> 00:34:30,040
Hey, what's your name?

669
00:34:30,042 --> 00:34:31,274
Why?

670
00:34:31,276 --> 00:34:32,676
What time do you get off?

671
00:34:32,678 --> 00:34:34,444
I don't get off.
I go right to school.

672
00:34:34,446 --> 00:34:36,013
Oh.
Night school?

673
00:34:36,015 --> 00:34:38,582
- That's right.
- What are you studying?

674
00:34:38,584 --> 00:34:40,283
To be an English teacher.

675
00:34:40,285 --> 00:34:42,386
- Here you go, two beers.
- What time is class over?

676
00:34:42,388 --> 00:34:45,022
- I got a lot of homework.
- Aw, I'm strikin' out here.

677
00:34:45,024 --> 00:34:46,857
When do you graduate?

678
00:34:46,859 --> 00:34:49,826
<i>And so the angel
of death passed over them</i>

679
00:34:49,828 --> 00:34:51,727
<i>and headed out west,</i>

680
00:34:51,729 --> 00:34:53,863
<i>but his shadow was scary.</i>

681
00:34:53,865 --> 00:34:57,433
<i>It took a few days
of summer sun to decompress.</i>

682
00:34:57,435 --> 00:34:59,736
<i>Life on the boardwalk
provided the tourists</i>

683
00:34:59,738 --> 00:35:02,506
<i>with cheap thrills
and great hot dogs.</i>

684
00:35:02,508 --> 00:35:04,674
<i>When she wasn't
breaking dishes</i>

685
00:35:04,676 --> 00:35:06,176
<i>or customer's hearts,</i>

686
00:35:06,178 --> 00:35:08,111
<i>Carolina took
a limited program</i>

687
00:35:08,113 --> 00:35:09,812
<i>at night school.</i>

688
00:35:09,814 --> 00:35:12,316
<i>And when Humpty
wasn't trying to get riders</i>

689
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:14,817
<i>for those empty horses
on the carousel,</i>

690
00:35:14,819 --> 00:35:17,020
<i>he was off chasing
fluke and flounder.</i>

691
00:35:17,022 --> 00:35:19,156
Your wife don't like to go
fishing anymore, Humpty.

692
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:20,924
Ah.

693
00:35:20,926 --> 00:35:23,993
She never really liked it.
She made like she liked it...

694
00:35:23,995 --> 00:35:26,529
...to get me on the hook.

695
00:35:26,531 --> 00:35:28,700
I was the fish.

696
00:35:35,908 --> 00:35:37,508
Careful, careful.

697
00:35:45,651 --> 00:35:47,551
I used to hate the rain.

698
00:35:47,553 --> 00:35:48,951
Now I love it

699
00:35:48,953 --> 00:35:50,620
'cause it means
you get time off.

700
00:35:50,622 --> 00:35:52,421
Oh, one of the perks
of being a lifeguard.

701
00:35:52,423 --> 00:35:54,524
Yeah, now I see rain
through your eyes,

702
00:35:54,526 --> 00:35:57,060
and it's beautiful.

703
00:35:58,897 --> 00:36:01,832
You know, you'd go crazy
over Bora Bora.

704
00:36:01,834 --> 00:36:04,167
The sunsets, the sunrises.

705
00:36:04,169 --> 00:36:05,769
Paradise.

706
00:36:05,771 --> 00:36:08,437
I'd go off with you
any place you asked me to.

707
00:36:10,475 --> 00:36:13,477
You say your miserable
at home with Humpty.

708
00:36:13,479 --> 00:36:15,412
W-w-why do you stay
with the guy?

709
00:36:15,414 --> 00:36:18,982
Oh.
Me and Richie?

710
00:36:18,984 --> 00:36:20,783
What a joke.

711
00:36:20,785 --> 00:36:22,319
Waiting on tables,

712
00:36:22,321 --> 00:36:24,154
trying to suck
nickel and dime tips

713
00:36:24,156 --> 00:36:26,189
out of redneck clowns
wearing lobster bibs?

714
00:36:26,191 --> 00:36:28,524
Yeah, I know.
It is pretty sleazy

715
00:36:28,526 --> 00:36:29,859
what's happened
to Coney Island.

716
00:36:29,861 --> 00:36:31,828
Hey, I don't wanna spoil
the rainy day.

717
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:34,298
Tell me about
the Chekhov play you read.

718
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,799
No, you tell me.

719
00:36:35,801 --> 00:36:38,067
You ever play Chekhov?

720
00:36:38,069 --> 00:36:39,468
I can't remember.

721
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:41,337
Maybe once in Baltimore.

722
00:36:41,339 --> 00:36:43,473
When an actress got sick.

723
00:36:53,151 --> 00:36:55,685
How's it coming?

724
00:36:55,687 --> 00:36:59,055
Well...
I know he has feelings for me.

725
00:36:59,057 --> 00:37:01,857
I-I know it's not
just a summer thing.

726
00:37:01,859 --> 00:37:04,560
Oh, God, I hope
I'm not misreading it all.

727
00:37:04,562 --> 00:37:07,163
I try to,
I try to push him

728
00:37:07,165 --> 00:37:10,232
without being
one of those pushy women.

729
00:37:10,234 --> 00:37:13,102
You know, I don... don't want
my desperation to show.

730
00:37:13,104 --> 00:37:17,506
Well, there's progress,
but, but it's slow.

731
00:37:17,508 --> 00:37:19,542
You know?

732
00:37:19,544 --> 00:37:22,078
God, if the summer ends
and it fizzles out

733
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,680
and I'm left at square one,
I don't know what I'll do.

734
00:37:24,682 --> 00:37:26,716
Well, you'll survive
like we all do.

735
00:37:26,718 --> 00:37:29,185
No, no, I'm not
a strong person.

736
00:37:29,187 --> 00:37:31,020
I wouldn't have survived
my breakdown

737
00:37:31,022 --> 00:37:33,022
if it wasn't for Humpty.
Now I'm feeling claustrophobic,

738
00:37:33,024 --> 00:37:35,892
- the headaches are back...
- You just have to be realistic.

739
00:37:35,894 --> 00:37:38,261
In case things
don't go your way.

740
00:37:38,263 --> 00:37:40,964
There's nothing realistic
about a Chinese garden

741
00:37:40,966 --> 00:37:43,533
in the middle of Staten Island,
but...

742
00:37:43,535 --> 00:37:46,837
but it's, it's where
I want to be with him.

743
00:37:46,839 --> 00:37:49,038
How's Richie doing?

744
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,640
Richie?

745
00:37:50,642 --> 00:37:52,042
Oh, I never know
what's on his mind.

746
00:38:21,906 --> 00:38:25,042
I love your hair like this.
You look ten years younger.

747
00:38:25,044 --> 00:38:26,676
- You think?
- Uh-huh.

748
00:38:26,678 --> 00:38:28,812
Oh, I wish I had
your kind of hair.

749
00:38:28,814 --> 00:38:32,448
- Hey, Ginny.
- The rainy weather kills me.

750
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:34,051
Oh.

751
00:38:34,053 --> 00:38:35,618
- Oh, hi, hi.
- Hi.

752
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:38,388
Hi.
Um, this is Mickey.

753
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:40,691
- Hello.
- In case you never noticed,

754
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,191
he's the lifeguard
on Bay Seven.

755
00:38:42,193 --> 00:38:44,394
- Oh.
- This is my husband's daughter.

756
00:38:44,396 --> 00:38:47,430
- Carolina.
- I swim at Bay Seven sometimes.

757
00:38:47,432 --> 00:38:50,466
- You do?
- Mm-hmm.

758
00:38:50,468 --> 00:38:52,868
We have to go.

759
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:55,272
Just don't drown in Bay Seven
or they'll fire me.

760
00:38:57,142 --> 00:38:59,743
- We, we should get going.
- Okay.

761
00:38:59,745 --> 00:39:03,546
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

762
00:39:03,548 --> 00:39:05,948
- Cute.
- Do you like my hair?

763
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:09,118
Hmm?
Oh, yes, it's lovely.

764
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,587
Beautiful.

765
00:39:17,296 --> 00:39:19,495
Hey,
I saw your daughter last night.

766
00:39:19,497 --> 00:39:22,064
- She was with a soldier.
- Ah, Jesus Christ.

767
00:39:22,066 --> 00:39:24,267
You put a uniform on a guy
and they lose their head.

768
00:39:24,269 --> 00:39:26,368
- It's true.
- I saw her with a sailor.

769
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:28,904
She's a very patriotic girl.

770
00:39:28,906 --> 00:39:30,406
Ah, well,
she's pretty, Humpty.

771
00:39:30,408 --> 00:39:32,308
You gotta expect some trouble,
you know?

772
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:33,877
- That's right.
- Her mother was pretty.

773
00:39:33,879 --> 00:39:35,578
And a saint.

774
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,147
This girl's got a high IQ.

775
00:39:37,149 --> 00:39:39,116
Her mother saw the number.

776
00:39:39,118 --> 00:39:41,084
I play the IQ number,
but it never comes in.

777
00:39:41,086 --> 00:39:42,785
You know,
I'm sure she can handle herself.

778
00:39:42,787 --> 00:39:44,220
She's been married.
She knows the score.

779
00:39:44,222 --> 00:39:46,089
Yeah, he's right, you know.

780
00:39:46,091 --> 00:39:47,924
Once a woman's divorced,
she's fair game, you know?

781
00:39:47,926 --> 00:39:49,359
That's right.
I'm glad I got boys though.

782
00:39:49,361 --> 00:39:50,961
She's goin' to night school.

783
00:39:50,963 --> 00:39:52,529
She's gonna be
an English teacher.

784
00:39:52,531 --> 00:39:54,196
Yeah, right,
if some soldier doesn't

785
00:39:54,198 --> 00:39:55,899
- knock her up first.
- What the hell?

786
00:39:55,901 --> 00:39:57,533
Come on, come on,
I'm just kidding!

787
00:39:57,535 --> 00:39:59,336
Look, look how red he gets?
Look over at Humpty.

788
00:39:59,338 --> 00:40:01,171
What kind of thing
is that to say?

789
00:40:01,173 --> 00:40:02,973
She don't look like
any English teacher I in school.

790
00:40:02,975 --> 00:40:04,640
Yeah, yeah,
what school did you go to?

791
00:40:04,642 --> 00:40:06,176
You didn't go to school,
you idiot.

792
00:40:06,178 --> 00:40:08,080
I went to
the school of hard knocks.

793
00:40:09,414 --> 00:40:12,682
- Hi.
- Hey.

794
00:40:12,684 --> 00:40:14,984
- Remember me?
- Of course.

795
00:40:14,986 --> 00:40:16,653
We met outside the movie theater
the other night.

796
00:40:16,655 --> 00:40:18,654
- Yes.
- Oh, gosh.

797
00:40:18,656 --> 00:40:20,390
Yes, with Ginny.

798
00:40:20,392 --> 00:40:23,759
You said you sometimes use
Bay Seven.

799
00:40:23,761 --> 00:40:25,595
Yes, I remember.

800
00:40:25,597 --> 00:40:27,497
I was hoping to get some tan,

801
00:40:27,499 --> 00:40:31,037
- but it's gotten so overcast.
- Yeah, storm clouds.

802
00:40:31,937 --> 00:40:33,736
What is it?

803
00:40:33,738 --> 00:40:35,805
- <i>Hamlet and Oedipus...</i>
- Yeah.

804
00:40:35,807 --> 00:40:37,874
By Ernest Jones.

805
00:40:37,876 --> 00:40:40,109
My goodness,
that sounds deep.

806
00:40:40,111 --> 00:40:42,946
It's not that deep when you're
familiar with the total picture.

807
00:40:42,948 --> 00:40:45,048
What total picture is that?

808
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:47,551
Well, <i>Hamlet,</i> of course.

809
00:40:47,553 --> 00:40:50,086
I haven't read <i>Hamlet</i>
since high school.

810
00:40:50,088 --> 00:40:51,821
But you've seen it performed.

811
00:40:51,823 --> 00:40:53,756
Once.
And not very well.

812
00:40:53,758 --> 00:40:55,357
I love the theater,

813
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:57,060
but I haven't seen
that many shows.

814
00:40:57,062 --> 00:40:59,162
Ignorance is no sin.

815
00:40:59,164 --> 00:41:01,832
It just means your experience
hasn't brought you into contact

816
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:03,600
- with certain things.
- Hmm.

817
00:41:03,602 --> 00:41:04,734
Did you finish school?

818
00:41:04,736 --> 00:41:07,136
No, I got sidetracked.

819
00:41:07,138 --> 00:41:10,006
Yeah, me too.
Uncle Sam.

820
00:41:10,008 --> 00:41:11,511
What's your story?

821
00:41:12,477 --> 00:41:14,410
I got married too quickly.

822
00:41:14,412 --> 00:41:16,145
But it's all over.

823
00:41:16,147 --> 00:41:17,714
Wow.

824
00:41:17,716 --> 00:41:19,683
Marriage is a big step,
isn't it?

825
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:21,383
- Mm.
- Scary.

826
00:41:21,385 --> 00:41:22,921
What'd your husband do?

827
00:41:24,156 --> 00:41:26,522
Shouldn't you be looking out
for drowning people?

828
00:41:26,524 --> 00:41:28,524
No one ever drowns here,

829
00:41:28,526 --> 00:41:30,359
but I should.
Yes.

830
00:41:30,361 --> 00:41:33,095
Listen, I'm actually
through with this book,

831
00:41:33,097 --> 00:41:34,964
so if you want,
you can borrow it,

832
00:41:34,966 --> 00:41:36,131
and then when you're
finished with it

833
00:41:36,133 --> 00:41:37,500
we can discuss it more fully.

834
00:41:37,502 --> 00:41:39,301
- Really?
- Yeah.

835
00:41:39,303 --> 00:41:40,837
I'd like that.

836
00:41:40,839 --> 00:41:42,372
Yes.

837
00:42:05,196 --> 00:42:07,964
You know who I ran into
yesterday at the beach?

838
00:42:07,966 --> 00:42:09,633
The lifeguard, Mickey.

839
00:42:09,635 --> 00:42:11,301
- You did?
- Yeah.

840
00:42:11,303 --> 00:42:13,502
I was leaving and I noticed him,
so I said hello.

841
00:42:13,504 --> 00:42:15,906
He was sitting up there reading
and he dropped down

842
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:17,573
and we talked.

843
00:42:17,575 --> 00:42:19,676
He's very nice.

844
00:42:19,678 --> 00:42:20,910
Yeah?

845
00:42:20,912 --> 00:42:22,444
And he's well educated.

846
00:42:22,446 --> 00:42:25,982
He's studying at college
to write plays.

847
00:42:25,984 --> 00:42:27,417
- Uh-huh.
- I thought that

848
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:29,451
would interest you
since you acted.

849
00:42:29,453 --> 00:42:30,953
And he had a book
about <i>Hamlet,</i>

850
00:42:30,955 --> 00:42:33,490
a psychological study.

851
00:42:33,492 --> 00:42:35,024
Uh-huh.

852
00:42:35,026 --> 00:42:36,526
I haven't read <i>Hamlet</i>
for years,

853
00:42:36,528 --> 00:42:39,995
and he tried not
to make me feel so dumb.

854
00:42:39,997 --> 00:42:42,332
He was sweet.

855
00:42:42,334 --> 00:42:45,334
- How long'd you chat?
- Five minutes.

856
00:42:45,336 --> 00:42:47,537
I had to go home and shower
and dress for a date,

857
00:42:47,539 --> 00:42:50,439
a nice guy from night school
took me to the movies.

858
00:42:50,441 --> 00:42:53,345
Not that I'd like
to see him again.

859
00:42:54,046 --> 00:42:56,745
That's, that's all you talked
about with Mickey?

860
00:42:56,747 --> 00:42:58,480
Yeah.

861
00:42:58,482 --> 00:43:00,683
Actually...

862
00:43:00,685 --> 00:43:03,720
I kind of found him attractive.

863
00:43:03,722 --> 00:43:06,756
- Did you?
- I'm probably reading into it,

864
00:43:06,758 --> 00:43:09,692
but I think
he kind of liked me.

865
00:43:09,694 --> 00:43:13,763
He said I could borrow his book
and we could talk about it.

866
00:43:13,765 --> 00:43:16,533
That flounder was great.

867
00:43:16,535 --> 00:43:18,234
You know, that's the beauty
of being able

868
00:43:18,236 --> 00:43:20,537
to catch your supper fresh.

869
00:43:20,539 --> 00:43:24,808
It's not just the money.
It's the flavor.

870
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,508
- Carolina.
- Uh-huh?

871
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:31,046
Connie Ryan and Leo
think you're a knockout.

872
00:43:31,048 --> 00:43:32,816
Yeah, they kidded me

873
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:34,917
about seeing you
with that soldier.

874
00:43:34,919 --> 00:43:36,486
- Oh, Rusty Ford.
- Mm-hmm.

875
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:38,955
No, he's a real hero.
He fought in Okinawa.

876
00:43:38,957 --> 00:43:41,323
Hey, what am I, the hired help?

877
00:43:41,325 --> 00:43:43,593
You ever think
of clearing your own stuff?

878
00:43:43,595 --> 00:43:46,595
I'm sorry, I... every time I try,
you sit me back down.

879
00:43:46,597 --> 00:43:49,399
That's because we can't afford
to have any more dishes broken,

880
00:43:49,401 --> 00:43:52,167
but you could overrule me
and just be careful.

881
00:43:52,169 --> 00:43:54,169
Oh, of course.
No, I'm happy to help.

882
00:43:54,171 --> 00:43:56,906
I'd do the dishes,
but I just did my nails.

883
00:43:56,908 --> 00:43:58,808
Well, I don't feel
like doing them tonight.

884
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:01,076
She just did her nails.

885
00:44:01,078 --> 00:44:02,779
When you're married
to a man who got rich

886
00:44:02,781 --> 00:44:04,214
putting people's feet in cement,

887
00:44:04,216 --> 00:44:05,749
you probably never
had to do a dish.

888
00:44:05,751 --> 00:44:07,049
I'll do it.

889
00:44:07,051 --> 00:44:09,718
- I'll do it.
- I got it.

890
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:12,022
Starring as the waitress.

891
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:14,691
- Something's eating her.
- It's my fault.

892
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:16,392
I should insist
on doing more around here.

893
00:44:16,394 --> 00:44:17,694
- Well...
- No, she's right.

894
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:19,095
I'm not used to it,

895
00:44:19,097 --> 00:44:20,462
and between work and studying,
I...

896
00:44:20,464 --> 00:44:23,635
Listen, just get home early.
That's all.

897
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:27,636
Hey, was everything okay?

898
00:44:27,638 --> 00:44:29,439
Yeah.

899
00:44:29,441 --> 00:44:30,540
Why?

900
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:33,379
Well, you seemed
a little distracted.

901
00:44:35,147 --> 00:44:38,848
Carolina told me you
ran into her at the beach.

902
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:40,250
Ran into her?

903
00:44:40,252 --> 00:44:42,986
I nearly hit her in the head
with my book.

904
00:44:42,988 --> 00:44:44,787
She said you lent it to her.

905
00:44:44,789 --> 00:44:47,490
- Yeah, she was interested.
- You shouldn't read up there.

906
00:44:47,492 --> 00:44:49,426
People trust you
with their lives.

907
00:44:49,428 --> 00:44:51,227
So what'd you talk
to her about?

908
00:44:51,229 --> 00:44:53,296
Nothing.
My book, <i>Hamlet.</i>

909
00:44:53,298 --> 00:44:55,064
She said she quit school
to get married.

910
00:44:55,066 --> 00:44:56,832
To a gangster.

911
00:44:56,834 --> 00:44:58,435
Really?

912
00:44:58,437 --> 00:45:01,037
- How interesting.
- You find that interesting?

913
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:03,038
They're after her.
They wanna kill her.

914
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,274
You better be careful.

915
00:45:04,276 --> 00:45:05,875
I get the creeps
living with her.

916
00:45:05,877 --> 00:45:08,144
- I wish she'd move on.
- She never mentioned it.

917
00:45:08,146 --> 00:45:10,046
Well, she wouldn't.
She's embarrassed

918
00:45:10,048 --> 00:45:12,247
by how she screwed up her life.

919
00:45:12,249 --> 00:45:13,716
They want to find her
and kill her?

920
00:45:13,718 --> 00:45:16,185
You, you must be exaggerating.

921
00:45:16,187 --> 00:45:17,520
It's a long story.

922
00:45:17,522 --> 00:45:20,223
She's a canary.
She sings.

923
00:45:20,225 --> 00:45:21,991
That's terrible.

924
00:45:21,993 --> 00:45:23,526
She's young.
She's pretty.

925
00:45:23,528 --> 00:45:25,294
She should go where she's safe.

926
00:45:25,296 --> 00:45:27,296
I asked you the other day
if she was pretty,

927
00:45:27,298 --> 00:45:28,865
and you said, "Okay."

928
00:45:28,867 --> 00:45:31,767
Eh, it was so quick.
I didn't really get a good look.

929
00:45:31,769 --> 00:45:34,337
But at the beach
she had on a bathing suit.

930
00:45:34,339 --> 00:45:36,372
Yeah.
Well, sort of.

931
00:45:36,374 --> 00:45:38,341
You didn't get any ideas,
did you?

932
00:45:38,343 --> 00:45:40,375
- What kind of ideas?
- What do you think?

933
00:45:40,377 --> 00:45:42,712
Hey, will you give me a break?
What're you doing?

934
00:45:42,714 --> 00:45:45,982
She's not for you.
She's hiding out here.

935
00:45:45,984 --> 00:45:47,950
Her life's all topsy-turvy.

936
00:45:47,952 --> 00:45:49,752
I was just chatting with her.

937
00:45:49,754 --> 00:45:52,455
Well, I hope you didn't
say anything about us.

938
00:45:52,457 --> 00:45:54,089
You know,
she'll tell her father.

939
00:45:54,091 --> 00:45:55,825
That's what canaries do.
They sing.

940
00:45:55,827 --> 00:45:58,394
Of course I'm not gonna do that.
What do you think, I'm a dope?

941
00:45:58,396 --> 00:45:59,729
Let's get off this topic.

942
00:45:59,731 --> 00:46:02,432
Hey, you were in my dream
last night.

943
00:46:02,434 --> 00:46:03,899
Yeah?

944
00:46:03,901 --> 00:46:07,403
What, I'm supposed to be
flattered you dream of me?

945
00:46:07,405 --> 00:46:11,174
I rescued you in the dream.

946
00:46:11,176 --> 00:46:13,308
Rescue me.

947
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:14,910
What can I tell you?

948
00:46:14,912 --> 00:46:17,147
I'm not going to tell Ginny
my real feelings.

949
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:18,348
How could I?

950
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:21,017
But I was taken with Carolina.

951
00:46:21,019 --> 00:46:22,785
Something hit me right off.

952
00:46:22,787 --> 00:46:26,221
The more I talked with her,
the more I was intrigued by her.

953
00:46:26,223 --> 00:46:29,459
I felt a buzz all day
after our encounter.

954
00:46:29,461 --> 00:46:31,493
I'd like to see her again,
but, obviously,

955
00:46:31,495 --> 00:46:34,397
I can't be honest with Ginny
about that.

956
00:46:34,399 --> 00:46:36,432
The last thing I wanna do
is hurt Ginny.

957
00:46:36,434 --> 00:46:39,002
Or wreck a good thing.

958
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:41,904
Ginny's a very emotional woman.

959
00:46:41,906 --> 00:46:44,941
And how could I ever
explain things to Carolina?

960
00:46:44,943 --> 00:46:46,542
That's all I need.

961
00:46:46,544 --> 00:46:48,211
"Hey, I'm having an affair
with your stepmother

962
00:46:48,213 --> 00:46:51,117
who's cheating with me
on your father."

963
00:46:52,249 --> 00:46:54,450
<i>It's best
to forget about Carolina.</i>

964
00:46:54,452 --> 00:46:57,423
<i>A sweet dream,
but a dream.</i>

965
00:46:58,522 --> 00:47:01,024
<i>But, as in a Greek play,</i>
Ananke, <i>or fate,</i>

966
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:02,825
<i>rules so much of our destinies.</i>

967
00:47:02,827 --> 00:47:04,961
<i>First,
I accidentally drop my book,</i>

968
00:47:04,963 --> 00:47:06,662
<i>just missing her head,</i>

969
00:47:06,664 --> 00:47:08,865
<i>and now look what happens.</i>

970
00:47:13,738 --> 00:47:15,607
Oh.

971
00:47:19,144 --> 00:47:21,076
- Carolina!
- Huh?

972
00:47:21,078 --> 00:47:23,381
- Come on, get in!
- Oh.

973
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:28,685
Thank you.
God, I was getting soaked.

974
00:47:28,687 --> 00:47:30,419
Let me buy you
a cup of coffee.

975
00:47:30,421 --> 00:47:32,555
I can't.
I'll be late for work.

976
00:47:32,557 --> 00:47:34,957
I'll get you as close
to the boardwalk as I can.

977
00:47:34,959 --> 00:47:37,160
Okay.

978
00:47:41,031 --> 00:47:42,832
I knew what was going on,

979
00:47:42,834 --> 00:47:46,569
but you look the other way
when you're husband's hot stuff

980
00:47:46,571 --> 00:47:48,971
and 6 million women
are after him,

981
00:47:48,973 --> 00:47:50,573
but he wants you,

982
00:47:50,575 --> 00:47:53,408
and it's all jewelry
and furs and Florida

983
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:55,578
and the racetrack,
and the Copa,

984
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:58,413
and the roulette wheel in Cuba.
It's...

985
00:47:58,415 --> 00:48:01,250
Wow, you've really lived a life.

986
00:48:01,252 --> 00:48:03,019
It was great.

987
00:48:03,021 --> 00:48:04,687
Until it wasn't.

988
00:48:04,689 --> 00:48:06,990
And then it was a lot of arguing

989
00:48:06,992 --> 00:48:08,794
and getting pushed around.

990
00:48:10,394 --> 00:48:13,029
What'd you,
uh, what'd you argue over?

991
00:48:13,031 --> 00:48:16,468
Just sooner or later,
everything.

992
00:48:17,801 --> 00:48:21,941
It sounds exciting,
but it's an unreal way to live.

993
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:25,908
I want a family,
and, and I wanted peace.

994
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:28,310
So eventually,
the whole thing blew up

995
00:48:28,312 --> 00:48:30,779
and we split,

996
00:48:30,781 --> 00:48:34,651
but the FBI got to me
and I...

997
00:48:34,653 --> 00:48:38,287
I was all mixed up and scared
and I said things.

998
00:48:38,289 --> 00:48:40,656
Because I know things.

999
00:48:40,658 --> 00:48:44,629
So they hate me,
and, uh, they're scared.

1000
00:48:48,265 --> 00:48:50,566
I know where
all the bodies are buried.

1001
00:48:50,568 --> 00:48:54,002
Jesus, what a sheltered life
I have led.

1002
00:48:54,004 --> 00:48:58,508
I have book knowledge,
but you've really tasted life.

1003
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:00,910
You've been around the world.

1004
00:49:00,912 --> 00:49:03,979
Yeah, but you've been
around the block.

1005
00:49:03,981 --> 00:49:06,915
You think you'll always
be looking over your shoulder?

1006
00:49:06,917 --> 00:49:08,417
Everybody dies.

1007
00:49:08,419 --> 00:49:10,688
You can't walk around
thinking about it.

1008
00:49:11,455 --> 00:49:13,221
You're talking to a lifeguard.

1009
00:49:13,223 --> 00:49:16,292
And hopefully with time,
things change.

1010
00:49:16,294 --> 00:49:17,926
I-I get paid to save people.

1011
00:49:17,928 --> 00:49:20,229
You know, you'd be safe
in a place like Venice

1012
00:49:20,231 --> 00:49:23,066
or... or Bora Bora.

1013
00:49:23,068 --> 00:49:25,935
That's where I'm headed.

1014
00:49:25,937 --> 00:49:28,037
I'm gonna be late.

1015
00:49:28,039 --> 00:49:31,140
I'm really flattered
you opened up to me.

1016
00:49:31,142 --> 00:49:33,343
You have a kind face.

1017
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:35,745
And you have a beautiful face,

1018
00:49:35,747 --> 00:49:38,480
especially in this rain light.

1019
00:49:38,482 --> 00:49:40,582
Thank you for the lift.

1020
00:49:40,584 --> 00:49:42,185
I hope I didn't make you late.

1021
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:44,319
No, it's okay.

1022
00:49:44,321 --> 00:49:46,622
I'm glad I took you up
on the ride.

1023
00:49:46,624 --> 00:49:49,024
Bye.

1024
00:49:55,767 --> 00:49:57,366
- You're late.
- I'm sorry.

1025
00:49:57,368 --> 00:49:58,767
I got caught in the storm.

1026
00:49:58,769 --> 00:50:00,136
I'll explain it all
to you later.

1027
00:50:00,138 --> 00:50:01,703
I want your input.

1028
00:50:01,705 --> 00:50:03,638
Well, I can't do
all the work here by myself.

1029
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:05,640
I-I got a migraine,
wouldn't you know it.

1030
00:50:05,642 --> 00:50:07,209
Oh, it's the weather.

1031
00:50:07,211 --> 00:50:09,544
Well, get... but next time
get here on time.

1032
00:50:09,546 --> 00:50:11,214
I don't want to have
to cover for you.

1033
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:12,814
I'm usually very punctual.

1034
00:50:12,816 --> 00:50:14,616
"Usually" doesn't do it.
This is a job.

1035
00:50:14,618 --> 00:50:16,486
I know you're not
used to schedules.

1036
00:50:16,488 --> 00:50:18,654
Lucky Tiny's not here.

1037
00:50:18,656 --> 00:50:21,624
Can I talk to you
later when you're not so...

1038
00:50:21,626 --> 00:50:23,593
- when you're feeling better?
- About what?

1039
00:50:23,595 --> 00:50:25,428
Just some advice
when you're not so stressed.

1040
00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:27,430
Would you stop doing that
with your fingers?

1041
00:50:27,432 --> 00:50:29,732
- It would... it would help.
- Oh, it's when I get excited.

1042
00:50:29,734 --> 00:50:32,769
Look, I'm... my head's throbbing,
I-I had to do six tables alone,

1043
00:50:32,771 --> 00:50:34,870
I broke my neck
for two fat ladies,

1044
00:50:34,872 --> 00:50:36,772
and don't you know,
they stiffed me.

1045
00:50:36,774 --> 00:50:37,807
Hey!

1046
00:50:37,809 --> 00:50:39,841
I am very sorry I'm late.

1047
00:50:41,513 --> 00:50:44,046
But I was shopping, and when
I came out it was raining,

1048
00:50:44,048 --> 00:50:46,749
and you may have forgotten,
but today is a special day,

1049
00:50:46,751 --> 00:50:48,551
and I wanted to get it
gift wrapped for you.

1050
00:50:48,553 --> 00:50:51,787
God, don't tell me
you got me a present.

1051
00:50:51,789 --> 00:50:54,323
How often do you turn 40?
It's a milestone!

1052
00:50:54,325 --> 00:50:56,426
It's a tombstone.

1053
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:58,497
You're not getting it
till tonight.

1054
00:50:59,497 --> 00:51:02,031
Can we order some clams?

1055
00:51:02,033 --> 00:51:03,433
Uh, yeah.
Hey.

1056
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:05,334
Yeah.

1057
00:51:05,336 --> 00:51:07,102
Hi.

1058
00:51:07,104 --> 00:51:08,970
You can sit wherever you'd like.

1059
00:51:08,972 --> 00:51:12,875
I can't believe it's my birthday
and we can't be together.

1060
00:51:12,877 --> 00:51:16,081
I know Humpty's
got something planned.

1061
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:20,249
I don't need any present,
but I wouldn't mind dinner

1062
00:51:20,251 --> 00:51:22,821
someplace over candlelight.

1063
00:51:23,821 --> 00:51:26,455
You've got a birthday
coming up too.

1064
00:51:26,457 --> 00:51:28,290
I love that we're both Leos.

1065
00:51:28,292 --> 00:51:31,526
Leos are warm, generous,
protective,

1066
00:51:31,528 --> 00:51:33,129
beautiful.

1067
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:35,765
Oh, God,
I'm, I'm not beautiful tonight.

1068
00:51:35,767 --> 00:51:37,466
- I got this...
- Here you go.

1069
00:51:37,468 --> 00:51:38,868
I got this migraine.

1070
00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:40,236
Can I get you
anything else?

1071
00:51:40,238 --> 00:51:42,537
I gotta go.

1072
00:51:42,539 --> 00:51:44,173
I love you, Mickey.

1073
00:51:46,211 --> 00:51:48,580
There you go.
I said it.

1074
00:51:49,781 --> 00:51:52,184
- I'm coming.
- I gotta go.

1075
00:51:54,685 --> 00:51:57,285
And we wish you
a happy birthday.

1076
00:51:57,287 --> 00:51:58,654
Happy birthday!

1077
00:51:58,656 --> 00:51:59,988
Happy birthday, Ginny.

1078
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:01,890
And don't be depressed
over turning 40.

1079
00:52:01,892 --> 00:52:03,658
Hang onto it
because take it from me,

1080
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:05,294
in a blink of an eye,
you're gonna be 50...

1081
00:52:05,296 --> 00:52:07,162
- That's true.
- You're gonna wish you were 40.

1082
00:52:07,164 --> 00:52:09,732
Come on, let me do it,
let me do it, let me do it.

1083
00:52:09,734 --> 00:52:11,299
Come on,
you already sung into it.

1084
00:52:11,301 --> 00:52:13,236
It's a tape recorder.
It's a tape recorder.

1085
00:52:13,238 --> 00:52:14,537
This is an unbelievable machine.

1086
00:52:14,539 --> 00:52:16,071
Yeah, yeah, well, you know,

1087
00:52:16,073 --> 00:52:18,573
I thought she'd like it
for her birthday.

1088
00:52:18,575 --> 00:52:20,910
I got a great buy
on that tape recorder.

1089
00:52:20,912 --> 00:52:23,613
- It's stolen.
- What do you mean "stolen"?

1090
00:52:23,615 --> 00:52:25,915
Ah, some bum stole it.

1091
00:52:25,917 --> 00:52:28,718
He was trying to sell it
on the boardwalk, you know.

1092
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:29,986
Big spender.

1093
00:52:29,988 --> 00:52:31,888
Yeah, those guys will,
you know...

1094
00:52:31,890 --> 00:52:35,323
They'll do anything
to make money to buy a drink.

1095
00:52:35,325 --> 00:52:36,526
- So will I.
- Yeah.

1096
00:52:37,794 --> 00:52:39,562
I paid three bucks for it.

1097
00:52:39,564 --> 00:52:41,062
- $3?
- I mean, I couldn't afford

1098
00:52:41,064 --> 00:52:42,832
- a new one, right?
- That's a deal.

1099
00:52:42,834 --> 00:52:44,633
- I think so.
- That's a lot of fun,

1100
00:52:44,635 --> 00:52:46,167
- isn't it, Ginny?
- Oh, sure.

1101
00:52:46,169 --> 00:52:47,937
I wish I had
one of these things.

1102
00:52:47,939 --> 00:52:49,805
- It's great.
- What kind of birthday party

1103
00:52:49,807 --> 00:52:52,008
- is this with no booze?
- Oh, shut up, Ryan.

1104
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:53,375
Hey, come on,
it's a party.

1105
00:52:53,377 --> 00:52:54,743
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1106
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:01,651
Hey, wait, no, no.

1107
00:53:01,653 --> 00:53:03,953
If you're gonna sing, will you
at least get the words right?

1108
00:53:03,955 --> 00:53:05,720
Those are the right words.

1109
00:53:05,722 --> 00:53:07,423
"She loved the sailor
and he loved her too."

1110
00:53:07,425 --> 00:53:09,625
You know what?
I think it's time to go home.

1111
00:53:09,627 --> 00:53:11,861
- No, no.
- It's early, come on.

1112
00:53:11,863 --> 00:53:13,763
Now, you know what,
you should come out

1113
00:53:13,765 --> 00:53:15,531
on the boat on Saturday.
They're going for bluefish.

1114
00:53:15,533 --> 00:53:17,500
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Ah, she don't fish.

1115
00:53:17,502 --> 00:53:19,801
Well, neither do I,
but she can get a nice tan.

1116
00:53:19,803 --> 00:53:22,104
She don't do nothin'.
Come on, don't go.

1117
00:53:22,106 --> 00:53:25,508
Stay, stay. Come on.

1118
00:53:28,879 --> 00:53:31,413
Oh, look, it lights up

1119
00:53:31,415 --> 00:53:33,281
- when he's singing there.
- Isn't that nice?

1120
00:53:33,283 --> 00:53:34,716
Yeah, I love that.

1121
00:53:34,718 --> 00:53:36,419
Come on, wait.
Keep on going.

1122
00:53:39,856 --> 00:53:41,957
That's it.

1123
00:53:44,062 --> 00:53:46,495
Come on.
What do you mean, he was three?

1124
00:53:53,638 --> 00:53:55,705
Hi, are you okay?

1125
00:53:55,707 --> 00:53:59,107
Yeah, my head's cracking open.

1126
00:53:59,109 --> 00:54:01,711
I'm glad you liked the scarf.
It looks great on you.

1127
00:54:01,713 --> 00:54:03,879
Oh, thanks.

1128
00:54:03,881 --> 00:54:07,283
Jesus, are they ever
going home?

1129
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:09,852
Ugh, my sixth aspirin.

1130
00:54:09,854 --> 00:54:12,020
Hey, what did you want
to ask me about?

1131
00:54:12,022 --> 00:54:13,955
Oh, it can wait.
I just wanted to get your advice

1132
00:54:13,957 --> 00:54:16,160
on something concerning Mickey.

1133
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:19,328
- Mickey the lifeguard?
- Uh-huh.

1134
00:54:19,330 --> 00:54:20,796
But it can wait.

1135
00:54:20,798 --> 00:54:23,468
No, go ahead.
What about Mickey?

1136
00:54:24,468 --> 00:54:28,703
I ran into him today in the rain
and he gave me a lift.

1137
00:54:28,705 --> 00:54:31,107
He did?

1138
00:54:31,109 --> 00:54:33,511
Lucky me.
I would have been soaked.

1139
00:54:34,144 --> 00:54:37,145
Well, he just happened
to drive by?

1140
00:54:37,147 --> 00:54:40,616
Yeah, and we got
a chance to talk,

1141
00:54:40,618 --> 00:54:43,019
and I really think
there's something there.

1142
00:54:43,021 --> 00:54:45,120
Like what?

1143
00:54:45,122 --> 00:54:49,158
Well, he was very charming
and flirtatious.

1144
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,292
And he liked hearing
all about me.

1145
00:54:51,294 --> 00:54:53,763
I must say,
I found him very appealing.

1146
00:54:53,765 --> 00:54:55,930
Hey.

1147
00:54:55,932 --> 00:54:58,100
What're youse doing?

1148
00:54:58,102 --> 00:55:00,703
Why don't you come join us?
Y-y-you can sing.

1149
00:55:00,705 --> 00:55:02,071
You know "April Showers," right?

1150
00:55:02,073 --> 00:55:05,441
- We're just talking, Dad.
- Oh.

1151
00:55:05,443 --> 00:55:09,578
Aw, baby, I didn't get a chance
to give you your birthday kiss.

1152
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:11,346
Come on.

1153
00:55:11,348 --> 00:55:14,316
You know,
you're just as pretty today

1154
00:55:14,318 --> 00:55:18,319
as you were
when I first started dating you.

1155
00:55:18,321 --> 00:55:20,823
I'm a lucky guy.

1156
00:55:20,825 --> 00:55:22,691
Come on, join us.

1157
00:55:22,693 --> 00:55:24,459
We will.

1158
00:55:24,461 --> 00:55:26,761
What makes you think
he liked hearing your story?

1159
00:55:26,763 --> 00:55:28,029
Did he say anything?

1160
00:55:28,031 --> 00:55:29,899
He was clearly flirty.

1161
00:55:29,901 --> 00:55:33,134
- Yeah, it was obvious?
- Mm-hmm.

1162
00:55:33,136 --> 00:55:36,337
And we were sitting in the car
in the rain.

1163
00:55:36,339 --> 00:55:38,941
It was like being
in one of those love pictures.

1164
00:55:38,943 --> 00:55:40,341
Well, how far'd it go?

1165
00:55:40,343 --> 00:55:41,776
Did he take your hand
or anything?

1166
00:55:41,778 --> 00:55:43,412
No, we just talked,

1167
00:55:43,414 --> 00:55:46,816
and I told him all about Frank
and my marriage,

1168
00:55:46,818 --> 00:55:49,051
and he found the whole story
dramatic.

1169
00:55:49,053 --> 00:55:52,287
You opened up
to a guy you just met?

1170
00:55:52,289 --> 00:55:53,988
I know.
I...

1171
00:55:53,990 --> 00:55:57,058
I found myself
talking and talking.

1172
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:59,694
Oh, it's funny.
I...

1173
00:55:59,696 --> 00:56:01,363
I felt very at ease with him.

1174
00:56:01,365 --> 00:56:03,165
Even when I first met him.

1175
00:56:03,167 --> 00:56:05,468
Well, did he become familiar?
I mean, did he try anything?

1176
00:56:05,470 --> 00:56:06,705
Did he take your hand?

1177
00:56:07,472 --> 00:56:10,973
He said I had a beautiful face
in the rain light.

1178
00:56:10,975 --> 00:56:13,743
Isn't that a nice phrase,
"The rain light"?

1179
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:15,176
He's a poet.

1180
00:56:15,178 --> 00:56:17,879
Uh-huh, and did he
take your hand?

1181
00:56:17,881 --> 00:56:20,049
Christ, did he do anything?

1182
00:56:20,051 --> 00:56:21,984
Did he touch you?
Did, did he kiss you?

1183
00:56:21,986 --> 00:56:23,685
Why are you getting so heated?

1184
00:56:23,687 --> 00:56:26,287
Well, it's,
it's like pulling teeth.

1185
00:56:26,289 --> 00:56:29,357
God, between you and them
and my, my headache.

1186
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:31,392
Well, I told you
that this could wait.

1187
00:56:31,394 --> 00:56:33,729
Just continue.

1188
00:56:33,731 --> 00:56:36,131
He didn't touch me.

1189
00:56:36,133 --> 00:56:38,433
I'm telling you because
I probably over-interpreted it

1190
00:56:38,435 --> 00:56:41,069
because I-I wanted him to.

1191
00:56:41,071 --> 00:56:44,439
But that's why I'm asking you.
Because you know the guy.

1192
00:56:44,441 --> 00:56:46,642
So, so what's he like?

1193
00:56:46,644 --> 00:56:49,245
He's a loose talker.

1194
00:56:49,247 --> 00:56:51,814
My advice is to watch yourself.

1195
00:56:51,816 --> 00:56:53,415
Yeah, he fills your head
full of lies, but he...

1196
00:56:53,417 --> 00:56:56,285
and his reputation
is that he's a phony.

1197
00:56:56,287 --> 00:56:58,220
Really?

1198
00:56:58,222 --> 00:57:00,589
But he, he didn't do anything?
I mean, he didn't kiss you?

1199
00:57:00,591 --> 00:57:03,359
- Unless you're not telling me.
- Why wouldn't I tell you?

1200
00:57:03,361 --> 00:57:05,294
Then I say forget him.

1201
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:07,428
I happen to know
he's got a girlfriend

1202
00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:08,897
who he's in love with,

1203
00:57:08,899 --> 00:57:11,466
and maybe even plans to marry.

1204
00:57:11,468 --> 00:57:14,703
So my, my advice is,
is to keep away.

1205
00:57:14,705 --> 00:57:16,872
That's disappointing.

1206
00:57:16,874 --> 00:57:19,808
Well, honey, he'll,
he'll break your heart.

1207
00:57:19,810 --> 00:57:22,410
You know, is that what you want?

1208
00:57:22,412 --> 00:57:24,113
Are you sure?

1209
00:57:24,115 --> 00:57:27,049
Men can't be trusted.

1210
00:57:27,051 --> 00:57:28,651
I should talk.

1211
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:30,653
My husband trusted me
and I...

1212
00:57:30,655 --> 00:57:33,154
I hurt him.
I wrecked him.

1213
00:57:33,156 --> 00:57:35,624
I'm not sure he didn't kill
himself in some hotel room

1214
00:57:35,626 --> 00:57:37,593
in, in Philadelphia.

1215
00:57:37,595 --> 00:57:39,028
I-I don't wanna know about it.

1216
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:40,830
If he decides
to take 90 sleeping pills

1217
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:42,598
or 85, I'm sup...
I'm supposed to...

1218
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,366
supposed to blame myself.

1219
00:57:44,368 --> 00:57:46,801
Christ,
can they get the hell out?

1220
00:57:48,138 --> 00:57:49,872
Calm down, Ginny.
They're leaving.

1221
00:57:49,874 --> 00:57:51,372
I know him,

1222
00:57:51,374 --> 00:57:53,875
and I know him
well enough to know

1223
00:57:53,877 --> 00:57:56,111
you're not his type,

1224
00:57:56,113 --> 00:57:58,848
and he...
honey, he's taken.

1225
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:01,482
He's not free.

1226
00:58:01,484 --> 00:58:03,852
Okay.

1227
00:58:03,854 --> 00:58:05,888
That's why I asked you.

1228
00:58:05,890 --> 00:58:08,991
Come here, Richie.
Come say good-bye.

1229
00:58:08,993 --> 00:58:10,625
- See you later, kiddo.
- Bye.

1230
00:58:10,627 --> 00:58:12,962
- It was great to see you.
- Bye, sweetheart.

1231
00:58:12,964 --> 00:58:15,631
- Ginny, Ginny!
- Bye.

1232
00:58:15,633 --> 00:58:17,799
Happy birthday.

1233
00:58:19,903 --> 00:58:21,803
I didn't mean
to bother you with this.

1234
00:58:21,805 --> 00:58:23,906
Why don't you lie down?

1235
00:58:23,908 --> 00:58:26,008
Just because you're
a pretty young girl,

1236
00:58:26,010 --> 00:58:28,509
who's been pampered
and chased after,

1237
00:58:28,511 --> 00:58:31,379
you think every man
is a pushover.

1238
00:58:31,381 --> 00:58:33,147
Why are you saying that?

1239
00:58:33,149 --> 00:58:35,484
- What did I do?
- Well, it's true isn't it?

1240
00:58:35,486 --> 00:58:37,185
Car and drivers.

1241
00:58:37,187 --> 00:58:39,654
You know,
winters in Palm Beach.

1242
00:58:39,656 --> 00:58:41,526
God, who you kidding.

1243
00:58:42,959 --> 00:58:44,759
Hello?

1244
00:58:44,761 --> 00:58:47,029
What?

1245
00:58:47,031 --> 00:58:49,134
This is his mother.

1246
00:58:52,535 --> 00:58:53,935
Where?

1247
00:58:53,937 --> 00:58:55,874
When? Today?

1248
00:58:56,774 --> 00:58:58,374
Well, was anybody hurt?

1249
00:58:58,376 --> 00:59:00,845
But nobody got burned
or anything?

1250
00:59:01,912 --> 00:59:03,481
N-no.

1251
00:59:04,814 --> 00:59:06,684
No, I-I work then.

1252
00:59:07,484 --> 00:59:09,450
Well, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, there,

1253
00:59:09,452 --> 00:59:11,986
there's no, no reason
to involve the police.

1254
00:59:11,988 --> 00:59:13,721
Yeah.

1255
00:59:13,723 --> 00:59:15,124
Yes.

1256
00:59:15,126 --> 00:59:16,691
I'll be there.

1257
00:59:16,693 --> 00:59:19,528
9:30, uh-huh.
Thank you.

1258
00:59:21,798 --> 00:59:23,999
Put away that goddamn machine!

1259
00:59:24,001 --> 00:59:25,234
What I do?

1260
00:59:25,236 --> 00:59:27,201
You know what you did!

1261
00:59:27,203 --> 00:59:30,772
You made a fire in the basement
of an apartment house!

1262
00:59:30,774 --> 00:59:32,241
What the hell were you doing

1263
00:59:32,243 --> 00:59:35,009
in the basement
of an apartment house?

1264
00:59:35,011 --> 00:59:37,645
Listen to me!

1265
00:59:37,647 --> 00:59:39,314
They were gonna call the police.

1266
00:59:39,316 --> 00:59:40,982
We have to be see
the principal tomorrow.

1267
00:59:40,984 --> 00:59:43,285
What is wrong with you?
Huh?

1268
00:59:43,287 --> 00:59:45,553
You wanna,
you wanna kill somebody?

1269
00:59:45,555 --> 00:59:47,723
You wanna burn yourself
to death?

1270
00:59:47,725 --> 00:59:50,258
Ah, Jesus,
I can't take this close living.

1271
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:51,993
- What...
- Everything's coming apart.

1272
00:59:51,995 --> 00:59:54,330
- What, what's wrong?
- What's wrong

1273
00:59:54,332 --> 00:59:58,100
is one of these days he's
gonna kill someone with a fire.

1274
00:59:58,102 --> 01:00:00,301
- You did it again?
- Oh, God.

1275
01:00:00,303 --> 01:00:02,971
Where'd you get the sick habit
to make fires?

1276
01:00:02,973 --> 01:00:04,939
- Are you demented?
- You know what?

1277
01:00:04,941 --> 01:00:06,441
I swear, I catch you
with matches again,

1278
01:00:06,443 --> 01:00:08,076
I'm gonna beat your brains out,

1279
01:00:08,078 --> 01:00:09,444
and that goes
for your stealing too.

1280
01:00:09,446 --> 01:00:11,113
Okay, we're too crowded here,

1281
01:00:11,115 --> 01:00:12,680
and she's no help.

1282
01:00:12,682 --> 01:00:14,082
You know, you spoiled her,

1283
01:00:14,084 --> 01:00:15,817
her husband pampered her.

1284
01:00:15,819 --> 01:00:17,386
She's no good
in the restaurant.

1285
01:00:17,388 --> 01:00:19,787
Let her go to Mexico
where she's safe.

1286
01:00:19,789 --> 01:00:21,189
Oh, she's right.
I'll get out.

1287
01:00:21,191 --> 01:00:24,026
No.
No, you won't.

1288
01:00:24,028 --> 01:00:25,961
Where the hell you gonna go?

1289
01:00:25,963 --> 01:00:28,029
Business is off all over.

1290
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:30,064
Come on, we're broke.

1291
01:00:30,066 --> 01:00:32,700
No, no, you're finally
going to school.

1292
01:00:32,702 --> 01:00:35,303
You stay here till you get
your feet on the ground,

1293
01:00:35,305 --> 01:00:36,839
and then you can go.
Look at...

1294
01:00:36,841 --> 01:00:39,073
She's not happy
waiting on tables,

1295
01:00:39,075 --> 01:00:41,709
and she's no good at it.

1296
01:00:41,711 --> 01:00:43,145
All right.

1297
01:00:43,147 --> 01:00:45,413
Let's do something
about the kid.

1298
01:00:45,415 --> 01:00:46,814
You know what
I'm gonna do?

1299
01:00:46,816 --> 01:00:48,549
I'm gonna take my strap off

1300
01:00:48,551 --> 01:00:50,486
and I'm gonna teach you a lesson
you're never gonna forget.

1301
01:00:50,488 --> 01:00:53,087
- Hey, don't you dare.
- He started the fire.

1302
01:00:53,089 --> 01:00:54,455
How did this get to be about me?

1303
01:00:54,457 --> 01:00:56,457
Why can't she find a job
somewhere else?

1304
01:00:56,459 --> 01:00:58,727
Get a room and split the rent
with some girl.

1305
01:00:58,729 --> 01:01:02,031
What're you... come on, she's...
she's trying to go to school.

1306
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:03,564
She's trying to make a life,
all right?

1307
01:01:03,566 --> 01:01:06,401
She wants
to amount to something.

1308
01:01:06,403 --> 01:01:09,404
She's not gonna spend the rest
of her life waiting tables.

1309
01:01:09,406 --> 01:01:11,105
She's better than that.

1310
01:01:11,107 --> 01:01:13,375
It's 'cause
you're too close to her.

1311
01:01:13,377 --> 01:01:17,312
Honey, there's class
in this girl.

1312
01:01:17,314 --> 01:01:19,480
She made a mistake, all right?

1313
01:01:19,482 --> 01:01:21,549
And I swore
I'd never forgive her,

1314
01:01:21,551 --> 01:01:24,752
but it's not in my nature
to stay angry, honey.

1315
01:01:24,754 --> 01:01:27,089
And what about me?
Huh?

1316
01:01:27,091 --> 01:01:29,124
I don't wanna
be a waitress either!

1317
01:01:29,126 --> 01:01:31,160
There's more in me
than shucking oysters.

1318
01:01:31,162 --> 01:01:33,629
You're upset, baby.
All right?

1319
01:01:33,631 --> 01:01:35,730
Every birthday,
instead of celebrating,

1320
01:01:35,732 --> 01:01:37,598
you put on a long face.
Come on, honey.

1321
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:40,903
Ah, God, what I really need
is a drink,

1322
01:01:40,905 --> 01:01:43,839
but I can't have it 'cause
you'll fall off the wagon.

1323
01:01:43,841 --> 01:01:45,908
Ugh, go to bed!

1324
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:48,042
- Go to bed!
- Hey!

1325
01:01:50,814 --> 01:01:53,450
- Ugh.
- What the hell?

1326
01:01:57,120 --> 01:02:00,421
All right, here we go.

1327
01:02:00,423 --> 01:02:04,258
Hi, is the same time next
Thursday okay for you?

1328
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:07,296
I work.
I'll have to call you.

1329
01:02:07,298 --> 01:02:09,430
- He may have to come alone.
- Oh, that's fine.

1330
01:02:09,432 --> 01:02:10,933
- Okay.
- Okay.

1331
01:02:10,935 --> 01:02:13,271
- Thank you.
- Sure.

1332
01:02:14,305 --> 01:02:17,171
- How'd you like her?
- She was okay.

1333
01:02:17,173 --> 01:02:20,274
- Well, what'd she say?
- Nothing.

1334
01:02:20,276 --> 01:02:21,810
Well, I'm sure
she didn't say nothing.

1335
01:02:21,812 --> 01:02:24,879
- She asked a few questions.
- Like what?

1336
01:02:24,881 --> 01:02:27,249
- I don't know.
- Tell me.

1337
01:02:27,251 --> 01:02:29,283
I don't remember.

1338
01:02:29,285 --> 01:02:32,421
About my father and you
and Humpty.

1339
01:02:32,423 --> 01:02:34,857
And then what'd you say?

1340
01:02:34,859 --> 01:02:36,959
I don't remember.

1341
01:02:36,961 --> 01:02:38,861
Did you tell her I love you?

1342
01:02:38,863 --> 01:02:40,529
Did you tell her
I screwed up your life

1343
01:02:40,531 --> 01:02:42,230
by betraying your father?

1344
01:02:42,232 --> 01:02:44,933
Huh?
What'd she say to that?

1345
01:02:44,935 --> 01:02:46,968
She must have
a pretty low opinion of me.

1346
01:02:46,970 --> 01:02:50,238
I told her that it's your fault
my real father's gone.

1347
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:52,341
Where'd you get that from?

1348
01:02:52,343 --> 01:02:55,944
You just said it.
You say it all the time.

1349
01:02:55,946 --> 01:02:59,517
I told her it makes you cry
and you think you hear drums.

1350
01:03:01,252 --> 01:03:04,852
Hey, humpty.
Humpty.

1351
01:03:04,854 --> 01:03:07,156
He, he has to see this doctor.

1352
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:09,191
He has to see this doctor
once a week.

1353
01:03:09,193 --> 01:03:11,225
We need an extra $10 a week.

1354
01:03:11,227 --> 01:03:13,294
Don't look at me.
You see how business is.

1355
01:03:13,296 --> 01:03:15,263
Well, don't look
at me either.

1356
01:03:15,265 --> 01:03:17,165
- You have some money saved.
- What money?

1357
01:03:17,167 --> 01:03:19,935
Oh, God, plenty of money
from when you hit you number,

1358
01:03:19,937 --> 01:03:22,370
and since Carolina came,
you put away a few dollars

1359
01:03:22,372 --> 01:03:24,473
from your paycheck every week,
and you have some,

1360
01:03:24,475 --> 01:03:26,375
some money left
from selling the car.

1361
01:03:26,377 --> 01:03:29,611
Uh, listen, that,
that's for her school, okay?

1362
01:03:29,613 --> 01:03:32,046
- She earns money.
- What, Ruby's?

1363
01:03:32,048 --> 01:03:33,515
She makes peanuts.
Come on.

1364
01:03:33,517 --> 01:03:35,551
You, you got plenty
in that tin box,

1365
01:03:35,553 --> 01:03:38,086
and I-I need to pay
the psychiatrist.

1366
01:03:38,088 --> 01:03:40,321
I don't believe
in any of that crap.

1367
01:03:40,323 --> 01:03:42,024
You know, you just gotta
be stricter with him.

1368
01:03:42,026 --> 01:03:45,026
I-I've said it a dozen times.

1369
01:03:45,028 --> 01:03:48,029
I-I need some extra money, okay?

1370
01:03:48,031 --> 01:03:50,232
He, he needs help.

1371
01:03:50,234 --> 01:03:54,535
Well, for what?
What about my daughter?

1372
01:03:54,537 --> 01:03:56,604
All right, I'm not gonna
throw away her future

1373
01:03:56,606 --> 01:03:58,573
to pay for some
phony head doctor.

1374
01:03:58,575 --> 01:04:02,444
That's the biggest
goddamn racket.

1375
01:04:02,446 --> 01:04:04,212
What with the cigarettes?

1376
01:04:04,214 --> 01:04:06,550
I'm smoking.
I'm smoking.

1377
01:04:08,051 --> 01:04:10,752
Ginny, come on.

1378
01:04:10,754 --> 01:04:14,122
Coney's on the skids.
We don't raise enough to live.

1379
01:04:14,124 --> 01:04:16,591
Honey, honey,
I don't blame you for...

1380
01:04:16,593 --> 01:04:20,361
being moody.
I know you're moody.

1381
01:04:20,363 --> 01:04:22,564
Okay.

1382
01:04:22,566 --> 01:04:25,167
You know, I-I don't get it.

1383
01:04:25,169 --> 01:04:28,169
You're happy one minute

1384
01:04:28,171 --> 01:04:30,404
and then you get crazy.

1385
01:04:30,406 --> 01:04:33,875
You pick fights with Carolina
for no good goddamn reason.

1386
01:04:33,877 --> 01:04:36,078
She likes you.
Look at me.

1387
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:38,249
She likes you.

1388
01:04:40,184 --> 01:04:42,084
Come on.

1389
01:04:42,086 --> 01:04:44,419
What happened to us, huh?

1390
01:04:44,421 --> 01:04:46,354
We used to talk
to each other more.

1391
01:04:46,356 --> 01:04:48,089
We used to go fishing together.

1392
01:04:48,091 --> 01:04:49,691
- What...
- Your problem is

1393
01:04:49,693 --> 01:04:51,692
you're wrapped up in Carolina.
I told you that.

1394
01:04:51,694 --> 01:04:53,794
You scrimp and save for her.
You take her fishing with you.

1395
01:04:53,796 --> 01:04:55,564
You get angry
if she goes on a date.

1396
01:04:55,566 --> 01:04:58,466
And face it, Humpty,
you treat her like a girlfriend.

1397
01:04:58,468 --> 01:05:00,769
You're gonna be crushed
when she dumps you again,

1398
01:05:00,771 --> 01:05:04,038
and she, she will dump you,
and move on.

1399
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:06,308
You know what?

1400
01:05:06,310 --> 01:05:09,314
I cannot have
this conversation anymore.

1401
01:05:10,981 --> 01:05:13,515
You got a one-track mind,

1402
01:05:13,517 --> 01:05:16,453
and you've become insulting!

1403
01:05:23,426 --> 01:05:25,926
You remembered I loved it here.

1404
01:05:25,928 --> 01:05:28,029
Here.
Here's your present.

1405
01:05:28,031 --> 01:05:30,499
Happy birthday.

1406
01:05:30,501 --> 01:05:32,667
It's obviously a book.

1407
01:05:32,669 --> 01:05:34,405
Open it.

1408
01:05:35,972 --> 01:05:37,638
<i>The Plays of Eugene O'Neill.</i>

1409
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:39,607
You'll like them.
They're dark.

1410
01:05:39,609 --> 01:05:41,509
And he really knew the score.

1411
01:05:41,511 --> 01:05:43,477
You know, human nature
and existence.

1412
01:05:43,479 --> 01:05:45,580
I once acted
in a play of his.

1413
01:05:45,582 --> 01:05:46,948
Which?
I know them all.

1414
01:05:46,950 --> 01:05:48,383
It was just summer stock.

1415
01:05:48,385 --> 01:05:49,817
They did, uh,
<i>The Iceman Cometh.</i>

1416
01:05:49,819 --> 01:05:51,285
I-I played
one of the whores.

1417
01:05:51,287 --> 01:05:52,787
What power.

1418
01:05:52,789 --> 01:05:54,723
To write a play
about the human condition,

1419
01:05:54,725 --> 01:05:56,991
the tragic human condition.

1420
01:05:56,993 --> 01:06:00,330
How we have to lie to ourselves
in order to live.

1421
01:06:01,131 --> 01:06:04,669
Anyhow,
happy 40th.

1422
01:06:10,473 --> 01:06:12,973
Carolina says
you were flirting with her.

1423
01:06:12,975 --> 01:06:15,176
Flirting?

1424
01:06:15,178 --> 01:06:17,446
I gave her a lift in the rain.

1425
01:06:17,448 --> 01:06:19,480
You don't have to lie.

1426
01:06:19,482 --> 01:06:21,582
She said you parked
and had a long talk.

1427
01:06:21,584 --> 01:06:23,185
A flirtatious talk.

1428
01:06:23,187 --> 01:06:25,720
Did she get the impression
that I was flirting?

1429
01:06:25,722 --> 01:06:29,790
Uh, Jesus, I mean, I was
fascinated by her story.

1430
01:06:29,792 --> 01:06:32,461
This girl's lived a lifetime
in her 26 years.

1431
01:06:32,463 --> 01:06:34,395
Did you make a pass at her?

1432
01:06:34,397 --> 01:06:36,464
A pass?
God, no.

1433
01:06:36,466 --> 01:06:38,332
I gave her a lift.

1434
01:06:38,334 --> 01:06:40,167
Did you tell her she had
a beautiful face

1435
01:06:40,169 --> 01:06:41,738
in the rain light?

1436
01:06:42,406 --> 01:06:44,740
I don't remember.
I-I may have,

1437
01:06:44,742 --> 01:06:48,243
but what's wrong
with a compliment?

1438
01:06:48,245 --> 01:06:50,312
You know she's a marked woman.

1439
01:06:50,314 --> 01:06:52,214
I-I do.
She told me her story.

1440
01:06:52,216 --> 01:06:53,749
It's chilling.

1441
01:06:53,751 --> 01:06:56,250
Would you like
to spend more time with her?

1442
01:06:56,252 --> 01:06:58,352
Why do you say that?

1443
01:06:58,354 --> 01:07:00,122
Well, that's
the impression she got.

1444
01:07:00,124 --> 01:07:03,457
Look, this is supposed
to be your birthday celebration,

1445
01:07:03,459 --> 01:07:05,761
and it's turning into
the third degree.

1446
01:07:05,763 --> 01:07:08,562
Can't you see I'm jealous?

1447
01:07:08,564 --> 01:07:10,899
Nothing's happened
to be jealous of.

1448
01:07:10,901 --> 01:07:14,535
I was hoping we might have
a future together.

1449
01:07:14,537 --> 01:07:16,638
Yes, I know.

1450
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:19,540
I told you we'd talk about it
when the time comes.

1451
01:07:19,542 --> 01:07:21,542
If you told her
she had a beautiful face,

1452
01:07:21,544 --> 01:07:23,444
what the hell is,
is she supposed to think?

1453
01:07:23,446 --> 01:07:24,845
What the hell
am I supposed to think?

1454
01:07:24,847 --> 01:07:26,647
Hey, we were sitting in the car

1455
01:07:26,649 --> 01:07:28,283
on a rainy day.

1456
01:07:28,285 --> 01:07:30,551
That light would have
looked soft on any woman.

1457
01:07:30,553 --> 01:07:31,953
You know what?
This conversation

1458
01:07:31,955 --> 01:07:33,687
is starting to take
a crazy turn.

1459
01:07:33,689 --> 01:07:36,426
I've become consumed
with jealousy.

1460
01:07:38,194 --> 01:07:40,928
Can we start the day over?

1461
01:07:40,930 --> 01:07:43,432
I really hope you like
your birthday present.

1462
01:07:43,434 --> 01:07:45,966
O'Neill was a great one.

1463
01:07:45,968 --> 01:07:48,305
Great and terrifying.

1464
01:07:49,205 --> 01:07:52,473
<i>Of course I felt terrible.</i>

1465
01:07:52,475 --> 01:07:54,075
<i>I needed
to talk the situation over</i>

1466
01:07:54,077 --> 01:07:56,711
<i>with someone
a lot sharper than me.</i>

1467
01:07:56,713 --> 01:07:58,712
<i>I called my friend Jake Jacoby</i>

1468
01:07:58,714 --> 01:08:00,848
<i>who's a graduate student
at City College</i>

1469
01:08:00,850 --> 01:08:02,750
<i>in the philosophy department.</i>

1470
01:08:02,752 --> 01:08:06,654
It doesn't make sense because
you're not dealing with sense.

1471
01:08:06,656 --> 01:08:09,224
You're dealing with feelings.

1472
01:08:09,226 --> 01:08:10,826
Feelings, my friend,

1473
01:08:10,828 --> 01:08:12,560
it's a whole different
ball game.

1474
01:08:12,562 --> 01:08:16,264
The whole thing
is so irrational.

1475
01:08:16,266 --> 01:08:18,834
I've been seeing
this married woman all summer,

1476
01:08:18,836 --> 01:08:20,635
and she has these fantasies

1477
01:08:20,637 --> 01:08:23,904
of leaving her husband
and going away with me.

1478
01:08:23,906 --> 01:08:28,143
Her fondest wish would be
to divorce him and marry me.

1479
01:08:28,145 --> 01:08:31,078
And at times I see it

1480
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:33,548
and at times I don't.

1481
01:08:33,550 --> 01:08:37,518
She's older than me,
and I like that.

1482
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:39,621
Somehow it fits into
the romantic narrative

1483
01:08:39,623 --> 01:08:42,456
of the writer's life.

1484
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:46,460
But she's more than that.

1485
01:08:46,462 --> 01:08:49,163
So, so, so,
why am I hesitant?

1486
01:08:49,165 --> 01:08:51,099
One minute I'm not sure,
the next I'm ready

1487
01:08:51,101 --> 01:08:53,902
to take charge of her life,
to rescue her.

1488
01:08:53,904 --> 01:08:56,971
Can, can this Carolina
be relied on?

1489
01:08:56,973 --> 01:08:59,974
After all, she, she did
run away with gangsters

1490
01:08:59,976 --> 01:09:01,977
because she was
a thrill-seeker.

1491
01:09:01,979 --> 01:09:06,684
You know, did, did,
did she learn her lesson?

1492
01:09:07,684 --> 01:09:10,318
She may give you
a period of bliss,

1493
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:12,653
but will it sustain?

1494
01:09:12,655 --> 01:09:15,223
Will this other one be

1495
01:09:15,225 --> 01:09:17,459
a more solid fit for you?

1496
01:09:17,461 --> 01:09:19,760
When I hear you say it,

1497
01:09:19,762 --> 01:09:22,934
I think, "Yes, she would."

1498
01:09:23,833 --> 01:09:26,734
And, and Ginny's counting on me.
She's drowning.

1499
01:09:26,736 --> 01:09:31,273
And she'd be eternally grateful
for a lifeline.

1500
01:09:31,275 --> 01:09:33,041
And after all, you know,

1501
01:09:33,043 --> 01:09:35,743
a love so intense
as hers is for you

1502
01:09:35,745 --> 01:09:39,480
is a rare gift
to have bestowed on a man.

1503
01:09:44,221 --> 01:09:46,587
It's amazing
how lucid things become

1504
01:09:46,589 --> 01:09:48,557
when you get
an outside perspective.

1505
01:09:48,559 --> 01:09:53,394
At that moment, a fog lifted
and my choice was obvious.

1506
01:09:53,396 --> 01:09:55,296
Carolina was a lovely daydream,

1507
01:09:55,298 --> 01:09:59,233
but reality with all its pros
and cons belonged to Ginny.

1508
01:09:59,235 --> 01:10:02,469
All my silly schemes
to pursue Carolina seemed crazy,

1509
01:10:02,471 --> 01:10:06,076
and I made the decision to never
entertain that pipe dream again.

1510
01:10:07,311 --> 01:10:10,815
But, as Jake said, the heart
has its own hieroglyphics.

1511
01:10:11,781 --> 01:10:13,548
Maybe he was right.

1512
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:15,584
Hi.

1513
01:10:15,586 --> 01:10:18,053
I came to tell you something.

1514
01:10:18,055 --> 01:10:20,388
- Oh, yeah?
- I thought of you yesterday.

1515
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:21,956
I know you mentioned
that you loved pizza,

1516
01:10:21,958 --> 01:10:23,457
and somebody said he knew

1517
01:10:23,459 --> 01:10:24,858
the greatest pizza place
in Brooklyn,

1518
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:26,527
and he took me there
and he was right.

1519
01:10:26,529 --> 01:10:28,129
I thought you'd want
to know about it.

1520
01:10:28,131 --> 01:10:30,631
- Your boyfriend took you?
- It's called Capri.

1521
01:10:30,633 --> 01:10:33,001
It's a few blocks from the
boardwalk, not far from here.

1522
01:10:33,003 --> 01:10:34,969
Will you let me take you there?

1523
01:10:34,971 --> 01:10:37,871
I'm kind of busy
with school all week.

1524
01:10:37,873 --> 01:10:41,011
Uh, is Friday night good?

1525
01:10:43,046 --> 01:10:44,946
Friday I can do.

1526
01:10:44,948 --> 01:10:47,349
And he's not my boyfriend.

1527
01:11:07,236 --> 01:11:09,603
Good morning, ma'am.

1528
01:11:09,605 --> 01:11:12,006
Good morning.
Do you still have it?

1529
01:11:12,008 --> 01:11:13,977
Yes, I do.

1530
01:11:15,579 --> 01:11:18,112
I've got the money.

1531
01:11:18,114 --> 01:11:19,980
- Here.
- Great.

1532
01:11:23,186 --> 01:11:25,420
Oh, wonderful.

1533
01:11:25,422 --> 01:11:27,589
Can you take it in the back
and engrave it?

1534
01:11:27,591 --> 01:11:29,957
Of course.
What do you want it to say?

1535
01:12:23,113 --> 01:12:26,346
I'm glad we could steal
these few minutes.

1536
01:12:26,348 --> 01:12:28,416
No one'll see us
this end of the boardwalk.

1537
01:12:28,418 --> 01:12:31,419
It's, it's so private.

1538
01:12:31,421 --> 01:12:32,754
I wanted to talk to you.

1539
01:12:32,756 --> 01:12:36,124
First, I wanna talk to you.

1540
01:12:36,126 --> 01:12:37,492
Okay.

1541
01:12:37,494 --> 01:12:41,895
Don't look so worried,
mine is a nice thing.

1542
01:12:41,897 --> 01:12:44,168
What?

1543
01:12:46,136 --> 01:12:47,702
Did you miss me?

1544
01:12:47,704 --> 01:12:50,104
Well, you've been so busy
with your son and his school.

1545
01:12:50,106 --> 01:12:52,040
Oh, God.
That's not what I asked you!

1546
01:12:52,042 --> 01:12:53,974
- Did you miss me?
- Jesus, Ginny, take it easy.

1547
01:12:53,976 --> 01:12:55,676
Well, you're always so evasive.

1548
01:12:55,678 --> 01:12:58,679
You never wanna
talk about anything.

1549
01:12:58,681 --> 01:13:02,483
Okay, okay, look, look, I don't
wanna get off to a bad start.

1550
01:13:03,854 --> 01:13:06,821
Remember last week
it was my birthday?

1551
01:13:06,823 --> 01:13:09,957
- Yes.
- Well, today is yours.

1552
01:13:09,959 --> 01:13:11,760
How'd you know?

1553
01:13:11,762 --> 01:13:13,827
You mentioned it.

1554
01:13:13,829 --> 01:13:16,497
Remember, we're both Leos?

1555
01:13:16,499 --> 01:13:18,465
I mentioned it ages ago.

1556
01:13:18,467 --> 01:13:20,734
What a memory.

1557
01:13:20,736 --> 01:13:22,202
What is that?

1558
01:13:22,204 --> 01:13:24,505
- I got you a present.
- No.

1559
01:13:24,507 --> 01:13:27,211
Here.

1560
01:13:35,752 --> 01:13:39,888
Oh, God.
Y-you, you can't do that.

1561
01:13:39,890 --> 01:13:43,057
- Why not?
- It's not right.

1562
01:13:43,059 --> 01:13:45,260
- You got me a gift.
- I know, but...

1563
01:13:45,262 --> 01:13:47,694
What the hell?
I got you a book.

1564
01:13:47,696 --> 01:13:49,130
This is...

1565
01:13:49,132 --> 01:13:51,232
It's much too expensive.
I can't accept this.

1566
01:13:51,234 --> 01:13:52,800
How would you know
it's so expensive?

1567
01:13:52,802 --> 01:13:54,635
I've inquired
about this watch.

1568
01:13:54,637 --> 01:13:56,770
- I was with you.
- Ginny...

1569
01:13:56,772 --> 01:14:00,308
Okay, this is a $500 watch.

1570
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:02,076
But you always wanted
this watch.

1571
01:14:02,078 --> 01:14:03,978
Yes, but it's much
too extravagant.

1572
01:14:03,980 --> 01:14:05,947
- You can't afford this.
- That's my business.

1573
01:14:05,949 --> 01:14:08,950
And even if you could, it's much
too extravagant given...

1574
01:14:08,952 --> 01:14:10,684
Given what?
Given, given what?

1575
01:14:10,686 --> 01:14:12,120
It's too much to spend on me.

1576
01:14:12,122 --> 01:14:13,888
You shouldn't be
getting me jewelry.

1577
01:14:13,890 --> 01:14:16,927
Why not?
Is it too meaningful?

1578
01:14:17,561 --> 01:14:19,861
Oh, Christ, you inscribed it.

1579
01:14:19,863 --> 01:14:22,596
Yeah, read it.

1580
01:14:24,266 --> 01:14:26,800
Look...

1581
01:14:26,802 --> 01:14:28,769
we have to have a talk.

1582
01:14:28,771 --> 01:14:30,638
I thought you'd be excited.

1583
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:32,773
It's too much,
and I can't accept this watch.

1584
01:14:32,775 --> 01:14:34,576
- Stop saying that!
- You can't be buying me

1585
01:14:34,578 --> 01:14:36,510
a $500 watch.

1586
01:14:36,512 --> 01:14:38,011
Look... why?

1587
01:14:38,013 --> 01:14:39,447
You, you're always saying
what a,

1588
01:14:39,449 --> 01:14:41,849
what a beautiful,
perfect summer it's been,

1589
01:14:41,851 --> 01:14:43,885
and, and...

1590
01:14:43,887 --> 01:14:46,487
It's not right
given the circumstances.

1591
01:14:46,489 --> 01:14:47,889
What circumstances?

1592
01:14:47,891 --> 01:14:49,290
What are the goddamn
circumstances?

1593
01:14:49,292 --> 01:14:51,158
Okay, you're ready
to get very serious,

1594
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:53,327
and I'm just not ready.

1595
01:14:53,329 --> 01:14:55,395
Something's happened.
Some... something's happened.

1596
01:14:55,397 --> 01:14:57,799
Everything was, everything was
going so smoothly.

1597
01:14:57,801 --> 01:14:59,133
Something's gone wrong.

1598
01:14:59,135 --> 01:15:01,135
I don't want
to disappoint you.

1599
01:15:01,137 --> 01:15:03,604
Look, you, you said
you loved me.

1600
01:15:03,606 --> 01:15:05,810
Were you insincere?

1601
01:15:06,842 --> 01:15:09,643
- It's not that I wasn't trying.
- What?

1602
01:15:09,645 --> 01:15:11,246
Oh, Christ,
if you have to try...

1603
01:15:11,248 --> 01:15:13,046
- It's, it's not homework.
- I'm not saying

1604
01:15:13,048 --> 01:15:16,617
I don't have real feelings
for you.

1605
01:15:16,619 --> 01:15:18,518
Is it Carolina?

1606
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:21,589
Jesus Christ,
I hardly know Carolina.

1607
01:15:21,591 --> 01:15:24,291
But you wanna get to know her,
and I should wait around

1608
01:15:24,293 --> 01:15:26,594
- while you could try her out?
- Hey, I didn't say that.

1609
01:15:26,596 --> 01:15:28,662
I didn't say that.
You're losing it.

1610
01:15:28,664 --> 01:15:30,965
You know what?
You don't want it...

1611
01:15:30,967 --> 01:15:32,567
...forget it.
Huh?

1612
01:15:32,569 --> 01:15:33,902
Forget it!
Forget it!

1613
01:15:33,904 --> 01:15:36,103
What the hell are you doing,
Ginny?

1614
01:15:36,105 --> 01:15:39,340
- Are you crazy?
- Don't talk to me!

1615
01:15:39,342 --> 01:15:41,142
All right, you little punk,

1616
01:15:41,144 --> 01:15:42,943
Give me back that money
or I'm gonna kill you.

1617
01:15:42,945 --> 01:15:44,211
Hey, wh-what's going on?

1618
01:15:44,213 --> 01:15:45,679
I didn't take his money.

1619
01:15:45,681 --> 01:15:46,915
Don't tell me you little thief,

1620
01:15:46,917 --> 01:15:48,349
you're always stealing from me.

1621
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:50,050
He took 400 bucks
out of my tin box.

1622
01:15:50,052 --> 01:15:51,685
- I did not!
- You know what?

1623
01:15:51,687 --> 01:15:54,221
That's 400 bucks.
That's grand larceny.

1624
01:15:54,223 --> 01:15:56,157
You know,
I oughta bang it outta ya.

1625
01:15:56,159 --> 01:15:57,925
He didn't take it.

1626
01:15:57,927 --> 01:15:59,861
Don't, don't be tellin' me
he didn't take it.

1627
01:15:59,863 --> 01:16:01,261
You know, you're always
sticking up for him.

1628
01:16:01,263 --> 01:16:02,930
That's why he is the way he is.

1629
01:16:02,932 --> 01:16:04,299
Now you give me that money back.

1630
01:16:04,301 --> 01:16:06,466
- I took it.
- Don't make up a story.

1631
01:16:06,468 --> 01:16:09,306
I took the money,
not him.

1632
01:16:10,739 --> 01:16:12,139
You took it?

1633
01:16:12,141 --> 01:16:13,541
Yeah, I-I needed it

1634
01:16:13,543 --> 01:16:16,010
to pay for a psychiatrist
for him.

1635
01:16:16,012 --> 01:16:17,344
- What?
- That's right.

1636
01:16:17,346 --> 01:16:18,979
They're, they're a lot of money,

1637
01:16:18,981 --> 01:16:21,282
and, and he's been goin'
every few days.

1638
01:16:21,284 --> 01:16:23,318
I-I didn't want to tell you.

1639
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:25,719
You took my savings

1640
01:16:25,721 --> 01:16:27,287
to pay for a head doctor?

1641
01:16:27,289 --> 01:16:30,425
- Look, he needs help.
- Yeah, you know what,

1642
01:16:30,427 --> 01:16:32,393
I was saving that money
for Carolina's school.

1643
01:16:32,395 --> 01:16:35,630
Well, she'll just have to put
some of her dreams on hold.

1644
01:16:35,632 --> 01:16:37,098
I got a call from his doctor

1645
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:39,067
that he started a fire
in her waiting room.

1646
01:16:39,069 --> 01:16:40,969
Richie, is that so?

1647
01:16:40,971 --> 01:16:42,737
I don't wanna go back there.

1648
01:16:42,739 --> 01:16:45,105
You know what, you steal,
what kind of example is that?

1649
01:16:45,107 --> 01:16:46,273
- Jesus.
- Oh, God,

1650
01:16:46,275 --> 01:16:47,774
I can't handle this now.

1651
01:16:47,776 --> 01:16:49,544
Look, I'm, I'm late for work.

1652
01:16:49,546 --> 01:16:52,580
I am sick of waiting on tables,
and kicking in my salary

1653
01:16:52,582 --> 01:16:56,149
so that you can put away
your extra money for Carolina.

1654
01:16:56,151 --> 01:16:59,386
Oh, God,
now my head is pounding.

1655
01:16:59,388 --> 01:17:02,657
- So go take an aspirin.
- I don't want an aspirin.

1656
01:17:02,659 --> 01:17:06,463
- I want a scotch!
- Take an aspirin!

1657
01:17:08,230 --> 01:17:10,063
Je... so that's where
you've been hiding it?

1658
01:17:10,065 --> 01:17:11,432
I knew you had a stash,

1659
01:17:11,434 --> 01:17:13,100
and when I begged you
for a shot, you...

1660
01:17:13,102 --> 01:17:14,835
when I needed it,
you wouldn't give it to me,

1661
01:17:14,837 --> 01:17:16,970
- but when you need one, you...
- You're not allowed!

1662
01:17:16,972 --> 01:17:18,438
I knew you had a bottle.
I knew it.

1663
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:19,807
Hi.
I'm late.

1664
01:17:19,809 --> 01:17:21,142
I'm such a scatterbrain.

1665
01:17:21,144 --> 01:17:23,310
I have a date
and I forgot my wallet.

1666
01:17:23,312 --> 01:17:24,946
Uh, I'm meeting Mickey

1667
01:17:24,948 --> 01:17:27,348
and I found
this great pizza place.

1668
01:17:27,350 --> 01:17:29,082
It's his birthday,
so I'm treating.

1669
01:17:29,084 --> 01:17:31,184
You're... what?
You're going with Mickey?

1670
01:17:31,186 --> 01:17:32,620
Don't look so stunned.

1671
01:17:32,622 --> 01:17:34,354
You introduced me to him,
remember?

1672
01:17:34,356 --> 01:17:36,491
If he breaks my heart,
you're to blame.

1673
01:17:36,493 --> 01:17:38,593
I know you warned me,
but...

1674
01:17:38,595 --> 01:17:41,362
...I think he likes me,
and is sincere.

1675
01:17:41,364 --> 01:17:42,964
Not that anything's
happened yet,

1676
01:17:42,966 --> 01:17:45,066
but I'm hoping
tonight's the night.

1677
01:17:45,068 --> 01:17:47,902
Yes.
I've gotta go.

1678
01:17:47,904 --> 01:17:50,741
- Bye.
- Don't come home late.

1679
01:17:52,508 --> 01:17:56,176
- What're you doing?
- I'm drinking.

1680
01:17:56,178 --> 01:17:58,949
What does it look like
I'm doing?

1681
01:19:00,342 --> 01:19:02,309
- Tiny?
- Yeah?

1682
01:19:02,311 --> 01:19:04,144
Uh, the... those two guys
that were just here...

1683
01:19:04,146 --> 01:19:05,446
Yeah, they were looking
for Carolina.

1684
01:19:05,448 --> 01:19:07,215
How'd they know she worked here?

1685
01:19:07,217 --> 01:19:08,950
- I don't know.
- Well, what'd you tell 'em?

1686
01:19:08,952 --> 01:19:10,350
Nothing, I hope.

1687
01:19:10,352 --> 01:19:11,986
They said they needed
to find her.

1688
01:19:11,988 --> 01:19:13,688
I know she's having dinner
with some guy tonight

1689
01:19:13,690 --> 01:19:15,555
at the Capri Pizzeria
up on Beach Walk.

1690
01:19:15,557 --> 01:19:17,291
Oh, God,
I hope you didn't say that.

1691
01:19:17,293 --> 01:19:19,026
Yeah, I did.
Why, did I do wrong?

1692
01:19:19,028 --> 01:19:20,560
- Something wrong?
- Oh, God.

1693
01:19:20,562 --> 01:19:22,662
I have to make a phone call
before they get there.

1694
01:19:22,664 --> 01:19:24,465
- Uh, phone's not...
- Capri, the Italian restaurant?

1695
01:19:24,467 --> 01:19:26,134
Yeah, yeah, it's
not working though, the phone.

1696
01:19:26,136 --> 01:19:27,535
What do you mean the phone's
not, not work...

1697
01:19:27,537 --> 01:19:29,303
I don't know,
all day long.

1698
01:19:29,305 --> 01:19:31,072
Oh, Jesus, I have to make,
make a phone call.

1699
01:19:31,074 --> 01:19:33,355
- You need a nickel?
- I have to make a phone call.

1700
01:19:35,477 --> 01:19:38,448
I-I have, have to make
an emergency call.

1701
01:19:39,449 --> 01:19:41,849
All right, miss.
I-I gotta call you back.

1702
01:19:41,851 --> 01:19:43,151
There's an emergency here.

1703
01:19:43,153 --> 01:19:44,518
Someone needs
to make a phone call.

1704
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:46,153
All right, yeah.
No, I'll call you back.

1705
01:19:46,155 --> 01:19:48,156
Okay, thank you.

1706
01:19:52,529 --> 01:19:54,594
Yeah, I need the number
of a-a restaurant in Brooklyn

1707
01:19:54,596 --> 01:19:56,397
on Beach Walk
called Capri Pizzeria.

1708
01:19:57,833 --> 01:19:59,669
What?

1709
01:20:04,673 --> 01:20:07,508
- Capri, John speaking.
<i>- Yeah, Capri?</i>

1710
01:20:07,510 --> 01:20:10,545
Yeah, I-I need
to speak with a customer.

1711
01:20:10,547 --> 01:20:14,384
She has, she has,
uh, she has blo... blond...

1712
01:20:17,387 --> 01:20:20,190
<i>Hello?</i>

1713
01:20:21,024 --> 01:20:23,160
<i>Hello?</i>

1714
01:20:25,093 --> 01:20:27,663
<i>Capri.
Hello?</i>

1715
01:20:46,915 --> 01:20:49,282
Isn't it the best pizza
you've ever had in your life?

1716
01:20:49,284 --> 01:20:51,518
And I'm taking you.

1717
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:53,254
I have something
I wanna tell you.

1718
01:20:53,256 --> 01:20:54,822
If only it wasn't
so fattening.

1719
01:20:54,824 --> 01:20:56,624
But, of course, you don't have
to worry about that.

1720
01:20:56,626 --> 01:20:59,760
A few things
that I wanna tell you.

1721
01:20:59,762 --> 01:21:00,894
Yes?

1722
01:21:00,896 --> 01:21:03,563
First...

1723
01:21:03,565 --> 01:21:05,299
I'm in love with you.

1724
01:21:05,301 --> 01:21:06,867
You'll think I'm very silly,

1725
01:21:06,869 --> 01:21:09,970
but I believe firmly
in love at first sight.

1726
01:21:09,972 --> 01:21:13,608
Maybe because I'm writer
and we over-romanticize,

1727
01:21:13,610 --> 01:21:17,277
but you just rang
some sort of a bell with me

1728
01:21:17,279 --> 01:21:19,380
the minute I laid eyes on you.

1729
01:21:19,382 --> 01:21:21,852
I don't know what to say.

1730
01:21:23,352 --> 01:21:25,385
I don't want you
to say anything.

1731
01:21:25,387 --> 01:21:27,988
I don't expect you
to say anything,

1732
01:21:27,990 --> 01:21:30,224
but I still wanted you to know.

1733
01:21:30,226 --> 01:21:32,763
I'm glad you feel that way.

1734
01:21:34,864 --> 01:21:36,796
Now I'm going
to tell you something

1735
01:21:36,798 --> 01:21:39,433
that you're going to have
complicated feelings about,

1736
01:21:39,435 --> 01:21:41,234
and you may not be so thrilled
to hear it,

1737
01:21:41,236 --> 01:21:43,203
but I have to be honest.

1738
01:21:43,205 --> 01:21:45,171
Hmm.

1739
01:21:45,173 --> 01:21:47,774
Why'd I suddenly get nervous?

1740
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:51,214
I've been having an affair
with Ginny.

1741
01:21:52,114 --> 01:21:53,613
That's right.

1742
01:21:53,615 --> 01:21:55,782
She's very unhappily married
to your father,

1743
01:21:55,784 --> 01:21:58,184
and we met at the beach
and it began,

1744
01:21:58,186 --> 01:22:00,054
and while I like her very much,

1745
01:22:00,056 --> 01:22:03,691
and I've even tried to
convince myself that I love her,

1746
01:22:03,693 --> 01:22:06,393
but I'm just not
in love with her.

1747
01:22:06,395 --> 01:22:07,827
And she's looking for someone

1748
01:22:07,829 --> 01:22:10,130
to pull her out
of her unhappy marriage,

1749
01:22:10,132 --> 01:22:12,832
and it's never going to be me.

1750
01:22:12,834 --> 01:22:15,538
So I'm going to break with her
either way.

1751
01:22:16,306 --> 01:22:17,871
But I still
wanted you to know

1752
01:22:17,873 --> 01:22:19,976
the, the whole story.

1753
01:22:21,010 --> 01:22:24,077
This is gonna kill my father.

1754
01:22:24,079 --> 01:22:26,449
He's so dependent on her.

1755
01:22:27,850 --> 01:22:29,317
How...

1756
01:22:29,319 --> 01:22:33,054
...how awful for Ginny.

1757
01:22:33,056 --> 01:22:35,889
Oh, God, I...

1758
01:22:35,891 --> 01:22:38,158
I told her we were going
for dinner here tonight

1759
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:40,027
and that I...

1760
01:22:40,029 --> 01:22:43,600
I hoped that you'd finally
tell me how you felt about me.

1761
01:22:44,734 --> 01:22:46,666
And I did.

1762
01:22:46,668 --> 01:22:50,537
I don't know
how to take all of this.

1763
01:22:50,539 --> 01:22:52,139
I'm sure you don't.

1764
01:22:52,141 --> 01:22:55,675
It just seems to go
from one drama to another.

1765
01:22:55,677 --> 01:22:57,745
Can we get the check?

1766
01:22:57,747 --> 01:23:00,014
- I'll get it.
- No, no, no, no.

1767
01:23:00,016 --> 01:23:03,520
No, it's,
uh, it's my treat.

1768
01:23:05,988 --> 01:23:07,691
Thank you.

1769
01:23:08,591 --> 01:23:10,558
Hey, my car's
just around the corner.

1770
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:13,227
- I'll drop you off.
- I prefer to walk.

1771
01:23:13,229 --> 01:23:14,661
Okay, well, I'll walk with you.

1772
01:23:14,663 --> 01:23:17,533
No, I have
a lot of thinking to do.

1773
01:23:18,935 --> 01:23:21,202
Yeah, okay.

1774
01:23:21,204 --> 01:23:23,804
Yeah, got it.
Um, I'll call you later.

1775
01:23:23,806 --> 01:23:27,640
And I'm, I'm sorry
if I upset you.

1776
01:23:27,642 --> 01:23:29,812
It's a lot to take in.

1777
01:23:31,279 --> 01:23:33,649
It's nice to know
you love me.

1778
01:24:16,324 --> 01:24:17,625
Yes?

1779
01:24:17,627 --> 01:24:19,827
You take out my daughter
last night?

1780
01:24:19,829 --> 01:24:21,661
Oh, you're Carolina's father.

1781
01:24:21,663 --> 01:24:23,596
I'm Mickey Ruben.
I'm happy to meet you.

1782
01:24:23,598 --> 01:24:25,366
Yeah, well, where is she?

1783
01:24:25,368 --> 01:24:27,001
Now?
Isn't she at work?

1784
01:24:27,003 --> 01:24:29,773
No, no, no, she didn't come in.
I already called.

1785
01:24:30,573 --> 01:24:32,473
She didn't come home
last night?

1786
01:24:32,475 --> 01:24:34,241
She didn't stay with you?

1787
01:24:34,243 --> 01:24:36,079
No, she went home.

1788
01:24:36,745 --> 01:24:38,312
Listen, you could
tell me the truth.

1789
01:24:38,314 --> 01:24:39,779
You know,
I'm kind of worried about her.

1790
01:24:39,781 --> 01:24:41,948
We had a pizza
at Capri Pizzeria,

1791
01:24:41,950 --> 01:24:44,117
and then we left.
We had a nice time.

1792
01:24:44,119 --> 01:24:47,020
I offered to drive her home,
and she said she wanted to walk.

1793
01:24:47,022 --> 01:24:49,355
I-I told your daughter
that I cared for her very much,

1794
01:24:49,357 --> 01:24:50,925
and she wanted time
to think things over.

1795
01:24:50,927 --> 01:24:53,193
- Wait, what do you mean she didn't come home?
- She didn't sleep at your place?

1796
01:24:53,195 --> 01:24:54,862
No, I'm telling you.

1797
01:24:54,864 --> 01:24:56,697
We split up after dinner.
I told her I'd call her.

1798
01:24:56,699 --> 01:24:58,365
You know,
I'm gonna call the police.

1799
01:24:58,367 --> 01:25:00,501
They're gonna wanna check
your place out, you know that.

1800
01:25:00,503 --> 01:25:02,303
Listen, she wasn't at my place.

1801
01:25:02,305 --> 01:25:05,339
I live in Greenwich Village.
They're free to check it out.

1802
01:25:05,341 --> 01:25:07,140
Which way did she go
when you split up?

1803
01:25:07,142 --> 01:25:08,908
She went over
toward the boardwalk,

1804
01:25:08,910 --> 01:25:12,045
and I walked around the block
to get my car.

1805
01:25:12,047 --> 01:25:14,113
If you're lying to me...
if you're lying to me,

1806
01:25:14,115 --> 01:25:16,050
you're gonna be in
a lot of trouble, you know that?

1807
01:25:16,052 --> 01:25:19,489
Take it easy.
I'm as alarmed as you are.

1808
01:25:20,589 --> 01:25:23,823
She tell you that these,
these guys are after her?

1809
01:25:23,825 --> 01:25:25,859
I know her whole story,
but, but she didn't walk around

1810
01:25:25,861 --> 01:25:30,230
as if she was worried about it,
and I didn't see anybody.

1811
01:25:30,232 --> 01:25:32,636
Where the hell is she?

1812
01:25:39,107 --> 01:25:42,343
What's the matter, Mom?

1813
01:25:42,345 --> 01:25:43,810
Nothing.

1814
01:25:43,812 --> 01:25:46,216
Then why are you drinking?

1815
01:25:46,748 --> 01:25:49,716
- This is my first.
- Third.

1816
01:25:49,718 --> 01:25:51,684
Can I go to the movies?

1817
01:25:51,686 --> 01:25:54,020
Picture at the Neptune changed.

1818
01:25:54,022 --> 01:25:56,023
Oh, yeah?

1819
01:25:56,025 --> 01:25:57,558
What's there?

1820
01:25:57,560 --> 01:25:59,492
<i>Flying Down to Rio.</i>

1821
01:25:59,494 --> 01:26:01,996
Oh, Rio de Janeiro?

1822
01:26:01,998 --> 01:26:03,863
That sounds pretty good,
doesn't it?

1823
01:26:03,865 --> 01:26:09,370
- Yeah, you wanna come?
- To Rio or to the movies?

1824
01:26:09,372 --> 01:26:11,371
I'd like to go to Rio.

1825
01:26:11,373 --> 01:26:13,609
And never come back.

1826
01:26:14,644 --> 01:26:17,210
They got her.

1827
01:26:17,212 --> 01:26:18,879
They got Carolina.

1828
01:26:18,881 --> 01:26:21,247
Somehow, they knew
where she was,

1829
01:26:21,249 --> 01:26:23,651
- and they snatched her.
- Why, why do you say that?

1830
01:26:23,653 --> 01:26:25,118
I knew it.
I knew it.

1831
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:27,054
- Give me that.
- No, no, Humpty, no.

1832
01:26:27,056 --> 01:26:29,156
I'm not gonna argue with you.
You give me a hard time,

1833
01:26:29,158 --> 01:26:30,957
I'm gonna knock you through
the goddamn window.

1834
01:26:30,959 --> 01:26:33,327
- Give it to me.
- No, okay, okay, okay.

1835
01:26:33,329 --> 01:26:36,196
Okay, c-calm down.

1836
01:26:36,198 --> 01:26:38,197
I... no, no, they meant,

1837
01:26:38,199 --> 01:26:40,768
they meant to get her,
they meant to kill her,

1838
01:26:40,770 --> 01:26:42,702
and by now, she's probably dead.

1839
01:26:42,704 --> 01:26:44,304
No, wh... what are
you talking about?

1840
01:26:44,306 --> 01:26:45,839
You don't know anything.

1841
01:26:45,841 --> 01:26:48,242
Don't tell me I don't know
what I'm talking about.

1842
01:26:48,244 --> 01:26:49,977
I wasn't born yesterday.

1843
01:26:49,979 --> 01:26:53,714
They knew exactly where she was,
right down to the pizza joint.

1844
01:26:53,716 --> 01:26:55,883
I'm going to the movies.
Can I have 50 cents?

1845
01:26:55,885 --> 01:26:58,786
Goddamn it, here, here, here.

1846
01:26:58,788 --> 01:27:00,888
Take it! Take it!
Take it all!

1847
01:27:00,890 --> 01:27:03,724
Now you don't have to steal it.
I gave it to you.

1848
01:27:03,726 --> 01:27:05,826
Okay, okay, okay, well, did,
did you call the police?

1849
01:27:05,828 --> 01:27:09,598
- Ah, naturally!
- Well, they'll find her.

1850
01:27:10,865 --> 01:27:12,700
What the hell do you care?

1851
01:27:12,702 --> 01:27:14,835
What the hell do you care?
You don't even like her.

1852
01:27:14,837 --> 01:27:17,638
- So...
- You hated her.

1853
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:19,974
You were the one
who wanted her out.

1854
01:27:19,976 --> 01:27:22,175
- Stop it.
- No!

1855
01:27:22,177 --> 01:27:25,511
No, you, you were the one
making all the cracks

1856
01:27:25,513 --> 01:27:28,014
about how I'm too close to her.

1857
01:27:28,016 --> 01:27:29,716
You, you could have tipped 'em.

1858
01:27:29,718 --> 01:27:31,151
Well, I didn't,
so don't be crazy!

1859
01:27:31,153 --> 01:27:33,953
If you did, I will,
I will kill you.

1860
01:27:33,955 --> 01:27:35,855
Stop!
You're scaring me.

1861
01:27:35,857 --> 01:27:37,491
- Stop drinking!
- No, no, no.

1862
01:27:37,493 --> 01:27:40,928
Somehow, for some reason,
they knew, they knew.

1863
01:27:40,930 --> 01:27:42,862
- Why did they come back?
- Well, it wasn't me!

1864
01:27:42,864 --> 01:27:44,798
I'd never do that.
It's...

1865
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:47,734
I wouldn't know who or how
if I w-wanted to.

1866
01:27:47,736 --> 01:27:50,103
What, what do you,
what do you mean?

1867
01:27:50,105 --> 01:27:51,705
What do you mean,
"if you wanted to"?

1868
01:27:51,707 --> 01:27:53,107
- I wa...
- Did you?

1869
01:27:53,109 --> 01:27:54,875
I'd never do such a thing.
Oh, God.

1870
01:27:54,877 --> 01:27:56,676
Leave me alone.
You're hurting me.

1871
01:27:56,678 --> 01:27:58,645
Ah, you're hurting me.

1872
01:27:58,647 --> 01:28:01,014
Ginny, I'm sorry.
I-I can't believe this.

1873
01:28:01,016 --> 01:28:02,983
- I'm going nuts.
- I-I...

1874
01:28:02,985 --> 01:28:04,652
She finally comes back
and now this.

1875
01:28:04,654 --> 01:28:06,386
God, I don't want
to be around you...

1876
01:28:06,388 --> 01:28:07,888
around you
when you're like this.

1877
01:28:07,890 --> 01:28:09,790
Ginny, no, no, don't...
stay here!

1878
01:28:09,792 --> 01:28:11,524
I don't wanna be alone.
I can't handle this without you.

1879
01:28:11,526 --> 01:28:14,060
I gotta get some air.
God, I'm choking.

1880
01:28:14,062 --> 01:28:17,430
Ginny, Ginny,
I can't believe this.

1881
01:28:17,432 --> 01:28:19,299
I can't believe she's gone.

1882
01:28:19,301 --> 01:28:21,135
W-well, do...
well, don't look at me.

1883
01:28:21,137 --> 01:28:22,935
Don't, don't,
don't stare at me.

1884
01:28:22,937 --> 01:28:26,141
You look funny.

1885
01:28:27,776 --> 01:28:29,343
- You're imagining it.
- Goddamn it!

1886
01:28:30,945 --> 01:28:33,149
I need another drink!

1887
01:29:28,704 --> 01:29:30,571
What're you doing here?

1888
01:29:30,573 --> 01:29:32,773
I came to speak to you.

1889
01:29:32,775 --> 01:29:34,942
Oh, well, yes,
but do you think it was wise

1890
01:29:34,944 --> 01:29:36,276
to show up at my door?

1891
01:29:36,278 --> 01:29:40,179
I mean, I do have a husband,
you know.

1892
01:29:40,181 --> 01:29:42,715
My God...

1893
01:29:42,717 --> 01:29:45,352
...I was not expecting anyone.

1894
01:29:45,354 --> 01:29:48,421
I must look like
the wreck of the Hesperus.

1895
01:29:48,423 --> 01:29:49,923
I thought about it,
but in the end

1896
01:29:49,925 --> 01:29:52,192
I decided
to come here.

1897
01:29:52,194 --> 01:29:54,428
Oh, if you're,
if you're gonna tell me that

1898
01:29:54,430 --> 01:29:57,096
you've made a terrible mistake
and thrown away a relationship

1899
01:29:57,098 --> 01:29:59,398
with a woman you now realize
loved you in a way

1900
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:02,402
that you will probably
never experience again,

1901
01:30:02,404 --> 01:30:04,737
still...

1902
01:30:04,739 --> 01:30:07,441
it was reckless of you
to come to where I live.

1903
01:30:07,443 --> 01:30:10,510
It just so happens,
Humpty's out.

1904
01:30:10,512 --> 01:30:12,513
He's, uh... he, he got drunk

1905
01:30:12,515 --> 01:30:15,549
and he, he accused me
of unspeakable things.

1906
01:30:15,551 --> 01:30:17,584
I mean,
he's understandably distraught,

1907
01:30:17,586 --> 01:30:21,755
but, but he scares me.
He...

1908
01:30:21,757 --> 01:30:23,791
He scares me,
but I will say,

1909
01:30:23,793 --> 01:30:25,425
I told him many times.

1910
01:30:25,427 --> 01:30:27,693
"You're smothering that girl.
It's not healthy."

1911
01:30:27,695 --> 01:30:29,595
I mean, she's,
she's a grown woman.

1912
01:30:29,597 --> 01:30:31,130
She's a divorcee.

1913
01:30:31,132 --> 01:30:33,000
I-I mean, you'd think
she was 15 years old

1914
01:30:33,002 --> 01:30:35,135
the way he fussed over her
and hovered.

1915
01:30:35,137 --> 01:30:39,438
But, did she act strange
when you had dinner with her?

1916
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:41,508
Because she is
a strange creature.

1917
01:30:41,510 --> 01:30:43,676
I w... I warned you about that.

1918
01:30:43,678 --> 01:30:45,211
I mean, for all we know...

1919
01:30:45,213 --> 01:30:47,113
you know, maybe she's
gone back to her husband

1920
01:30:47,115 --> 01:30:49,916
or decided maybe Mexico
is best for her.

1921
01:30:49,918 --> 01:30:51,818
But I did warn you
she was marked.

1922
01:30:51,820 --> 01:30:54,720
You cast me aside
for a marked woman,

1923
01:30:54,722 --> 01:30:56,423
and now I hope
you're not asking,

1924
01:30:56,425 --> 01:30:59,358
"Is it possible to just
take up where we left off?"

1925
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:02,395
I mean, that's,
that's a little opportunistic,

1926
01:31:02,397 --> 01:31:04,764
wouldn't you say?
I mean, it kinda reads that way.

1927
01:31:04,766 --> 01:31:06,332
But when it comes to love,

1928
01:31:06,334 --> 01:31:09,469
we often turn out to be
our own worst enemy.

1929
01:31:09,471 --> 01:31:13,540
I suppose one of the advantages
of being a little older is that

1930
01:31:13,542 --> 01:31:16,076
we have more tolerance
for mistakes.

1931
01:31:16,078 --> 01:31:18,344
Because over the years,
we all have made our share.

1932
01:31:18,346 --> 01:31:22,616
That's... that's why forgiveness

1933
01:31:22,618 --> 01:31:25,152
is possible.

1934
01:31:25,154 --> 01:31:28,223
What a cold world
it would be without it.

1935
01:31:29,824 --> 01:31:32,494
I know the whole story, Ginny.

1936
01:31:34,495 --> 01:31:36,199
What story?

1937
01:31:37,533 --> 01:31:40,102
I know what it is you did.

1938
01:31:41,136 --> 01:31:44,203
I-I don't know
what you're referring to.

1939
01:31:44,205 --> 01:31:47,674
Oh, you've suddenly adopted
a supercilious tone of voice.

1940
01:31:47,676 --> 01:31:50,676
By now she's probably rubbed out
or dumped somewhere.

1941
01:31:50,678 --> 01:31:52,379
Oh, my God, this is awful.

1942
01:31:52,381 --> 01:31:55,916
"Rubbed out," "dumped."
My goodness.

1943
01:31:55,918 --> 01:32:00,053
Well, don't you think you're
being a little melodramatic?

1944
01:32:00,055 --> 01:32:02,054
I put it together.

1945
01:32:02,056 --> 01:32:05,591
I spoke to Humpty, to Tiny.

1946
01:32:05,593 --> 01:32:08,761
The phone at Ruby's
was out of order.

1947
01:32:08,763 --> 01:32:10,898
You used a payphone.

1948
01:32:10,900 --> 01:32:14,835
I spoke to John from Capri.

1949
01:32:14,837 --> 01:32:19,706
A woman called,
and then hung up.

1950
01:32:19,708 --> 01:32:21,041
I got it.

1951
01:32:21,043 --> 01:32:23,410
It doesn't take Sherlock Holmes

1952
01:32:23,412 --> 01:32:26,712
or, or Eugene O'Neill
to plot this one out.

1953
01:32:26,714 --> 01:32:28,581
A lifeguard can do it.

1954
01:32:28,583 --> 01:32:30,951
I don't know
what you're implying.

1955
01:32:30,953 --> 01:32:33,353
I'm not implying.

1956
01:32:33,355 --> 01:32:34,991
I'm accusing.

1957
01:32:36,557 --> 01:32:38,090
Accusing me?

1958
01:32:38,092 --> 01:32:39,693
You certainly don't
seem too concerned

1959
01:32:39,695 --> 01:32:42,362
- by her disappearance.
- How would you know?

1960
01:32:42,364 --> 01:32:44,331
What, because
I'm not a mass of hysteria?

1961
01:32:44,333 --> 01:32:47,466
Like her father who has
an unnatural attachment to her.

1962
01:32:47,468 --> 01:32:51,304
Plus, I think I should tell you,
I've had a few drinks.

1963
01:32:51,306 --> 01:32:54,441
I know I told you I never drink,
but...

1964
01:32:54,443 --> 01:32:57,077
when I'm under
severe emotional strain,

1965
01:32:57,079 --> 01:32:59,880
it's, you know,
it's just sometimes

1966
01:32:59,882 --> 01:33:02,849
the only thing that
keeps me head from throbbing.

1967
01:33:02,851 --> 01:33:04,483
You wanted her gone.

1968
01:33:04,485 --> 01:33:07,120
- Oh, please, you're delusional.
- No.

1969
01:33:07,122 --> 01:33:09,723
That you think that I could...
no, you know, I will...

1970
01:33:09,725 --> 01:33:12,024
I am not going to stand here

1971
01:33:12,026 --> 01:33:14,193
and have my character sullied

1972
01:33:14,195 --> 01:33:17,296
- by wild and fantastical insinuations.
- I didn't think you had it in you.

1973
01:33:17,298 --> 01:33:19,198
- What, that I-I lacked
sufficient stature?

1974
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:21,300
You had time to warn her,
and you hung up the phone.

1975
01:33:21,302 --> 01:33:24,170
That I was too mediocre a person
to rise to a tragic action?

1976
01:33:24,172 --> 01:33:26,439
Honey, I don't know
what fanciful scenario

1977
01:33:26,441 --> 01:33:28,675
you're writing in your own mind,
but I suggest you get a grip

1978
01:33:28,677 --> 01:33:30,544
- on your imagination.
- I can't believe this.

1979
01:33:30,546 --> 01:33:32,679
You had time to warn her.
You hung up the phone.

1980
01:33:32,681 --> 01:33:35,415
Well...

1981
01:33:35,417 --> 01:33:37,818
...maybe in the end,
you misread my body language.

1982
01:33:37,820 --> 01:33:41,520
I mean, you said it wasn't
an exact science.

1983
01:33:41,522 --> 01:33:43,790
You know?

1984
01:33:43,792 --> 01:33:46,193
I loved her.

1985
01:33:46,195 --> 01:33:48,761
Jesus Christ!

1986
01:33:48,763 --> 01:33:51,133
You just met her!

1987
01:33:52,133 --> 01:33:55,368
Well, no, I forgot,
you're a dreamer

1988
01:33:55,370 --> 01:33:57,203
who believes in
love at first sight.

1989
01:33:57,205 --> 01:33:58,572
You know, when I think of it...

1990
01:33:58,574 --> 01:34:00,273
when I think of it, I could...
I could...

1991
01:34:00,275 --> 01:34:03,343
What?
What?

1992
01:34:03,345 --> 01:34:05,647
What?

1993
01:34:07,315 --> 01:34:09,616
And you, you,
you could live with this!

1994
01:34:09,618 --> 01:34:11,354
Huh?

1995
01:34:12,354 --> 01:34:15,822
Oh, God, spare me the bad drama.

1996
01:34:15,824 --> 01:34:19,059
Oh, here.
Here.

1997
01:34:19,061 --> 01:34:20,926
Why don't you kill me?

1998
01:34:20,928 --> 01:34:22,496
And avenge her, huh?

1999
01:34:22,498 --> 01:34:25,398
Isn't... isn't that
the way it happened

2000
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:29,338
in the, uh, theater
in Athens?

2001
01:35:24,659 --> 01:35:28,196
What good are the police
if that's the job they do?

2002
01:35:30,364 --> 01:35:33,068
Police can't protect you.

2003
01:35:37,271 --> 01:35:39,473
You look a little crazy to me.

2004
01:35:43,345 --> 01:35:45,211
Why are you staring
at me like that?

2005
01:35:45,213 --> 01:35:48,751
- I'm fine.
- Staring at you like what?

2006
01:35:50,819 --> 01:35:53,953
Where'd you get the dress?

2007
01:35:53,955 --> 01:35:56,258
You're nuts.

2008
01:35:57,359 --> 01:36:01,094
You know, uh, uh, don't get
on my nerves, Ginny, okay?

2009
01:36:01,096 --> 01:36:04,898
I-I swear to God,
I will smash you.

2010
01:36:04,900 --> 01:36:07,370
I am not in the mood.

2011
01:36:08,503 --> 01:36:11,807
You... and you look
a little crazy to me.

2012
01:36:13,175 --> 01:36:15,511
Leave me alone.

2013
01:36:31,325 --> 01:36:33,829
G-Ginny, I'm sorry.

2014
01:36:35,263 --> 01:36:37,467
I'm sorry, Ginny.

2015
01:36:39,700 --> 01:36:42,135
Don't ever leave me.

2016
01:36:42,137 --> 01:36:43,870
That's not what
you were thinkin', was it?

2017
01:36:43,872 --> 01:36:48,140
I was thinking Richie'll
be home from the movies soon.

2018
01:36:48,142 --> 01:36:50,378
He'll be hungry.

2019
01:36:53,347 --> 01:36:56,118
I don't believe what happened.

2020
01:36:58,352 --> 01:37:01,457
You gotta get me through this
like you did...

2021
01:37:02,723 --> 01:37:05,058
Like you did.
Y-y-you know, y-you gotta...

2022
01:37:05,060 --> 01:37:07,897
I gotta wash my uniform.

2023
01:37:23,544 --> 01:37:26,645
Talked to Connie Ryan.

2024
01:37:26,647 --> 01:37:30,783
They're goin' fishin' Labor Day.

2025
01:37:30,785 --> 01:37:32,922
You wanna go?

2026
01:37:34,690 --> 01:37:36,759
No.

2027
01:37:38,493 --> 01:37:40,796
I don't like fishing.

2028
01:37:40,798 --> 01:37:44,230
