Yes.

(BARRIE) Yes, they certainly will.

Now that we're all here,

does anyone know
who this Authentic IRA is?

Are they even part of the IRA?

Some new upstarts
or something else entirely? Hmm?

They're trying to undermine everything
we've achieved over the last 19 years.

Well, I won't have it.

182
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,584
They don't have the support of the people
who said no to the violence.

we trace it back

And then we deal with this internally.

(BROMLEY) I assure you, this investigation
is our top priority, Mr. Quan.

who take pride in their atrocities.

Any attempt by you to contact them
is likely to end very badly.

01:04:01,587 --> 01:04:03,881
Four came up short. Two were yours.

790
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:06,008
Ten kilos of Semtex missing.

791
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:09,637
What in God's name are you doing?
My dumps were off-limits.

792
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:11,013
We were clear in that. Remember?

793
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:12,348
You were at the meeting.

794
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:14,851
If you knew they were short,
you should've handled it.

795
01:04:14,934 --> 01:04:18,521
They were in perfect order.
I checked 'em myself, and that's a fact.

796
01:04:21,482 --> 01:04:24,443
Christ, Liam, so the committee
knows it's my Semtex?

797
01:04:28,781 --> 01:04:31,993
Don't know who we can
trust anymore. Do we?

798
01:04:32,493 --> 01:04:33,995
Trust, or fear?

799
01:04:35,162 --> 01:04:37,290
In your case, mostly fear.

800
01:04:37,748 --> 01:04:39,709
Simple and brutal, like my da taught me.

801
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:45,631
Look, we have an opportunity here, Liam,
if you take the lead.

802
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,258
This Chinaman isn't helping matters,

803
01:04:47,341 --> 01:04:48,843
but let me get some locals
to hunt him down.

804
01:04:48,926 --> 01:04:50,845
- How much do you know?
- Plenty.

805
01:04:50,928 --> 01:04:53,389
Bomb in your office. Your farm. Your car.

806
01:04:53,472 --> 01:04:56,434
Mary and your daughter hiding out
in a London hotel, a bloody mess, it is.

807
01:04:56,517 --> 01:04:59,854
And the men sense weakness, as do the UVF.

808
01:04:59,937 --> 01:05:03,608
You should be back in Belfast,
out in front, taking charge.

809
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:06,652
- Look, I'm no politician...
- What're you trying to say?

810
01:05:07,528 --> 01:05:08,779
The bombing.

811
01:05:10,197 --> 01:05:13,701
A few quiet words of encouragement
would soothe the ranks.

812
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:15,202
"Encouragement"?

813
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:16,954
They kill civilians by the buckets.

814
01:05:17,038 --> 01:05:21,250
They went a bit far, I know,
but they have given us real momentum.

815
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:22,710
The Brits are on the ropes.

816
01:05:22,793 --> 01:05:26,839
Jesus Christ, I said hit a few
financial targets. That's it.

817
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:29,508
No one gets hurt.
That's what we agreed to.

818
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:32,637
- You gave me your word.
- And by God, I kept it.

819
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:36,307
I don't know who they are,
don't even know who's controlling 'em.

820
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:37,683
And that's the way it has to be.

821
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:40,811
Because, if something goes wrong,
they could trace 'em straight back to us.

822
01:05:40,895 --> 01:05:44,982
Go wrong? This wasn't the fuckin' plan.
I needed this to get our people back.

823
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:49,654
- You and I have spent our whole lifetime...
- You don't give a shit about those men.

824
01:05:49,737 --> 01:05:51,948
You needed the bombing
to shore up the election,

825
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:53,908
to prop up your weakness in the ranks.

826
01:05:53,991 --> 01:05:58,871
Well, guess what?
In the fog o' war, plans fuckin' change.

827
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:04,085
Now, I stood by you
when you put fire into the lads.

829
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,590
You were calling for an escalation then,
right enough.

830

Those days are long gone!

831

That's not what I heard a few months ago.

I heard the old Liam,
a man back on track with a plan.

You haven't forgotten
what we're fighting for, have ya?

You question my loyalty?

835
01:06:29,568 --> 01:06:33,781
I buried my brother-in-law,
before that my da and my two cousins.

836
01:06:33,864 --> 01:06:37,243
We spilt our fair share of blood
struggling for united Ireland,

837
01:06:37,326 --> 01:06:39,370
not profiting off a divided one.

838
01:06:39,453 --> 01:06:42,540
So, don't fucking go asking me again
if I've forgotten what we're fighting for.

is that what you want?

Well then, hear this.

and end it,

Right. I'm going now.

When they claim responsibility
for the next bombing,

they'll use a code word,
