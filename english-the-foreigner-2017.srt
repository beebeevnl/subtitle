00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:14,330
These people are suspects
in many things, including murder.

133
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:17,700
These people are critical
to holding the peace together now.

134
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:21,870
A few letters of pardon
would be a small gesture.

135
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,170
- <b><font color="#9b75ff">(</font> <font face="Mistral" color="#80ff00">ELEVATOR BELL CHIMES</font> <font color="#9b75ff">)</font></b>
- We keep it quiet.

136
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,590
But knowing it's been considered,
gives me leeway

137
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:29,260
to press certain men
for something in return.

138
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:31,800
As Irish Deputy Minister,

139
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:33,780
you have served the British
government honorably,

140
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,430
which hasn't always been easy.

141
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,720
But appeasement is a dangerous thing.

142
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:40,060

would smack of appeasement.

144
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,650
I need something, Kate.

145
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:47,070
The newer members haven't
lived the bloodshed and are easily swayed.

146
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,280
I'm trying to hold this together.

147
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,990
A gesture is all.
It would make a difference.

148
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,910
I'll consider it.

149
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,540
But I want something first,
something real.

150
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:02,920
Understood.

Quan.

Who did this?

161

As of now, sir, we don't know,
but we're going to find out.

162
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,390
Why my daughter?

163
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,480
Is there someone we can call

These bombers, will you catch them?

Yes.

Been a long time, Liam.

175
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:59,160
It's been a long time, indeed.
Go on, take a chair, there.

176

<b><font color="#9b75ff">(</font> <font face="Mistral" color="#80ff00">MAN</font> <font color="#9b75ff">)</font></b> All right, Hugh?

177
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,040
Now that we're all here,

178
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,870
does anyone know
who this Authentic IRA is?

179
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,710
Are they even part of the IRA?

180
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:16,300
Some new upstarts
or something else entirely? Hmm?

181
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:21,260
They're trying to undermine everything
we've achieved over the last 19 years.

182
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,680
Well, I won't have it.

183
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:26,640
They don't have the support of the people
who said no to the violence.

184
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,190
Our mandate's to uphold that choice

185
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:31,480
and maintain the Peace Accord
no matter what.

186
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,650
Are we in agreement?

187
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:35,530
There's a lot of support for their actions
amongst the younger ranks.

188
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:36,820
Hotheads.

189
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,280
Hotheads who don't remember
or know any better.

190
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,700
You were once one of those hotheads, Liam.

191
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,080
Aye.

192
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,580
Long ago, when it was the only way.

193
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,960
And what did it give us?

194
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:50,670
More graves than I care to remember.

195
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,250
This bombing rivals Omagh
with its civilian deaths.

196
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:58,170
It's unacceptable, anytime, anywhere!

197
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:00,430
And do you think the bombers
come from our ranks?

198
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:02,550
The Brits ID'd the explosive.

199
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,310
Czech-made Semtex from our dumps.

200
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,190
- <b><font color="#9b75ff">(</font> <font face="Mistral" color="#80ff00">ELEVATOR BELL CHIMES</font> <font color="#9b75ff">)</font></b>
- They also used our code word.

201
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,100
Which means they have
a contact in our command.

202
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,570
Maybe someone in this room.

203
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,820
They're trying to divide us,

204
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:24,450
put the Brits back on the streets again,
stir up the troubles all over again.

205
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:25,830
Well, I won't have it!

206
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:29,330
I want a complete check
of all the arms dumps here and abroad,

207
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,710
everything verified,

208
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:33,330
guns, Semtex, the whole fuckin' lot.

209
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,420
- <b><font color="#9b75ff">(</font> <font face="Mistral" color="#80ff00">PATTY</font> <font color="#9b75ff">)</font></b> Jesus, you can't be serious.
- Never been more so, Patty.

210
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,880
We check 'em, and if something's missing,

211
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,470
we trace it back
to those who knew the location.

212
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:45,050
And then we deal with this internally.

213
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,680
Unless someone here's got a better idea.

214
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:49,390
What do we get in return?

215
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:50,940
Peace.

216
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:54,190
Is that so bad, Brennan?

217
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,480
Haven't you paid enough in family blood?

218
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,860
So, unless you all
want to trash what we have,

219
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:04,700
I need your full support and respect.

220
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:07,660
I want a complete list
of all the stocks within the week,

221
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,790
along with their locations,
and everyone who knows where they are.

222
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,870
And no fuckin' exceptions!

223

225
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:31,640

Now, this is the first
CC feed we have on him.

228
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:40,360
Heading southbound on the A413
near Wendover at 10:53 a.m.

229
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,490
We retrieved the serial number
from the bike's frame.

230
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:46,280
It was reported stolen
in Reading the night before.

231
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:49,540
The license plates were also stolen
from another bike in Reading.

232
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,250
What about phone calls?

233
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,500
Assuming that the bomb
was phone-activated,

234
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,920
we've dumped the five closest towers
to the blast zone

244
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:16,650

to find those who killed your daughter.

248
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:34,500
But they're a difficult people to catch.

249
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:36,790
And it may take some time.

250

I need you to understand that.

Again, it's our top priority.

253

Twenty thousand pound.

254

All I have for the names of the bombers.

255
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,530
- I'm sorry, but we can't take this.
- Then please tell me...

256
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,110
Just give me the name
of someone in the IRA.

257
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,660
To be clear, these are vicious men
who take pride in their atrocities.

258
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:16,790
Any attempt by you to contact them
is likely to end very badly.

259
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,170
This is our work, not yours.

260
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:21,540
You need to be patient.

261
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,220
How long have you been
in this country, Mr. Quan?

262
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:35,100
Since 1984. I'm a British citizen.

263
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,980
You were born in Guangxi, China.

264
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,900
Yes. I'm Chinese Nung.

265
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,360
I work in Saigon after the war.

266
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,940
We escaped to Singapore.

267
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,660
Then we immigrate here.

268
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,910

Deputy Minister Hennessy,

you've publicly condemned the bombings.

Yet, as a former leader of Sinn Fein

290

291

you took part in similar events years ago.

those acts you were involved in then

So, what do you want, Mr. Morrison?

We've a plan.

Different codes will be given
to each member of command.

594

When the bombers claim credit
for the next attack,

you'll tell us which word they use.

the orders and then we end it.

Who else is involved in this plan?

Liam Hennessy.

the need for discretion.

600

Only Liam knows
who will be given which word.

So, Hennessy will personally work with us
to take out an IRA cell?

We found some plastic bags in his room.

608

he's brewed up some nitroglycerin,

609

He's hardly likely to know

it's you he's after, not me.

Well, the point is,
if he knows about the farmhouse,

I assume he knows about Keri's flat.

01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:02,440
Liam found out who killed him.

767
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:07,740
A UVF death squad. Four men.

768
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:13,580
I told Liam to kill them
before they got to court.

769
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:15,160
But he said no.

770
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:18,370
That the time for revenge is past.

771
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:22,960
So, my Patrick is dead and buried,

772
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:26,260
and they're sitting in jail now,
all four of them,

773

We're checking everyone's. No exceptions.

Four came up short. Two were yours.

791

Ten kilos of Semtex missing.

792
01:04:32,150 --> 01:04:35,700
What in God's name are you doing?
My dumps were off-limits.

793
01:04:35,780 --> 01:04:37,070
We were clear in that. Remember?

794
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:38,410
You were at the meeting.

795
01:04:38,950 --> 01:04:40,970
If you knew they were short,
you should've handled it.

796
01:04:40,990 --> 01:04:44,580
They were in perfect order.
I checked 'em myself, and that's a fact.

797
01:04:47,540 --> 01:04:50,500
Christ, Liam, so the committee
knows it's my Semtex?

798
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:58,050
Don't know who we can
trust anymore. Do we?

799
01:04:58,550 --> 01:05:00,050
Trust, or fear?

800
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:03,350
In your case, mostly fear.

801
01:05:03,810 --> 01:05:05,770
Simple and brutal, like my da taught me.

802
01:05:07,770 --> 01:05:11,690
Look, we have an opportunity here, Liam,
if you take the lead.

803
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:13,340
This Chinaman isn't helping matters,

804
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:14,960
but let me get some locals
to hunt him down.

805
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:16,900
- How much do you know?
- Plenty.

806
01:05:16,990 --> 01:05:19,450
Bomb in your office. Your farm. Your car.

807
01:05:19,530 --> 01:05:22,490
Mary and your daughter hiding out
in a London hotel, a bloody mess, it is.

808
01:05:22,580 --> 01:05:25,910
And the men sense weakness, as do the UVF.

809
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,670
You should be back in Belfast,
out in front, taking charge.

810
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:32,710
- Look, I'm no politician...
- What're you trying to say?

811
01:05:33,590 --> 01:05:34,840
The bombing.

812
01:05:36,260 --> 01:05:39,760
A few quiet words of encouragement
would soothe the ranks.

813
01:05:40,050 --> 01:05:41,260
"Encouragement"?

814
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:43,010
They kill civilians by the buckets.

815
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:47,310
They went a bit far, I know,
but they have given us real momentum.

816
01:05:47,390 --> 01:05:48,770
The Brits are on the ropes.

817
01:05:48,850 --> 01:05:52,900
Jesus Christ, I said hit a few
financial targets. That's it.

818
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:55,570
No one gets hurt.
That's what we agreed to.

819
01:05:55,650 --> 01:05:58,700
- You gave me your word.
- And by God, I kept it.

820
01:05:58,780 --> 01:06:02,370
I don't know who they are,
don't even know who's controlling 'em.

821
01:06:02,450 --> 01:06:03,740
And that's the way it has to be.

822
01:06:03,830 --> 01:06:06,870
Because, if something goes wrong,
they could trace 'em straight back to us.

823
01:06:06,950 --> 01:06:11,040
Go wrong? This wasn't the fuckin' plan.
I needed this to get our people back.

824
01:06:11,250 --> 01:06:15,710
- You and I have spent our whole lifetime...
- You don't give a shit about those men.

825
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:18,010
You needed the bombing
to shore up the election,

826
01:06:18,090 --> 01:06:19,970
to prop up your weakness in the ranks.

827
01:06:20,050 --> 01:06:24,930
Well, guess what?
In the fog o' war, plans fuckin' change.

828
01:06:26,180 --> 01:06:30,140
Now, I stood by you
when you put fire into the lads.

829
01:06:30,230 --> 01:06:33,350
M62, Aldershot, Mountbatten.

830
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:35,650
You were calling for an escalation then,
right enough.

831
01:06:35,730 --> 01:06:37,980
Those days are long gone!

832

833

I heard the old Liam,
a man back on track with a plan.

834
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,790
You haven't forgotten
what we're fighting for, have ya?

835
01:06:53,370 --> 01:06:54,790
You question my loyalty?

836
01:06:55,630 --> 01:06:59,840
I buried my brother-in-law,
before that my da and my two cousins.

837
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:03,300
We spilt our fair share of blood
struggling for united Ireland,

838
01:07:03,380 --> 01:07:05,430
not profiting off a divided one.

839

So, don't fucking go asking me again
