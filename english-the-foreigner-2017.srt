1
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,300
- You like it?
- All right.

2
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:15,760
I need to go. My dad's here.

3
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,300
- I'll see you tonight.
- Yeah.

4
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,270
This is the dress. Do you like it?

5
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:30,480
We've got to hurry. Everyone's going.
There's only two left in my size.

6
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,440
Come on, Dad, let's go.

7
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,200
When do I meet him?

8
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,790
His name's Chappy.

9
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:48,870
On the football team and very...

10
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,920
- Chubby?
- Chappy.

11
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,460
You'll meet when he picks me up
for the dance.

12
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,050
Not before?

13
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:57,300
Dad, you really need to go faster.

14
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,260
Will he drive you to the dance?

15
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,140
He's rented a limo.

16
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,430
So he won't drive you?

17
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:09,480
Limos come with drivers. So stop worrying.

18
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,610
It's a nice dress. You'll be very pretty.

19
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,450
I want you to like it.

20
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,260
- I'm getting out.
- No, no, no. Wait until I park.

21
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,770
Everyone's already inside.

22
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,690
Fan, careful crossing the street!

23
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,100
You stupid...

24
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,170
Metro desk, Ian Wood.

25
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,880
Listen carefully.

26
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,630
An action wing of the Authentic IRA

27
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:45,680
has just exploded a bomb
at the OBT Bank in Knightsbridge.

28
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,300
The code word is "Phoenix."

29
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:51,180
Britain's banks are now targets
for the Authentic IRA.

30
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:55,140
The bombings will continue as long as
Britain's financial criminal institutions

31
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:58,650
persist in their support of the illegal
occupation of Northern Ireland.

32
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,570
A bomb just went off,
an OBT Bank in Knightsbridge.

33
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:11,330
A group called the Authentic IRA just
phoned it in. They're claiming credit.

34
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:12,740
Who's the Authentic IRA?

35
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,080
No idea. Never heard of them.

36
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:19,080
Christ. There goes the Peace Accord
right back in the shit.

37
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,960
Listen up. A bank has just
been bombed in Knightsbridge.

38
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,720
A group calling itself
the Authentic IRA just phoned it in.

39
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,800
I want to know who they are,
who's behind them.

40
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,800
Call the Met, Sinn Fein,
monitor the blogs.

41
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:34,020
Is it the IRA or is it something else?
ISIS? Al-Qaeda?

42
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,100
What are you waiting for? Get over there.

43
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,320
...have asked
a number of police officials

44
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:53,240
for current estimates
on the dead and wounded...

45
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,340
This is a major incident
that they're treating

46
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,550
as a possible terrorist attack.

47
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,840
The bomb went off at exactly...

48
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:54,010
...4:15 GMT in Knightsbridge.

49
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,180
One theory on the cause of the blast

50
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:59,060
was that it may have been
a gasoline explosion underground.

51
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,060
How many? How many I get?

52
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:05,480
Twelve dead so far,
three times as many injured.

53
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:08,860
The explosion was centered
at the OBT Bank Branch in Knightsbridge.

54
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,650
There was no warning and police
were taken completely by surprise.

55
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,570
Fuck warnings. That'll teach 'em.

56
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,120
Any problems?

57
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:23,000
- No.
- We should be moving.

58
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,460
That's normal procedure.

59
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:28,210
Every cop, hotel, and landlady in London
is now looking for the Irishman.

60
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:32,970
This place is safe,
so long as we stay put.

61
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:55,740
Could I go to jail
if I murdered your phone?

62
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:02,330
Destruction of government property?
Absolutely.

63
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:06,000
Too bad. What's the time?

64
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,920
Almost 10:00. Ten more minutes.

65
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,630
Um, I'll miss my flight.

66
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:17,890
Let's stay here,
door locked, blinds down...

67
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,260
Room service for a week.

68
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,520
Sound good?

69
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,640
And your work, Deputy Minister?

70
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,020
An acute case of food poisoning.

71
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,070
You need to work on your excuses, darling.

72
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,510
Jesus Christ.

73
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,180
There's been an IRA bombing in London.

74
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,890
Scores dead and injured.

75
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,070
- Yes?
- Jesus, Liam.

76
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:17,530
Half the world's trying to find you.
Do you even know what's happened?

77
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:18,860
Yes, yes, yes, I heard.

78
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:21,280
I've been trying you for hours.
Where've you been?

79
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,080
Meetings.

80
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,160
- Meetings?
- Aye.

81
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:28,000
And last night?

82
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,710
You didn't come home. I was worried.

83
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:36,170
Came in late, left early.
Lot of work to catch up on.

84
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,890
But the guest room wasn't slept in.

85
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,510
Who said I slept?

86
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,760
Oh, cut the crap, Liam.

87
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,890
You didn't come home, plain and simple.

88
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:46,480
And what if I didn't!

89
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,980
Look, I've got a lot to deal with, OK?

90
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,320
So, don't wait up, and don't be worried.

91
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:57,530
Sunday is the 20th anniversary
of my brother's death.

92
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,990
Saint Mary's is dedicating
a mass to him, so...

93
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:04,950
I'll have Beth put it in the calendar, OK?
We'll talk later.

94
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:07,870
Oh, Jesus.

95
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:43,180
Yes, I understand
the need for swift action.

96
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,300
But until we can identify the threat,
there's not much we can do.

97
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,220
Well, you have your finger
on the pulse over there, Liam.

98
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,520
We're depending on you.

99
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,980
Anything you can provide, anything at all,
would be a tremendous help.

100
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,690
I'm meeting the Council now.

101
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,610
I'll shake the trees as hard
as I can and see what falls.

102
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,730
But, Kate, this is crucial.

103
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,360
We've managed to keep the lid on this
for 19 years now.

104
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:07,700
But there are new upstarts in the ranks
pressing for the way things were.

105
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,080
I could use something now.

106
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,830
And you know what I'm referring to.

107
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,460
The Royal Pardons.

108
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,090
I remember your list, the 40 "On-the-Runs."
Are we really back to that?

109
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:21,340
My cousin's on that list.

110
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:24,550
He hasn't even been convicted
of any paramilitary offenses.

111
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:28,260
These people are suspects
in many things, including murder.

112
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:31,640
These people are critical
to holding the peace together now.

113
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,810
A few letters of pardon
would be a small gesture.

114
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,110
We keep it quiet.

115
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,520
But knowing it's been considered,
gives me leeway

116
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:43,190
to press certain men
for something in return.

117
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,740
As Irish Deputy Minister,

118
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,660
you have served the British
government honorably,

119
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,370
which hasn't always been easy.

120
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:51,660
But appeasement is a dangerous thing.

121
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,000
These are longstanding issues.

122
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,960
That if addressed now
would smack of appeasement.

123
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,580
I need something, Kate.

124
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:01,000
The newer members haven't
lived the bloodshed and are easily swayed.

125
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,210
I'm trying to hold this together.

126
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,930
A gesture is all.
It would make a difference.

127
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,840
I'll consider it.

128
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:14,480
But I want something first,
something real.

129
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:16,850
Understood.

130
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,300
Hello?

131
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:53,510
We're closed. We open at 12:00.

132
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,430
Uh, we're looking for the owner,
a Mr. Quin Minh?

133
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,770
Quan.

134
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,400
Upstairs.

135
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,780
They were found on site,
not far from your daughter's body.

136
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,610
Can you positively identify them as hers?

137
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:12,660
Who did this?

138
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,290
As of now, sir, we don't know,
but we're going to find out.

139
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,330
Why my daughter?

140
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,420
Is there someone we can call

141
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,340
to come and be with you, Mr. Quan?

142
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,300
I have no more family.

143
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:40,850
These bombers, will you catch them?

144
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:41,770
Yes.

145
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,940
Will they get punished?

146
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,780
Yes, they certainly will.

147
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,530
We'll let ourselves out.

148
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,130
Ah, good morning, Hugh. Thanks for coming.

149
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:10,300
Been a long time, Liam.

150
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,090
It's been a long time, indeed.
Go on, take a chair, there.

151
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,850
All right, Hugh?

152
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,970
Now that we're all here,

153
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,810
does anyone know
who this Authentic IRA is?

154
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:24,650
Are they even part of the IRA?

155
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:30,240
Some new upstarts
or something else entirely? Hmm?

156
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,200
They're trying to undermine everything
we've achieved over the last 19 years.

157
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,620
Well, I won't have it.

158
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:40,580
They don't have the support of the people
who said no to the violence.

159
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,120
Our mandate's to uphold that choice

160
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,420
and maintain the Peace Accord
no matter what.

161
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,590
Are we in agreement?

162
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:49,460
There's a lot of support for their actions
amongst the younger ranks.

163
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,760
Hotheads.

164
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:54,220
Hotheads who don't remember
or know any better.

165
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,640
You were once one of those hotheads, Liam.

166
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:57,970
Aye.

167
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,520
Long ago, when it was the only way.

168
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,890
And what did it give us?

169
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,600
More graves than I care to remember.

170
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:08,190
This bombing rivals Omagh
with its civilian deaths.

171
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:12,110
It's unacceptable, anytime, anywhere!

172
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:14,360
And do you think the bombers
come from our ranks?

173
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,490
The Brits ID'd the explosive.

174
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,240
Czech-made Semtex from our dumps.

175
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:23,120
They also used our code word.

176
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,040
Which means they have
a contact in our command.

177
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,500
Maybe someone in this room.

178
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,760
They're trying to divide us,

179
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,390
put the Brits back on the streets again,
stir up the troubles all over again.

180
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:39,760
Well, I won't have it!

181
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:43,270
I want a complete check
of all the arms dumps here and abroad,

182
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,640
everything verified,

183
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:47,270
guns, Semtex, the whole fuckin' lot.

184
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:50,360
- Jesus, you can't be serious.
- Never been more so, Patty.

185
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:52,820
We check 'em, and if something's missing,

186
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,400
we trace it back
to those who knew the location.

187
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,990
And then we deal with this internally.

188
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,620
Unless someone here's got a better idea.

189
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,330
What do we get in return?

190
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,870
Peace.

191
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,130
Is that so bad, Brennan?

192
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,420
Haven't you paid enough in family blood?

193
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:15,800
So, unless you all
want to trash what we have,

194
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,640
I need your full support and respect.

195
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,600
I want a complete list
of all the stocks within the week,

196
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,730
along with their locations,
and everyone who knows where they are.

197
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,810
And no fuckin' exceptions!

198
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,370
Show me.

199
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:45,580
We backtracked 47 minutes.
Clearly anticipated the CCTV.

200
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,210
He circled London for quite some time
prior to the bombing.

201
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:50,290
Now, this is the first
CC feed we have on him.

202
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:54,300
Heading southbound on the A413
near Wendover at 10:53 a.m.

203
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,420
We retrieved the serial number
from the bike's frame.

204
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:00,220
It was reported stolen
in Reading the night before.

205
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,470
The license plates were also stolen
from another bike in Reading.

206
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,180
What about phone calls?

207
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:07,430
Assuming that the bomb
was phone-activated,

208
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,850
we've dumped the five closest towers
to the blast zone

209
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,400
trying to ID any call terminating

210
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:12,650
at the time of the incident.

211
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:13,860
Sorry. Excuse me.

212
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,190
Yup.

213
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:17,990
For you.

214
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:20,530
- Bromley.
- He's here again, sir.

215
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,830
- The Chinese man.
- What?

216
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:25,700
The Chinaman.
It's five days in a row, now.

217
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,790
Christ. Tell him I'm busy.

218
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:30,580
I did, and he said he'd wait, again.

219
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:36,130
I assure you, this investigation
is our top priority, Mr. Quan.

220
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:39,590
And we're doing all we can
and pursuing every possible lead

221
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,930
to find those who killed your daughter.

222
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:48,430
But they're a difficult people to catch.

223
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,730
And it may take some time.

224
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,190
I need you to understand that.

225
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:55,860
You must catch these men,
Commander Bromley.

226
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,570
Again, it's our top priority.

227
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,450
Twenty thousand pound.

228
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:12,750
All I have for the names of the bombers.

229
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,460
- I'm sorry, but we can't take this.
- Then please tell me...

230
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:22,050
Just give me the name
of someone in the IRA.

231
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:26,600
To be clear, these are vicious men
who take pride in their atrocities.

232
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:30,730
Any attempt by you to contact them
is likely to end very badly.

233
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:33,100
This is our work, not yours.

234
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,480
You need to be patient.

235
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,160
How long have you been
in this country, Mr. Quan?

236
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:49,040
Since 1984. I'm a British citizen.

237
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,910
You were born in Guangxi, China.

238
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,840
Yes. I'm Chinese Nung.

239
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,300
I work in Saigon after the war.

240
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,880
We escaped to Singapore.

241
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,590
Then we immigrate here.

242
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,850
You had two daughters
before Fan.

243
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,850
Both killed during the escape.

244
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,850
And your wife?

245
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,390
Where is she now?

246
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,440
She died, giving birth to Fan.

247
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,570
I'm truly sorry for your loss.

248
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,040
But you mustn't keep coming here
on a daily basis.

249
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:35,290
It doesn't help, and diverts time
and resources from our investigation.

250
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,340
Do you understand?

251
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,630
Yes. I understand.

252
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,850
Thank you for seeing me,
Commander Bromley.

253
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:05,240
After three weeks
of investigations,

254
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,120
there's little in the way
of solid leads that I'm aware of.

255
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,370
The public is looking for reassurance.

256
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:14,160
One leading politician
who somberly may have answers,

257
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:17,170
lies uncomfortably
at the center of this storm.

258
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,840
We go now to an interview
I recorded earlier in Belfast

259
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,710
with Deputy Minister Liam Hennessy.

260
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,590
Deputy Minister Hennessy,

261
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:26,630
you've publicly condemned the bombings.

262
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,550
Yet, as a former leader of Sinn Fein

263
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,220
and a member of the IRA,

264
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,850
you took part in similar events years ago.

265
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:37,230
What's the essential difference between
those acts you were involved in then

266
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:39,400
and what's happened in London recently?

267
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,280
Hope. We had none,
just years of vengeance.

268
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,490
We needed to break the cycle,

269
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:49,700
so we committed
to a political path which lead to...

270
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,950
I've made you tea.

271
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:53,950
So, if you say "hope,"

272
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,370
why are these IRA men,
who come from your own ranks,

273
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,370
returning to the bombings?

274
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:04,000
I can say with reasonable certainty
that the IRA are not behind this.

275
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:07,340
They stand firmly behind
the agreement and the promises...

276
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,130
You can't be like this anymore.

277
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,760
You should eat something.

278
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:14,390
I'm getting you some noodles.

279
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:20,350
So, you're saying
possibly it's a financial problem

280
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,940
rather than a political one.

281
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:25,980
People look for scapegoats, for a way out.

282
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:28,030
And for some, they are more than happy

283
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:31,320
to resort to violence,
to upset the status quo.

284
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:42,500
Prepared for your signature.
They absolutely must be signed now.

285
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,130
What's the latest reaction
on social media?

286
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:47,590
Same as before. Fear and anger.

287
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,010
Anger directed at whom?

288
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:51,130
From the Prime Minister on down.

289
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,930
CNN and The Irish Times
want interviews with you.

290
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,010
You can do tonight
or tomorrow morning at 8:00.

291
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,310
Tomorrow morning by phone. What else?

292
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:00,480
You've a call waitin' on Line Two.

293
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,810
- Waiting?
- For 30 minutes now.

294
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,770
A Mr. Quan from London, very insistent.

295
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:09,070
- What does he want?
- His daughter was killed in the bombing.

296
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:12,240
I tried my best to console him,
but he really just wants to speak to you.

297
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,330
- He saw ya on TV.
- Oh, Christ, Beth.

298
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:17,790
Civic duty. Take it and be done.

299
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:25,840
This is Liam Hennessy. How may I help you?

300
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:29,260
Mr. Hennessy,
tell me who killed my daughter?

301
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:32,720
What on Earth makes you think
I know who killed your daughter?

302
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,850
Because, you are the First Deputy Minister

303
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:39,640
and advisor to Sinn Fein,
and a former IRA member.

304
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:44,350
I am truly sad for your loss, Mr. Quan.
I have a daughter myself.

305
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,440
And I condemn these acts of violence,
but I can't help you.

306
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:49,230
Then please tell me someone

307
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,610
who might know the names of the bombers,
someone I can talk to.

308
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:56,990
I don't have any connections
to those sorts of people. I'm sorry.

309
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,160
I don't believe you, Mr. Hennessy.

310
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,250
You are very powerful man.

311
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:04,670
Well, I work for the government
and our elected officials.

312
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,670
I do not work for terrorists.

313
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:11,460
IRA politics and terrorism
are different ends of the same snake.

314
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:14,340
Whichever end you grab,
you still grab a snake.

315
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:17,050
It makes a great deal
of difference which end you grab,

316
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,850
because one end will bite.

317
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,560
Again, I'm sorry for your loss, Mr. Quan.

318
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,640
Good day.

319
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,320
What are you doing?

320
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,160
You have to stop this.

321
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,330
This wasn't your fault.

322
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,590
I failed them.

323
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,720
What's this?

324
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:40,850
The restaurant is now yours.

325
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:44,720
You've been a good friend to me, Lam.

326
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:47,640
No more of this talk.

327
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,060
Look at me.

328
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:57,240
I'm not going home. I'm staying the night.
I will sleep on the couch.

329
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:59,860
And on Monday,
I'm taking you to see someone.

330
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:02,910
Someone to help you.
But no more of this talk. OK?

331
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:10,790
Quan!

332
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:21,030
I've been calling you
all night. Where were you?

333
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,860
What are you going to do?

334
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,120
When will you come back?

335
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,940
You have a room?

336
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:41,110
These are important documents
that we must have today.

337
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,780
Yes, I will keep trying
the sender because,

338
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,610
apparently there's nothing else I can do,
which I find strange

339
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,240
and certainly not the service
I've come to expect.

340
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:54,460
Yes, 329174-N for November.

341
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,960
You tell your supervisor
I'll be calling back.

342
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:59,170
Good day.

343
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:02,170
Yes? May I help you?

344
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:04,970
Please, I would like to
speak to Mr. Hennessy.

345
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:07,340
- And your name?
- Ngoc Minh Quan.

346
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,470
You're the one who's been phoning.

347
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:11,560
Yes. I phoned many times.

348
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,270
I'm afraid the Deputy Minister is busy
and won't be able to see you.

349
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:19,110
- I will wait.
- No, you must leave.

350
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:21,360
Best do as the lady says.

351
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:24,280
He's been phoning up
at all hours asking for Liam.

352
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,280
He won't take no for an answer.

353
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,400
Just groceries.

354
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:31,280
Go now, before we make ya.

355
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,290
- No. I'm wait.
- Right.

356
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,210
It's the man who's been
phoning you from London.

357
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:47,180
He's got a knife on him.
One of those Swiss Army types.

358
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:50,390
Well, take it off him.

359
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,850
Jesus, how much damage
can he do with you two around?

360
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,270
Let him be.

361
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,600
As I explained before...

362
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:59,770
...I don't know who the bombers are.

363
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:02,690
I realize you're angry,
but there's not much I can do.

364
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:05,320
It's also very dangerous
for you to be here.

365
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,990
People in Belfast
won't take kindly to your accusations.

366
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,490
If you do not know who they are,

367
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,290
I would like you to please find out.

368
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:23,840
I haven't been affiliated
with the IRA for 30 years.

369
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:27,050
When I was,
I fought hard against the violence.

370
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:29,340
I went to prison
for what I did and paid my debt.

371
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:32,890
Now I serve the politics of both sides,

372
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:35,390
trying to heal the wounds
and bridge the divide.

373
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:42,150
Again, my sincere condolences,
but there's nothing I can do.

374
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,900
What if your wife and daughter
were killed by bomb?

375
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:51,280
I'd do everything in my power
to get justice.

376
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:55,030
So, I've chosen you, Mr. Hennessy.

377
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,950
You will tell me who killed my child.

378
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:01,370
Again, I don't know.

379
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,550
You will change your mind.

380
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:13,050
Thank you for seeing me,
First Minister Hennessy.

381
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:30,670
I'm sorry, Liam. He took me by surprise.

382
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:43,140
You're OK, Beth. OK, you're OK.

383
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:44,940
Take her, take her.

384
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:47,610
- Murphy, have the boys check the building.
- Right.

385
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:48,980
Jesus.

386
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:03,660
Would you like a whiskey, Inspector?

387
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,920
No, thank you.

388
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:12,590
I suppose it would be a waste of time
asking who might've done this.

389
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:15,720
No one comes to mind.

390
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:20,720
Well, it appears to have been
nothing more than a warning.

391
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,060
Fortunately, it wasn't a serious bomb.

392
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:26,100
If it had been, we wouldn't
be here talking, would we?

393
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:31,860
Feel free to reach out,
should you have the unexpected urge.

394
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:35,650
I'll feed the press a gas leak story
in the meantime.

395
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,950
Fair enough. Thanks very much, Inspector.

396
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,700
Hello?

397
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,500
It's him.

398
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:55,470
You come to my office
and plant a fucking bomb?

399
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,930
- Have you changed your mind?
- Changed my mind?

400
00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:00,090
Are you out of your fuckin' tree?

401
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,310
You have no idea who you're dealing with.

402
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:03,600
But you'll soon find out.

403
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,850
Give me the names.

404
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:07,480
I'll tell you what.
Let's meet face-to-face.

405
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,390
We'll settle...

406
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,900
The fuckin' wanker
threatened me and hung up.

407
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:18,820
Right. Let's check all the hotels
and guest houses.

408
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:20,360
He won't be hard to find.

409
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:23,990
Fuckin' Chinaman.

410
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:30,000
Uncle Liam? What's up?

411
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:36,260
I'll be there.

412
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:50,370
Stop! Hold it, hold it,
hold it! Don't move!

413
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:53,670
Don't move! She's wired to blow!

414
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,290
Two sets of wires
ten-foot long,

415
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:37,080
soldered to that light bulb
and covered with ground-up match heads.

416
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,710
Gives an extra kick.

417
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:42,170
Not needed, but a nice touch.

418
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:44,800
Crude, effective, and easy to spot.

419
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,470
So, he wanted us to see it.

420
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,760
Well, it wasn't in the tank,
so it wouldn't have worked.

421
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,020
He just wants you to know
he can get to ya.

422
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,560
Micky.

423
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,940
We found him.
A B&amp;B in Wellington Park.

424
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:01,400
- They found him.
- Grab him.

425
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:04,780
Drag him out of Belfast.
Discourage him from returning.

426
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,570
Wait for me. I'm on my way.

427
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:10,240
Hello.

428
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:12,540
I hear your office was bombed.

429
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:16,000
Hardly.
It was the toilet in the hall.

430
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:18,750
An Asian man in his 60s with a grudge.

431
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,250
It's all being taken care of.

432
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,460
Why'd he do it?

433
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:25,130
His child died in the bank bombing.
He thinks I know who did it.

434
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:27,090
He's not the only one of that mind.

435
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:30,890
- So, where are we with the pardons?
- Lots of resistance.

436
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:34,520
But, if you give us something useful,
things might turn in your favor.

437
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,350
I may have a lead. I'm pursuing it.

438
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:41,940
Well, let's hope it bears fruit.
People here want heads.

439
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,740
The dogs won't stay leashed much longer.

440
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,000
Top floor on the right.

441
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,540
Fuckin' get him!

442
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,200
Christ Almighty,
are you dumb and blind?

443
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:37,660
An old man making fools
out of the lot of you

444
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:40,450
and he's still running around
out there, for God's sake.

445
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,790
You are four men. Four.

446
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:44,830
We had him cornered,
then he jumped off the roof

447
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,670
and slid down like some fuckin' monkey.

448
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:47,790
What is goin' on?

449
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,010
Pack your bag. You're going to the farm.

450
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:55,430
Go on.

451
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:57,180
Get your things.

452
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:03,560
- You all right, Sean?
- Hi, Christy.

453
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:05,270
Go on through, he's expecting ya.

454
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:12,570
Beat ya up. Come on in
and have a drink, for God's sake.

455
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:14,200
Well, look at ya.

456
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,160
- Jesus, the place looks well.
- It's not bad, is it?

457
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,200
- No.
- You're a sight for sore eyes.

458
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,780
So, how is New York treatin' ya?

459
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:22,950
- Ah, it's cold.
- Uh-huh.

460
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:26,920
Look, Murphy filled me in, there.
That bloody Chinaman.

461
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,460
He set off a bomb in my office,

462
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:32,130
put one in my Jag, and beat the bejesus
out of Mick and Jimmy.

463
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:37,800
- Do you want me to handle him?
- No. That's Kavanagh's problem.

464
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,600
I need your help with the London bombing.

465
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:45,980
Any idea who's behind it yet?

466
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:49,270
Not at all.

467
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,570
- Well, the Yanks aren't happy, Liam.
- Mm...

468
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:54,280
Dead women and kids
all over the news.

469
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,900
Any fundraising now is impossible.

470
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:58,820
Yeah, this is not about fundraising, Sean.

471
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:01,160
I need you to go to London
and meet someone...

472
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,750
A Richard Bromley in SO15.

473
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,170
SO15?

474
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:10,500
He needs to know the bombings aren't ours,

475
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:13,710
and that we're working the problem hard,
but we need his help.

476
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,800
Why me?

477
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,720
You're a decorated Ranger
in the Royal Irish Regiment.

478
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:22,260
Bromley will respect you as much
as he's capable of respecting any of us.

479
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:26,680
Should anyone find out
that we're talking to the Brits,

480
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:29,850
to go after one of our own, rogue or not,

481
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,020
there'll be the devil to pay.

482
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:35,780
So, can I count on you, Sean...

483
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,030
to be discreet?

484
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:40,820
Of course.

485
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:28,200
Right this way, sir.

486
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:29,290
Thank you very much.

487
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:41,720
You took your time.

488
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,680
I just had to put out
the odd fire here and there.

489
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:53,940
I'll be back in a minute.

490
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:55,020
I'll be right here.

491
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:09,870
Jesus.

492
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,440
Mr. Morrison.

493
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,660
Commander Bromley.

494
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:49,160
- We're not responsible.
- Really?

495
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:52,160
Forensic evidence and the use
of your code word suggests otherwise.

496
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:54,960
It's a renegade unit.
We don't know who they are yet.

497
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,880
You're telling me
there's an active IRA unit

498
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,210
on the loose you know nothing about?

499
00:44:58,290 --> 00:44:59,250
Yes, I am.

500
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:00,880
And the Semtex?

501
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:02,630
They're raiding our dumps.

502
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:04,760
Dumps that were
all given up for the Accord?

503
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:06,800
And your code word?

504
00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:09,850
They're being helped by someone
in our command, Belfast or Dublin.

505
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:11,470
So, what do you want, Mr. Morrison?

506
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:13,770
We've a plan.

507
00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:16,270
Different codes will be given
to each member of command.

508
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,230
When the bombers claim credit
for the next attack,

509
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:20,150
you'll tell us which word they use.

510
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:22,360
Then we'll know who gave
the orders and then we end it.

511
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,030
Who else is involved in this plan?

512
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,570
Liam Hennessy.

513
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:28,120
So, you can appreciate
the need for discretion.

514
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,910
Only Liam knows
who will be given which word.

515
00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:32,830
So, Hennessy will personally work with us
to take out an IRA cell?

516
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:35,160
- A rogue cell.
- Your people, nonetheless.

517
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:39,040
I've one condition.

518
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:43,710
When Hennessy finds the bombers,
he tells me directly.

519
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:46,550
Then we take them down. Not you.

520
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,260
This is non-negotiable.

521
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,620
We found some plastic bags in his room.

522
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:18,920
Based on what I saw,
he's brewed up some nitroglycerin,

523
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,290
mixed it with weed killer, packed it
into some plastic plumbing pipes.

524
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:24,130
How much damage can he do?

525
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:27,630
I'm guessing he's made four bombs,
each enough to blow up a lorry.

526
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:28,720
Jesus.

527
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,760
Knows what he's doing.
I've half the city looking for him.

528
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:34,390
When he surfaces in Belfast,
we'll find him.

529
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:36,560
You'll be safe here.

530
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:41,100
Aye. I wouldn't count on it.

531
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:49,440
Benny!

532
00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:03,810
Jesus Christ!

533
00:50:05,890 --> 00:50:07,520
Move it! Move it!

534
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:23,740
Jesus. He roughed up Benny and Sean.
They'll be fine.

535
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,160
Get more men from Belfast.

536
00:50:26,410 --> 00:50:29,710
I've underestimated him.
It won't happen again.

537
00:50:42,850 --> 00:50:44,180
It's another warning, Liam?

538
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:47,100
Aye. Nothing I can't handle.

539
00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:49,600
First Belfast, now here.

540
00:50:49,690 --> 00:50:51,560
How in God's name
are you handling anything?

541
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:53,360
The problem's being dealt with.

542
00:50:54,110 --> 00:50:56,230
He is destroying our farmhouse,

543
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:59,280
intent on God knows what,
and you're calling it a problem?

544
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:02,490
God, you can be so pompous sometimes.

545
00:51:02,570 --> 00:51:05,120
I'm leaving for London.
Gonna stay at Keri's.

546
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,580
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

547
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:09,080
Well, I wasn't asking for your permission.

548
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:12,080
He's hardly likely to know
about our daughter's flat, and besides,

549
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:13,590
it's you he's after, not me.

550
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:15,550
Well, the point is,
if he knows about the farmhouse,

551
00:51:15,630 --> 00:51:18,260
I assume he knows about Keri's flat.

552
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:19,510
It's not worth the risk.

553
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:21,970
Well then, you're just gonna
have to handle it, like you said.

554
00:51:23,970 --> 00:51:27,600
I remember a time when you would've
dealt with this, properly,

555
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,100
and other things, too.

556
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:31,600
But those days are gone.

557
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:06,470
Weighs a bit more,
but shouldn't be noticeable.

558
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:10,600
All I'm adding is the Semtex,
a micro-chip and a few inches of wire.

559
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,440
It looks good.

560
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:16,360
Tricky part will be getting it through
the scanner, but, we'll find a way.

561
00:52:16,690 --> 00:52:17,820
And if it's turned on?

562
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:21,280
Shorter battery life,
but it'll work, no problem.

563
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:22,610
Any idea which plane yet?

564
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:26,280
No. We don't want to hit a flight
with any Irish on board.

565
00:52:26,530 --> 00:52:29,910
One in the queen's fleet'd be best.
We just need the right mule.

566
00:52:34,290 --> 00:52:35,920
Code word has changed...

567
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,250
As of tonight.

568
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:43,340
My news editor's a complete twat.

569
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:47,100
Spends as much on a pair of shoes as I get
for eight hours writing crap like this.

570
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:48,180
Makes perfect sense.

571
00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:51,310
Who doesn't like a new pair of sexy shoes?

572
00:52:51,810 --> 00:52:55,350
You should try a real whiskey.
Two Jamesons, single malt.

573
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:01,440
"Wife Attacks
Husband's Transgender Lover."

574
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:03,360
Some serious news you're writing there.

575
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:06,910
Well, if it pays, I'll write it.

576
00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:08,450
Beats being knee-deep
in a bloody bomb site.

577
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:12,290
- So, what do you do?
- Wealth management.

578
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:22,840
I'm Maggie.

579
00:53:23,050 --> 00:53:24,170
Ian.

580
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:31,010
All right.
I'll call if we need more.

581
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:32,680
- Thanks, Mary.
- All right, thanks. Bye.

582
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:37,350
Six more men
are on their way from Belfast.

583
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,560
When they get here, they'll relieve
the fellas who've been up all night.

584
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:40,730
Is it enough to secure the farm?

585
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:44,240
Secure as it can be.
It's 20 total working two shifts.

586
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:48,240
All right. You're flying
to London today with Mary.

587
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,910
- Right, yeah.
- That's completely unnecessary.

588
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:52,580
Get her into Keri's flat,
then move them into a hotel.

589
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:54,080
I can manage this, all right?

590
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,660
I'll not be debating this!

591
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:58,290
Nick's gonna fill up the Jag.

592
00:53:58,380 --> 00:53:59,830
You're leaving...

593
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:19,520
Take him to the hospital.

594
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:22,360
- Get Mary to the airport. Go.
- Right.

595
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:31,370
Buried nitro bomb, detonated by remote.

596
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:34,660
He needed a line of sight.

597
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:37,620
Those woods, that's where I'd be.

598
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:41,500
- Go.
- Sean! Mick! Get in the car.

599
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:42,750
Go, go, go!

600
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:05,530
Come on. Go, go, go!

601
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:15,160
You guys spread out.
I'll take the high ground.

602
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:07,550
Names!

603
00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:36,530
Jesus Christ!

604
00:56:36,950 --> 00:56:39,410
One ol' man running circles
around the lot of us.

605
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:41,620
Why is it so hard?

606
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:44,580
He's ahead of us every step of the way.

607
00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:46,500
We need more men.

608
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,800
We need 100 more men, at least.

609
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:51,710
And if we did that,
we'd have the whole of Belfast against us.

610
00:56:54,470 --> 00:56:57,510
Bring in a tracker,
someone who knows the woods,

611
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,010
and beat him at his own game.

612
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:01,770
My nephew?

613
00:57:01,850 --> 00:57:04,480
Aye. If you can spare him.

614
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:34,970
Come on.

615
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:44,810
How's Keri? Where is she?

616
00:57:44,890 --> 00:57:45,890
Out.

617
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:49,020
You're a wee bit early,
but I'm nearly ready.

618
00:57:49,690 --> 00:57:51,900
Have you a restaurant in mind?

619
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:53,690
Haven't given it much thought.

620
00:57:55,950 --> 00:57:59,030
So, what urgencies
bring my nephew all the way to London?

621
00:58:00,490 --> 00:58:01,620
A few personal matters.

622
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:04,750
I'm glad I made the list.

623
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:09,750
Mm. I think that works.

624
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:11,710
What do you think?

625
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:38,700
You've gotta be kiddin'.

626
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:46,910
- Liam?
- Tell Bromley I'll accept his terms.

627
00:58:47,410 --> 00:58:48,540
I'll pass it on.

628
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:51,170
I've given out the code words.
Now we wait.

629
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,670
Quan hit us again.

630
00:58:55,630 --> 00:58:57,920
Blew up the Jag,
put Billy in the hospital.

631
00:58:58,170 --> 00:58:59,800
Kavanagh and the boys went after him.

632
00:59:00,050 --> 00:59:04,180
The wee shitey injured three more men.
Punji sticks, if you can believe that.

633
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:07,520
Liam, it sounds like he's trained.
Maybe Special Forces.

634
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,020
Which brings me to the point.

635
00:59:09,230 --> 00:59:12,810
I need a tracker, Sean.
Can you give us a hand?

636
00:59:13,690 --> 00:59:15,940
- I'll take a morning flight.
- Good man.

637
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:28,450
Hey. How'd he sound?

638
00:59:30,210 --> 00:59:31,290
Worried.

639
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,090
He's got a lot going on.

640
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:36,340
Well, if he doesn't
find the bombers, the Accord's dead.

641
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:38,460
And politically, so's he.

642
00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:42,510
Do you think he'll find them?

643
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:45,050
Yeah, if there's another blast.

644
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:49,310
The code word will lead us to
who's running them.

645
00:59:49,390 --> 00:59:51,980
He's finished.
The code word won't save him.

646
00:59:53,230 --> 00:59:55,480
What the Council needs is new blood...

647
00:59:56,190 --> 00:59:58,400
someone stronger, like you.

648
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:01,740
He's afraid to use his power.

649
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:05,200
He's just a washed-up old man
trying to hold onto whatever he can.

650
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:13,330
I've never forgiven him
for my brother Patrick.

651
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:16,380
Liam found out who killed him.

652
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:21,670
A UVF death squad. Four men.

653
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:27,510
I told Liam to kill them
before they got to court.

654
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,100
But he said no.

655
01:00:29,970 --> 01:00:32,310
That the time for revenge is past.

656
01:00:33,850 --> 01:00:36,900
So, my Patrick is dead and buried,

657
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:40,190
and they're sitting in jail now,
all four of them,

658
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:42,490
taking classes at the open university.

659
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:47,910
It's not right. It's not.

660
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:29,030
Hugh McGrath's here.

661
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:38,080
I heard you're checking my dumps.

662
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:41,210
We're checking everyone's. No exceptions.

663
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:43,880
Four came up short. Two were yours.

664
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:46,000
Ten kilos of Semtex missing.

665
01:03:46,090 --> 01:03:49,630
What in God's name are you doing?
My dumps were off-limits.

666
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:51,010
We were clear in that. Remember?

667
01:03:51,090 --> 01:03:52,340
You were at the meeting.

668
01:03:52,890 --> 01:03:54,850
If you knew they were short,
you should've handled it.

669
01:03:54,930 --> 01:03:58,520
They were in perfect order.
I checked 'em myself, and that's a fact.

670
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:04,440
Christ, Liam, so the committee
knows it's my Semtex?

671
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:11,990
Don't know who we can
trust anymore. Do we?

672
01:04:12,490 --> 01:04:13,990
Trust, or fear?

673
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:17,290
In your case, mostly fear.

674
01:04:17,740 --> 01:04:19,700
Simple and brutal, like my da taught me.

675
01:04:21,710 --> 01:04:25,630
Look, we have an opportunity here, Liam,
if you take the lead.

676
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:27,250
This Chinaman isn't helping matters,

677
01:04:27,340 --> 01:04:28,840
but let me get some locals
to hunt him down.

678
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:30,840
- How much do you know?
- Plenty.

679
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:33,380
Bomb in your office. Your farm. Your car.

680
01:04:33,470 --> 01:04:36,430
Mary and your daughter hiding out
in a London hotel, a bloody mess, it is.

681
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:39,850
And the men sense weakness, as do the UVF.

682
01:04:39,930 --> 01:04:43,600
You should be back in Belfast,
out in front, taking charge.

683
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:46,650
- Look, I'm no politician...
- What're you trying to say?

684
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:48,770
The bombing.

685
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:53,700
A few quiet words of encouragement
would soothe the ranks.

686
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:55,200
"Encouragement"?

687
01:04:55,410 --> 01:04:56,950
They kill civilians by the buckets.

688
01:04:57,030 --> 01:05:01,250
They went a bit far, I know,
but they have given us real momentum.

689
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:02,710
The Brits are on the ropes.

690
01:05:02,790 --> 01:05:06,830
Jesus Christ, I said hit a few
financial targets. That's it.

691
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:09,500
No one gets hurt.
That's what we agreed to.

692
01:05:09,590 --> 01:05:12,630
- You gave me your word.
- And by God, I kept it.

693
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:16,300
I don't know who they are,
don't even know who's controlling 'em.

694
01:05:16,390 --> 01:05:17,680
And that's the way it has to be.

695
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:20,810
Because, if something goes wrong,
they could trace 'em straight back to us.

696
01:05:20,890 --> 01:05:24,980
Go wrong? This wasn't the fuckin' plan.
I needed this to get our people back.

697
01:05:25,190 --> 01:05:29,650
- You and I have spent our whole lifetime...
- You don't give a shit about those men.

698
01:05:29,730 --> 01:05:31,940
You needed the bombing
to shore up the election,

699
01:05:32,030 --> 01:05:33,900
to prop up your weakness in the ranks.

700
01:05:33,990 --> 01:05:38,870
Well, guess what?
In the fog o' war, plans fuckin' change.

701
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:44,080
Now, I stood by you
when you put fire into the lads.

702
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:47,290
M62, Aldershot, Mountbatten.

703
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:49,590
You were calling for an escalation then,
right enough.

704
01:05:49,670 --> 01:05:51,920
Those days are long gone!

705
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:55,470
That's not what I heard a few months ago.

706
01:05:56,590 --> 01:06:01,390
I heard the old Liam,
a man back on track with a plan.

707
01:06:03,930 --> 01:06:06,730
You haven't forgotten
what we're fighting for, have ya?

708
01:06:07,310 --> 01:06:08,730
You question my loyalty?

709
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:13,780
I buried my brother-in-law,
before that my da and my two cousins.

710
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:17,240
We spilt our fair share of blood
struggling for united Ireland,

711
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:19,370
not profiting off a divided one.

712
01:06:19,450 --> 01:06:22,540
So, don't fucking go asking me again
if I've forgotten what we're fighting for.

713
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:25,040
If there's anyone profiteering
around here, it's you,

714
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:29,630
sitting in your fancy houses,
cozying up to the Brits.

715
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:32,040
You're not the Liam I once knew.

716
01:06:32,130 --> 01:06:33,630
You want the old me, huh?

717
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:36,550
The Butcher of the Bogside,
is that what you want?

718
01:06:36,630 --> 01:06:37,800
Well then, hear this.

719
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:40,050
You reel in those fuckin' cunts
and end it,

720
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:42,810
or by God, I'll bury the lot of yas.

721
01:06:44,770 --> 01:06:47,810
Right. I'm going now.

722
01:06:48,020 --> 01:06:49,850
I'll be at my farm if you need me.

723
01:06:51,020 --> 01:06:53,480
And take care of that Committee issue.

724
01:06:53,570 --> 01:06:57,900
We don't want them jumping to the wrong
conclusion about that Semtex. Do we?

725
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,410
Yeah.

726
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:12,290
Do you or any of the men know
where Mary's staying in London?

727
01:07:12,380 --> 01:07:14,300
No. No one, but Murphy.

728
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:16,840
Hmm. McGrath knows where she's hiding.

729
01:07:17,970 --> 01:07:19,590
I wanna know how.

730
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:41,200
What a day, Charlie.

731
01:07:42,410 --> 01:07:44,780
What a day. Come on now, let's go.

732
01:07:50,290 --> 01:07:51,750
Come on, Charlie, up you get.

733
01:07:52,790 --> 01:07:53,630
Charlie.

734
01:08:25,490 --> 01:08:26,660
You killed my dog?

735
01:08:26,990 --> 01:08:29,200
Dog's fine. Just sleeping.

736
01:08:30,290 --> 01:08:31,370
Sit.

737
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:41,380
I'm wearing a bomb.

738
01:08:42,340 --> 01:08:46,640
Anyone comes in,
I touch it one, then we die.

739
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:47,720
Now, give me the names.

740
01:08:47,810 --> 01:08:51,600
They claim they're the IRA,
but I don't know who they really are.

741
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:54,310
I'm doing everything I can
to find out who's responsible.

742
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:55,650
You're lying! Who killed my daughter?

743
01:08:55,730 --> 01:08:58,400
I'm sorry. I truly don't know yet.

744
01:09:04,990 --> 01:09:07,910
The explosives the bombers use,
it's Semtex-H?

745
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:11,660
Yes. Yes. You know about Semtex?

746
01:09:12,710 --> 01:09:14,170
I know Semtex-H.

747
01:09:14,670 --> 01:09:17,290
During the war,
Czechs make for the Viet Cong.

748
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:18,670
Good for bombs and traps.

749
01:09:18,750 --> 01:09:20,590
- In Vietnam?
- Yes.

750
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:24,090
Many American people died by Semtex-H.

751
01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:27,010
Now, IRA use to kill my daughter.

752
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:29,470
That's ironic.

753
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:34,640
I've read your history.
We both know about war.

754
01:09:34,730 --> 01:09:37,980
We've both tried to put it behind us.
You and me, we're alike.

755
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:43,400
We are nothing alike. You're nothing!
You kill women and children! Names!

756
01:09:43,490 --> 01:09:45,570
To Almighty God, I don't know!

757
01:09:45,650 --> 01:09:48,620
Wait! Wait. I've set a trap for them
when they use the next bomb.

758
01:09:48,780 --> 01:09:51,290
When they claim responsibility
for the next bombing,

759
01:09:51,370 --> 01:09:54,960
they'll use a code word,
telling the police they're IRA.

760
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:57,880
I've changed that code word.

761
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:00,840
So, when they use it, I'll know.

762
01:10:07,890 --> 01:10:09,140
You have one day.

763
01:10:11,510 --> 01:10:13,100
What if they don't set off a bomb by then?

764
01:10:14,890 --> 01:10:16,230
Twenty-four hours.

765
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:23,360
Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus. Sweet Jesus.

766
01:10:26,450 --> 01:10:27,610
We missed it the first time...

767
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:30,450
But ran a reconfiguration through RAPTOR,

768
01:10:30,530 --> 01:10:33,490
and the image's anomalies
and architecture became more apparent.

769
01:10:33,830 --> 01:10:36,660
Now there, look, the back of his hand.

770
01:10:36,750 --> 01:10:39,210
- Hmm.
- Looks like a burn or a birthmark.

771
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:40,830
We're running comparatives now.

772
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:43,670
So, it's a bit more time,
but we'll get it.

773
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:51,220
Come on. Come on.

774
01:11:00,980 --> 01:11:01,900
OK.

775
01:11:01,980 --> 01:11:03,110
There you go.

776
01:12:08,550 --> 01:12:11,380
- Good morning, Sean. Thanks for coming.
- Are you all right?

777
01:12:11,470 --> 01:12:14,220
Well, I've been better.
There's been another bombing.

778
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:16,640
- Yeah, I just heard.
- Aye, a London bus.

779
01:12:16,810 --> 01:12:18,890
- Has Bromley phoned?
- No. Not yet.

780
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:21,560
McGrath's on his way with some locals.
They'll give ya a hand.

781
01:12:21,850 --> 01:12:24,650
No, I don't need them. I'll handle it.

782
01:12:24,730 --> 01:12:25,730
Good man.

783
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:44,920
Hennessy.

784
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:48,590
They called, but didn't give a code word.
What the hell's going on?

785
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:50,510
Maybe it wasn't them.

786
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:52,970
Press Association took the call.

787
01:12:53,050 --> 01:12:55,640
A man with an Irish accent said
there'd be no more fuckin' cooperation

788
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:57,220
with the Brits and no more code words.

789
01:12:57,510 --> 01:13:00,100
He knew exactly which bus
and how much explosive was used.

790
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:02,310
And it's been ID'd as your Semtex again.

791
01:13:02,390 --> 01:13:05,810
Either someone talked,
warned them off, or you're playing me.

792
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:10,940
Only two people knew what was happening...
Myself and Morrison.

793
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:13,320
Like I said, one of you can't be trusted.

794
01:13:13,740 --> 01:13:16,410
Send me a number where
I can reach you day or night.

795
01:13:17,570 --> 01:13:19,870
I'll call the moment I have something.

796
01:13:20,290 --> 01:13:21,700
It better be soon,

797
01:13:21,790 --> 01:13:24,290
or you'll feel a backlash the likes
of which you've never felt before.

798
01:13:29,090 --> 01:13:30,500
A bus now.

799
01:13:30,590 --> 01:13:33,260
For God's sake,
16 dead, twice that injured.

800
01:13:33,340 --> 01:13:34,800
I'm sorry.

801
01:13:35,180 --> 01:13:37,970
I had a plan to nail the bastards.
Didn't work.

802
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:41,010
I've just come
from Downing Street.

803
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:42,980
The PM will consider the pardons,

804
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:45,440
but only if you give up
the bombers immediately.

805
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:47,860
And how in God's name do I do that?

806
01:13:47,940 --> 01:13:49,400
Find a way.

807
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:53,150
Plans are afoot to put the paratroops
back on your streets in 48 hours.

808
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,030
Belfast will erupt.

809
01:13:55,110 --> 01:13:57,570
You'll give the bombers
exactly what they want.

810
01:13:57,660 --> 01:14:00,490
Well, it's out of my hands now.
Call when you have something.

811
01:14:00,870 --> 01:14:02,410
I'm heading for a conference
in Rome tomorrow.

812
01:14:02,490 --> 01:14:04,250
I'll have my cell at all times.

813
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:26,440
How was London? Is Mary OK?

814
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,860
You said to keep an eye on her,

815
01:14:30,270 --> 01:14:32,570
and make sure she and Keri were kept safe.

816
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:40,240
I spent some time in her hotel lobby
watching the comings and goings, you know?

817
01:14:40,620 --> 01:14:42,120
She had no idea I was there.

818
01:14:43,990 --> 01:14:45,410
And your nephew turns up.

819
01:14:47,330 --> 01:14:48,870
He spent two hours in her room.

820
01:14:51,130 --> 01:14:54,380
- He spent two hours in Mary's room?
- Aye.

821
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:55,880
And after he goes,

822
01:14:57,380 --> 01:14:58,840
Mary comes down,

823
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:01,930
and calls Hugh McGrath on the lobby phone.

824
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:25,700
It's done.

825
01:15:32,250 --> 01:15:35,840
Unless they take it apart,
there's no way to know it's been modified.

826
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:38,170
Fuckin' brilliant. What'll set it off?

827
01:15:38,260 --> 01:15:39,470
The internal clock.

828
01:15:39,550 --> 01:15:41,300
I'll input the time
once we know the flight.

829
01:15:41,390 --> 01:15:43,850
There's a security conference
in Rome tomorrow.

830
01:15:43,930 --> 01:15:47,520
All the top MPs and security people are
flying there on three lunchtime flights.

831
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:49,640
Perfect. What about our mule?

832
01:15:50,390 --> 01:15:51,850
Sara just confirmed he's going.

833
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:55,190
We then ran the burn-mark
through the database.

834
01:15:55,270 --> 01:15:57,230
We got a positive hit
on a Patrick O'Reilly,

835
01:15:57,320 --> 01:15:59,030
age 29, from Belfast.

836
01:15:59,610 --> 01:16:03,070
O'Reilly had one prior for a domestic
abuse incident three years back.

837
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:04,700
Did two months in Hydebank.

838
01:16:05,330 --> 01:16:08,500
We entered O'Reilly
into the facial rec bank for matches.

839
01:16:08,580 --> 01:16:09,870
We got a hit.

840
01:16:12,210 --> 01:16:15,500
That's him in a Dublin pub
with an IRA member four weeks ago.

841
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:18,760
It's a known IRA meeting place
we've had under surveillance for years.

842
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:23,840
And the other two with him?

843
01:16:24,090 --> 01:16:25,930
I was about to get to them,
Minister.

844
01:16:26,010 --> 01:16:28,640
That and a woman we've just ID'd
at the bus explosion.

845
01:16:35,690 --> 01:16:36,650
Yes.

846
01:16:37,110 --> 01:16:38,900
Your mole's Hugh McGrath.

847
01:16:40,990 --> 01:16:42,280
Did you hear me, Hennessy?

848
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:44,740
Are you sure now?

849
01:16:44,910 --> 01:16:45,910
Quite.

850
01:16:46,950 --> 01:16:50,370
We've ID'd the Knightsbridge bomber
as Patrick O'Reilly of Belfast.

851
01:16:50,450 --> 01:16:54,210
Three weeks ago, Mr. O'Reilly was observed
meeting Hugh McGrath in a Dublin pub.

852
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:56,880
Where's McGrath and O'Reilly now?

853
01:16:58,300 --> 01:16:59,880
I don't know O'Reilly.

854
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:02,550
I haven't seen McGrath.

855
01:17:02,630 --> 01:17:04,340
Let me help you with McGrath.

856
01:17:05,550 --> 01:17:09,010
His phone's GPS puts him
52 meters south of you.

857
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:11,390
I'm watching him coming up your drive.

858
01:17:12,310 --> 01:17:13,730
So, let's cut the shit.

859
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:17,480
There's a Chinook airborne
right now with a 12-man team.

860
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:21,150
They'll land on your farm in 30 minutes
to take McGrath into custody.

861
01:17:21,230 --> 01:17:24,240
I needn't tell you how that'll go,
nor how your cozy relationship with him

862
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:25,860
will sink your career...

863
01:17:26,110 --> 01:17:27,370
This time for good.

864
01:17:29,370 --> 01:17:30,370
Or?

865
01:17:30,450 --> 01:17:32,700
Question McGrath your way
and get what I need.

866
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:34,620
Names and locations of everyone.

867
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:37,420
You can't save him,
but maybe you can save yourself.

868
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:40,630
Thirty minutes, get what I need,
I'll turn them around.

869
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:43,670
Jim.

870
01:17:48,930 --> 01:17:53,270
Send McGrath's men to the trailhead,
see if Sean needs any help.

871
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:03,650
Give me your phone.

872
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:05,280
- What the hell?
- Give me your phone.

873
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:10,080
Get your ass in that chair there,
you motherfucker.

874
01:18:11,990 --> 01:18:14,040
- A London bus, for Christ sake!
- Now hold on.

875
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:15,410
Not even fuckin' warnings!

876
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,540
Sixteen dead.

877
01:18:17,620 --> 01:18:20,340
You stabbed me in the back
and sanctioned this bloodbath

878
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:21,880
to get your war back on.

879
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:24,630
The plan had no balls.

880
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:26,800
This wasn't a Bombing Light campaign.

881
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:28,840
You said hurt 'em, and hurt 'em we did.

882
01:18:28,930 --> 01:18:30,640
By killing women and children?

883
01:18:31,390 --> 01:18:33,470
You can't restrain yourself.

884
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:35,310
You never could. Well, it's over.

885
01:18:36,810 --> 01:18:39,310
Their names, aliases, and location.

886
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:42,900
You know I can't do that.

887
01:18:43,070 --> 01:18:44,820
That's me being nice.

888
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:47,450
Now write. And it better match
what I already know.

889
01:18:47,530 --> 01:18:51,200
By God, I'll take you apart
joint by joint!

890
01:18:51,910 --> 01:18:53,410
You used me.

891
01:18:53,660 --> 01:18:57,160
You wanted the pardons
for your own political gain.

892
01:18:57,250 --> 01:18:59,290
You're a disgrace to the cause.

893
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:03,340
Four men and a woman.

894
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:09,260
Maggie Dunn?

895
01:19:09,470 --> 01:19:12,430
Aye. You call her that.

896
01:19:13,310 --> 01:19:15,560
Sara Mackay's her real name.

897
01:19:18,390 --> 01:19:19,810
She works for you?

898
01:19:20,690 --> 01:19:22,230
Bloody right.

899
01:19:22,310 --> 01:19:23,650
Checks and balances.

900
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:32,450
An insurance policy,
in case you lose your nerve,

901
01:19:32,530 --> 01:19:36,370
which you have.
So now, if they take the lads,

902
01:19:37,290 --> 01:19:40,420
she will lead them straight back to you.

903
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:43,210
Not so easy anymore now, is it?

904
01:19:43,630 --> 01:19:46,920
SO15 will be here
in 20 minutes to take you in.

905
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:49,800
We both know that can't happen.

906
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:55,220
You gave me up to the Brits?

907
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:58,980
You tout bastard!

908
01:19:59,060 --> 01:20:00,640
You gave yourself up.

909
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:05,150
They've got surveillance of you
in an IRA pub with a Pat O'Reilly,

910
01:20:05,230 --> 01:20:07,280
who they ID'd as the Knightsbridge bomber.

911
01:20:07,530 --> 01:20:10,280
And thanks to your GPS phone,
they tracked you here.

912
01:20:14,660 --> 01:20:16,450
You broke every rule, Hughie.

913
01:20:18,290 --> 01:20:22,330
And now I'm left to clean up your mess
as I have for the past 30 years.

914
01:20:27,550 --> 01:20:28,590
A final thing.

915
01:20:30,970 --> 01:20:31,880
My wife?

916
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:34,800
What about her?

917
01:20:40,980 --> 01:20:45,610
She hates you because of her brother.

918
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:48,110
And so she reached out to me.

919
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:51,990
So, yes, I helped her...

920
01:20:52,820 --> 01:20:53,990
And she helped me.

921
01:21:12,470 --> 01:21:14,550
- Yes.
- Bromley.

922
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:16,970
I got your names.

923
01:21:26,860 --> 01:21:28,940
Oh, shit, I'm late. I've got to go.

924
01:21:31,190 --> 01:21:32,240
Did you cum?

925
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:35,610
No.
I'm not a three-second wonder like you.

926
01:22:20,830 --> 01:22:23,950
Well, keep wearing that shirt,
I'll be a two-second wonder.

927
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:25,870
You're gonna have to get used to it.

928
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:31,460
Practice, practice, practice.

929
01:22:41,890 --> 01:22:42,890
I'm close.

930
01:22:43,060 --> 01:22:47,140
McGrath confessed.
It was his op all along.

931
01:22:47,270 --> 01:22:51,980
I've got the bombers' names and location.
I'll text you the info. You may need it.

932
01:22:52,070 --> 01:22:55,320
The one that killed Quan's daughter
is Pat O'Reilly.

933
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:57,450
He's got a burn-mark on his right hand.

934
01:22:57,530 --> 01:23:02,580
Either way, Sean, you end this, now.

935
01:23:03,030 --> 01:23:05,200
- You hear me?
- Understood.

936
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:41,090
You know why you're still alive?

937
01:24:41,340 --> 01:24:44,260
You want the names?

938
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:50,020
They're in the phone.
The last text, code 7741.

939
01:24:52,140 --> 01:24:54,150
Five names and their location in London.

940
01:24:55,270 --> 01:24:57,570
O'Reilly set the bomb
that killed your daughter.

941
01:24:59,030 --> 01:25:01,150
He's got a burn-mark on his right hand.

942
01:25:02,450 --> 01:25:04,200
You fought in the army.

943
01:25:04,570 --> 01:25:07,740
Iraq. Royal Irish Regiment.

944
01:25:08,990 --> 01:25:10,200
Two tours, Special Forces.

945
01:25:13,710 --> 01:25:17,090
You're Catholic,
but you fought for British. Why?

946
01:25:17,170 --> 01:25:18,710
I fought for the regiment.

947
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:23,590
Out there, religion didn't matter.
We were all the same. That's it.

948
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:26,930
Family?

949
01:25:27,510 --> 01:25:28,600
A brother.

950
01:25:30,390 --> 01:25:31,810
The rest have passed away.

951
01:26:12,430 --> 01:26:14,810
Come in.

952
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:20,270
Take a seat, Sean.

953
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:27,570
Aye. You look like
you've been through the wars.

954
01:26:27,860 --> 01:26:31,200
Aye. Quan got the drop on me.

955
01:26:32,490 --> 01:26:35,160
I gave him the names,
he took my things and let me go.

956
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:37,960
When the bombers called in about the bus,

957
01:26:39,130 --> 01:26:41,250
they didn't use a code word,

958
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:43,250
because someone tipped them off.

959
01:26:44,510 --> 01:26:48,090
Only two people knew
the reason for the code change.

960
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:51,220
You and me.

961
01:26:51,300 --> 01:26:54,560
Liam, I didn't tell anyone. I swear.
I spoke to Bromley, and that was it.

962
01:26:55,060 --> 01:26:58,560
What if I told you I had Murphy stay

963
01:26:58,650 --> 01:27:00,650
and watch Mary in London?

964
01:27:04,690 --> 01:27:06,780
My own flesh and blood.

965
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:08,150
Liam, I'm so sorry.

966
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:10,490
I don't wanna know
what happened in that room.

967
01:27:12,370 --> 01:27:16,040
All I wanna know is, what was discussed

968
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:19,710
when your sweet Aunt Mary was with you?

969
01:27:19,790 --> 01:27:22,170
Did she say she was involved
with McGrath and the bombers?

970
01:27:22,250 --> 01:27:23,290
No. Never.

971
01:27:24,340 --> 01:27:26,300
She was upset about her brother
and kept on about that.

972
01:27:26,380 --> 01:27:28,800
When you and I were talking
about the code word, she asked about 'em,

973
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:30,130
but she never let on about McGrath.

974
01:27:30,220 --> 01:27:32,390
Oh, so, she could hear us on the phone?

975
01:27:32,470 --> 01:27:34,810
No, it was only after our call
she mentioned the code word.

976
01:27:34,890 --> 01:27:37,480
- She thought they wouldn't be of use.
- So, she steered the conversation?

977
01:27:38,100 --> 01:27:39,600
Well, yes, I guess she did.

978
01:27:39,690 --> 01:27:42,770
Ah. A good manipulator, she is.

979
01:27:42,860 --> 01:27:44,020
So, she told the bombers?

980
01:27:44,110 --> 01:27:47,070
She told McGrath, McGrath told them.

981
01:27:47,150 --> 01:27:48,650
Thick as thieves, they were.

982
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:52,160
She tricked the information
out of ya, Sean.

983
01:27:53,530 --> 01:27:55,290
She used you.

984
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:57,370
- Liam, I...
- Shut up!

985
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:11,800
Bury that pig in the sow-pen.

986
01:28:13,260 --> 01:28:15,890
And after that,
I have one final task for you.

987
01:28:17,220 --> 01:28:18,640
And when that's done...

988
01:28:21,270 --> 01:28:23,020
go back to New York, son.

989
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:52,970
Thank you.

990
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:05,810
Zero, this is Alpha Two.
Echo One toward target house.

991
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:08,940
Zero. Echo One's
toward the target house. Copy.

992
01:29:09,650 --> 01:29:12,610
Echo One has entered
the target house and unsighted to me.

993
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:16,240
Zero. Echo One is in target house
and unsighted to you. Copy.

994
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:17,620
Thank Christ for that.

995
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:22,210
Sierra call signs. Confirm when Echo One
is complete in target house.

996
01:29:22,290 --> 01:29:23,870
Sierra Two, roger that.

997
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:27,040
Sierra Three, roger that.

998
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:35,180
X-Ray One on balcony.

999
01:29:39,140 --> 01:29:40,720
Echo One approaching front door.

1000
01:29:55,820 --> 01:29:56,910
How'd it go?

1001
01:29:57,910 --> 01:29:58,910
It's done.

1002
01:30:06,540 --> 01:30:09,040
I have visual. X-Ray One
and Echo One have left the room.

1003
01:30:09,130 --> 01:30:10,590
All other X-Rays remain.

1004
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:22,930
Zero, this is Alpha Two.

1005
01:30:23,020 --> 01:30:25,560
One unknown Echo and two children
entering the target house.

1006
01:30:25,730 --> 01:30:26,640
Roger that.

1007
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:50,130
He's a slobbering oaf.

1008
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:51,420
It had to be done.

1009
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:54,760
I had to shag him.
It was fuckin' disgusting.

1010
01:30:55,380 --> 01:30:57,430
Look, I know what you
went through. All right?

1011
01:30:57,510 --> 01:30:59,140
Do ya, Denis? Do ya really?

1012
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:02,100
Well, maybe for the next bomb,
you can set up a gay Magistrate.

1013
01:31:02,180 --> 01:31:03,430
How would that be?

1014
01:31:04,020 --> 01:31:05,390
Taking a shower.

1015
01:31:07,850 --> 01:31:08,810
Next.

1016
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:29,540
X-Ray One entering living room.

1017
01:31:31,460 --> 01:31:33,790
All X-Rays now complete in living room.

1018
01:31:34,590 --> 01:31:36,590
All call signs
move to your final rendezvous.

1019
01:32:16,380 --> 01:32:18,630
X-Rays and Echo complete in living room.

1020
01:32:28,640 --> 01:32:31,270
We've lost visual.
Echo One has closed the blinds.

1021
01:32:31,980 --> 01:32:33,850
Fox One, you have control.

1022
01:32:33,940 --> 01:32:35,940
Roger that. I have control.

1023
01:32:36,020 --> 01:32:37,570
Standby. Standby.

1024
01:32:41,820 --> 01:32:43,200
Stop, stop, stop!

1025
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:44,370
Wait!

1026
01:32:51,460 --> 01:32:53,830
Sierra call signs, report what's going on.

1027
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:56,090
I've two unknowns
at the front door. Wait.

1028
01:32:56,170 --> 01:32:58,800
Sorry for the bother,
but there's a gas leak in the building,

1029
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:01,920
and the gas man
needs entry for an inspection.

1030
01:33:02,050 --> 01:33:05,050
Our gas works fine. There's no problem.

1031
01:33:05,890 --> 01:33:07,930
He needs to inspect
all the flats, regardless.

1032
01:33:08,010 --> 01:33:10,680
He won't take a moment,
and it is an emergency.

1033
01:33:15,190 --> 01:33:17,820
It's quite important, Mr. Upton.

1034
01:33:17,900 --> 01:33:20,530
By law, I'm allowed to use my own key.

1035
01:33:20,610 --> 01:33:23,950
All right. Just a second.

1036
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:39,210
Come down when you're done,
and I'll take you to the next flat.

1037
01:33:39,300 --> 01:33:40,960
Thank you. I will be very fast.

1038
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:47,800
This way.

1039
01:34:10,950 --> 01:34:12,330
Can I see the boiler, please?

1040
01:34:12,410 --> 01:34:14,540
Would you mind
putting your bag on the table?

1041
01:34:21,590 --> 01:34:22,670
Open it up.

1042
01:34:34,020 --> 01:34:34,980
All right.

1043
01:34:55,830 --> 01:34:57,870
All call signs, standby, standby.

1044
01:36:40,680 --> 01:36:41,730
All call signs, go!

1045
01:36:52,910 --> 01:36:54,660
Get down! Get down!

1046
01:36:54,740 --> 01:36:57,410
Get down! Get down! Get down!

1047
01:36:59,700 --> 01:37:00,830
Room clear!

1048
01:37:05,750 --> 01:37:06,710
X-Rays down.

1049
01:37:06,790 --> 01:37:08,380
What about Echo?

1050
01:37:08,460 --> 01:37:10,010
She's alive, under control.

1051
01:37:11,470 --> 01:37:12,550
Who planned this?

1052
01:37:13,260 --> 01:37:14,340
Go fuck yourself.

1053
01:37:21,180 --> 01:37:22,810
What's this, eh? Your next bomb?

1054
01:37:22,980 --> 01:37:24,100
Go fuck yourself.

1055
01:37:29,150 --> 01:37:30,730
Talk, you rotten slag!

1056
01:37:39,240 --> 01:37:40,700
It's too late.

1057
01:37:42,370 --> 01:37:44,920
Nine minutes it blows. No time to land.

1058
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:49,210
What's that? A plane? Which plane?

1059
01:37:49,300 --> 01:37:50,500
Which plane?

1060
01:37:51,130 --> 01:37:52,550
Open her shirt.

1061
01:38:00,310 --> 01:38:01,470
This is how it works.

1062
01:38:02,890 --> 01:38:06,190
I ask questions. You answer.

1063
01:38:06,850 --> 01:38:11,860
That's right. Flight 136 to Rome.
Passenger name Ian Wood.

1064
01:38:11,940 --> 01:38:12,820
Bomb's in his laptop.

1065
01:38:13,240 --> 01:38:15,360
Set to go off at 3:00 p.m. exactly.

1066
01:38:15,450 --> 01:38:18,070
Ladies and gentlemen,
please be advised.

1067
01:38:18,160 --> 01:38:21,580
Flight 136 to Rome
has been further delayed.

1068
01:38:21,660 --> 01:38:23,700
We apologize for the inconvenience.

1069
01:38:23,790 --> 01:38:26,120
Again, Flight 136 to Rome...

1070
01:38:26,210 --> 01:38:29,130
Ian Wood!
Is there an Ian Wood here?

1071
01:38:29,210 --> 01:38:31,500
Ian Wood! Ian Wood?

1072
01:38:31,590 --> 01:38:34,300
Is there an Ian Wood here? Ian Wood?

1073
01:38:35,050 --> 01:38:39,220
Ian Wood? Ian Wood? Ian Wood?

1074
01:38:40,640 --> 01:38:42,560
What's going on? What's going on?

1075
01:38:42,640 --> 01:38:44,890
They're looking for someone
named Ian Wood.

1076
01:38:44,980 --> 01:38:47,100
That's me. I'm Ian Wood.

1077
01:38:47,190 --> 01:38:48,980
Ian Wood!

1078
01:38:49,060 --> 01:38:50,110
I'm Ian Wood.

1079
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:52,980
- Is that your laptop?
- Yeah.

1080
01:38:55,110 --> 01:38:57,070
Move! Move! Move!

1081
01:38:57,150 --> 01:38:59,950
Get down! Get down! Get down! Get down!

1082
01:39:00,410 --> 01:39:02,280
Get down! Get down!

1083
01:39:02,790 --> 01:39:04,500
Get down! Get down!

1084
01:39:04,580 --> 01:39:06,120
Move! Move!

1085
01:39:06,210 --> 01:39:07,750
Get down! Get down! Move!

1086
01:39:07,830 --> 01:39:12,340
Get outta the way! Get out!
Move here! Get out!

1087
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:14,880
Move!

1088
01:39:35,780 --> 01:39:39,530
She said a gas man turned up
with an assault gun, a Chinaman.

1089
01:39:39,610 --> 01:39:42,910
Started shooting, killed everyone but her,
and then walked out the door.

1090
01:39:42,990 --> 01:39:44,450
She said he was a Chinaman?

1091
01:39:44,540 --> 01:39:46,500
Affirmative. About 60 years old.

1092
01:39:46,580 --> 01:39:48,330
Just got word
the device is neutralized.

1093
01:39:48,410 --> 01:39:51,580
Good work. Fox Hunt is now terminated.

1094
01:39:51,790 --> 01:39:53,380
No loose ends.

1095
01:39:53,460 --> 01:39:54,920
Understood.

1096
01:40:05,680 --> 01:40:09,100
It's Bromley. I need an AP
out to all city-district units

1097
01:40:09,180 --> 01:40:11,690
from Wapping High Street to the A1203.

1098
01:40:12,860 --> 01:40:17,820
Suspect's an Asian male, 61 years of age,
five feet, eight inches, 11 stone.

1099
01:40:18,490 --> 01:40:20,360
His name's Ngoc Minh Quan.

1100
01:40:20,490 --> 01:40:23,570
He's armed
and has U.S. Special Forces training.

1101
01:40:23,660 --> 01:40:25,410
Use extreme caution.

1102
01:40:54,310 --> 01:40:55,150
Yes.

1103
01:40:55,400 --> 01:40:58,280
I was on the flight
they targeted to blow up.

1104
01:40:58,360 --> 01:41:00,150
Because of your timely information,
we stopped it.

1105
01:41:00,240 --> 01:41:01,900
I wanted to thank you personally.

1106
01:41:03,490 --> 01:41:05,070
Thank God you're OK.

1107
01:41:05,530 --> 01:41:08,620
The bombers were neutralized,
even Sara McKay,

1108
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:11,370
whom you called "Maggie."

1109
01:41:13,580 --> 01:41:17,290
She gave a reporter the bomb
that was to have been put on my flight.

1110
01:41:17,590 --> 01:41:19,760
She also carried out the bus carnage,

1111
01:41:19,880 --> 01:41:24,510
and is directly connected to you,
and McGrath.

1112
01:41:25,050 --> 01:41:27,810
We have call-pens going
to and from her off the cell tower

1113
01:41:27,890 --> 01:41:29,470
by your farm and town homes.

1114
01:41:29,560 --> 01:41:32,100
That's 250 precision locations
and activations

1115
01:41:32,180 --> 01:41:34,770
- consistent with your mutual activities.
- Katherine...

1116
01:41:34,850 --> 01:41:38,070
I've spoken to the PM.
He's agreed to keep you in office for now.

1117
01:41:38,150 --> 01:41:40,980
I'm issuing pardons
for five On-the-Runs, one is your cousin.

1118
01:41:41,070 --> 01:41:44,700
But, make no mistake,
Deputy First Minister, you are ours now.

1119
01:41:45,990 --> 01:41:47,740
I say jump, you say where.

1120
01:41:48,620 --> 01:41:50,370
You're on the next flight back to London.

1121
01:41:50,450 --> 01:41:53,500
Tomorrow you'll brief
SO15 and myself on everything you know.

1122
01:41:54,710 --> 01:41:56,290
All of it.

1123
01:42:50,140 --> 01:42:51,180
Good evening, sir.

1124
01:43:30,090 --> 01:43:31,140
How did you find me?

1125
01:43:32,890 --> 01:43:34,640
I gave you the names, like I said.

1126
01:43:38,770 --> 01:43:43,270
This woman, she's a bomber.
You lie. You plan everything.

1127
01:43:44,780 --> 01:43:46,190
For whatever it's worth...

1128
01:43:47,820 --> 01:43:50,280
I never intended to hurt your daughter

1129
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:52,910
or any of those people.

1130
01:43:55,870 --> 01:43:57,040
Send.

1131
01:43:59,250 --> 01:44:00,250
Do it!

1132
01:44:16,220 --> 01:44:19,060
It's now on the Internet,
you and your mistress.

1133
01:44:19,810 --> 01:44:22,190
The whole world will know
you are a terrorist.

1134
01:44:24,860 --> 01:44:26,530
Good-bye, Mr. Hennessy.

1135
01:45:16,660 --> 01:45:17,700
Yes?

1136
01:45:17,780 --> 01:45:20,500
It's Landesman, sir, in S-11.
I've got him.

1137
01:45:20,580 --> 01:45:21,580
Where?

1138
01:45:21,660 --> 01:45:24,710
The Happy Peacock Takeaway.
He's returned.

1139
01:45:24,790 --> 01:45:26,460
Do I send in a team?

1140
01:45:27,880 --> 01:45:29,000
No.

1141
01:45:30,380 --> 01:45:32,380
I believe we owe this chap something.

1142
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:36,470
Keep back for now.
Observe and report only.

1143
01:45:36,550 --> 01:45:37,550
Yes, sir.
