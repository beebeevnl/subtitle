1
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:34,302
-You like it?
-All right.

2
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:35,762
I need to go. My dad's here.

3
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:37,305
-I'll see you tonight.
-Yeah.

4
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,273
This is the dress. Do you like it?

5
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:50,485
We've got to hurry. Everyone's going.
There's only two left in my size.

6
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,447
Come on, Dad, let's go.

7
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,208
When do I meet him?

8
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:07,794
His name's Chappy.

9
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:08,878
On the football team and very--

10
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,922
-Chubby?
-Chappy.

11
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:13,466
You'll meet when he picks me up
for the dance.

12
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,051
Not before?

13
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,303
Dad, you really need to go faster.

14
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,266
Will he drive you to the dance?

15
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,143
He's rented a limo.

16
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,436
So he won't drive you?

17
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:29,482
Limos come with drivers. So stop worrying.

18
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:38,616
It's a nice dress. You'll be very pretty.

19
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,451
I want you to like it.

20
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,269
-I'm getting out.
-No, no, no. Wait until I park.

21
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,770
Everyone's already inside.

22
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:11,691
Fan, careful crossing the street!

23
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:48,102
You stupid--

24
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,173
Metro desk, Ian Wood.

25
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:00,883
Listen carefully.

26
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,635
An action wing of the Authentic IRA

27
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,680
has just exploded a bomb
at the OBT Bank in Knightsbridge.

28
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:08,308
The code word is "Phoenix."

29
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,185
Britain's banks are now targets
for the Authentic IRA.

30
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:15,148
The bombings will continue as long as
Britain's financial criminal institutions

31
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:18,651
persist in their support of the illegal
occupation of Northern Ireland.

32
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:28,578
A bomb just went off,
an OBT Bank in Knightsbridge.

33
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,330
A group called the Authentic IRA just
phoned it in. They're claiming credit.

34
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:32,749
Who's the Authentic IRA?

35
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:34,083
No idea. Never heard of them.

36
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:39,088
Christ. There goes the Peace Accord
right back in the shit.

37
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:42,967
Listen up. A bank has just
been bombed in Knightsbridge.

38
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:46,721
A group calling itself
the Authentic IRA just phoned it in.

39
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,806
I want to know who they are,
who's behind them.

40
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,808
Call the Met, Sinn Fein,
monitor the blogs.

41
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:54,020
Is it the IRA or is it something else?
ISIS? Al-Qaeda?

42
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,105
What are you waiting for? Get over there.

43
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,329
...have asked
a number of police officials

44
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,247
for current estimates
on the dead and wounded...

45
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:07,343
This is a major incident
that they're treating

46
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,554
as a possible terrorist attack.

47
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,848
The bomb went off at exactly...

48
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,016
...4:15 GMT in Knightsbridge.

49
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,185
One theory on the cause of the blast

50
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,063
was that it may have been
a gasoline explosion underground.

51
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,066
How many? How many I get?

52
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,486
Twelve dead so far,
three times as many injured.

53
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,865
The explosion was centered
at the OBT Bank Branch in Knightsbridge.

54
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,659
There was no warning and police
were taken completely by surprise.

55
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:33,578
Fuck warnings. That'll teach 'em.

56
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,124
Any problems?

57
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,004
-No.
-We should be moving.

58
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,464
That's normal procedure.

59
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:48,217
Every cop, hotel, and landlady in London
is now looking for the Irishman.

60
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,972
This place is safe,
so long as we stay put.

61
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,745
Could I go to jail
if I murdered your phone?

62
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:22,335
Destruction of government property?
Absolutely.

63
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:26,005
Too bad. What's the time?

64
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,925
Almost 10:00. Ten more minutes.

65
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,636
Um, I'll miss my flight.

66
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:37,892
Let's stay here,
door locked, blinds down...

67
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,269
Room service for a week.

68
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,522
Sound good?

69
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,649
And your work, Deputy Minister?

70
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,027
An acute case of food poisoning.

71
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,074
You need to work on your excuses, darling.

72
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,516
Jesus Christ.

73
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,185
There's been an IRA bombing in London.

74
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,896
Scores dead and injured.

75
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,073
-Yes?
-Jesus, Liam.

76
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:37,535
Half the world's trying to find you.
Do you even know what's happened?

77
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:38,869
Yes, yes, yes, I heard.

78
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:41,289
I've been trying you for hours.
Where've you been?

79
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:43,082
Meetings.

80
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,167
- Meetings?
- Aye.

81
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,004
And last night?

82
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,715
You didn't come home. I was worried.

83
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:56,178
Came in late, left early.
Lot of work to catch up on.

84
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,890
But the guest room wasn't slept in.

85
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,517
Who said I slept?

86
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,768
Oh, cut the crap, Liam.

87
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,895
You didn't come home, plain and simple.

88
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,480
And what if I didn't!

89
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,984
Look, I've got a lot to deal with, OK?

90
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,320
So, don't wait up, and don't be worried.

91
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:17,533
Sunday is the 20th anniversary
of my brother's death.

92
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:21,996
Saint Mary's is dedicating
a mass to him, so...

93
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,957
I'll have Beth put it in the calendar, OK?
We'll talk later.

94
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:27,877
Oh, Jesus.

95
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:03,180
Yes, I understand
the need for swift action.

96
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:06,308
But until we can identify the threat,
there's not much we can do.

97
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,228
Well, you have your finger
on the pulse over there, Liam.

98
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,521
We're depending on you.

99
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:13,983
Anything you can provide, anything at all,
would be a tremendous help.

100
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:15,693
I'm meeting the Council now.

101
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:18,612
I'll shake the trees as hard
as I can and see what falls.

102
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,739
But, Kate, this is crucial.

103
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,367
We've managed to keep the lid on this
for 19 years now.

104
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:27,705
But there are new upstarts in the ranks
pressing for the way things were.

105
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,081
I could use something now.

106
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,834
And you know what I'm referring to.

107
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,462
The Royal Pardons.

108
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:39,091
I remember your list, the 40"On-the-Runs."
Are we really back to that?

109
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,343
My cousin's on that list.

110
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:44,555
He hasn't even been convicted
of any paramilitary offenses.

111
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:48,267
These people are suspects
in many things, including murder.

112
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,645
These people are critical
to holding the peace together now.

113
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:55,816
A few letters of pardon
would be a small gesture.

114
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,110
We keep it quiet.

115
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,529
But knowing it's been considered,
gives me leeway

116
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,199
to press certain men
for something in return.

117
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:05,743
As Irish Deputy Minister,

118
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,661
you have served the British
government honorably,

119
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,371
which hasn't always been easy.

120
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,665
But appeasement is a dangerous thing.

121
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:14,001
These are longstanding issues.

122
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,961
That if addressed now
would smack of appeasement.

123
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,588
I need something, Kate.

124
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:21,008
The newer members haven't
lived the bloodshed and are easily swayed.

125
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:23,219
I'm trying to hold this together.

126
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:26,931
A gesture is all.
It would make a difference.

127
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,849
I'll consider it.

128
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:34,480
But I want something first,
something real.

129
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:36,857
Understood.

130
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,301
Hello?

131
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,519
We're closed. We open at 12:00.

132
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:16,438
Uh, we're looking for the owner,
a Mr. Quin Minh?

133
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:18,774
Quan.

134
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,401
Upstairs.

135
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:26,782
They were found on site,
not far from your daughter's body.

136
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,618
Can you positively identify them as hers?

137
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,663
Who did this?

138
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,292
As of now, sir, we don't know,
but we're going to find out.

139
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,336
Why my daughter?

140
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:43,424
Is there someone we can call

141
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:45,342
to come and be with you, Mr. Quan?

142
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,308
I have no more family.

143
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,858
These bombers, will you catch them?

144
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:01,775
Yes.

145
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:04,945
Will they get punished?

146
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,780
Yes, they certainly will.

147
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,533
We'll let ourselves out.

148
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:29,136
Ah, good morning, Hugh. Thanks for coming.

149
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:30,304
Been a long time, Liam.

150
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:33,098
It's been a long time, indeed.
Go on, take a chair, there.

151
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:34,850
All right, Hugh?

152
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,977
Now that we're all here,

153
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:40,814
does anyone know
who this Authentic IRA is?

154
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,652
Are they even part of the IRA?

155
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:50,240
Some new upstarts
or something else entirely? Hmm?

156
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:55,204
They're trying to undermine everything
we've achieved over the last 19 years.

157
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,622
Well, I won't have it.

158
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,584
They don't have the support of the people
who said no to the violence.

159
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:03,128
Our mandate's to uphold that choice

160
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,422
and maintain the Peace Accord
no matter what.

161
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:06,590
Are we in agreement?

162
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,468
There's a lot of support for their actions
amongst the younger ranks.

163
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:10,761
Hotheads.

164
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:14,223
Hotheads who don't remember
or know any better.

165
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,642
You were once one of those hotheads, Liam.

166
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:17,977
Aye.

167
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,521
Long ago, when it was the only way.

168
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:21,897
And what did it give us?

169
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:24,608
More graves than I care to remember.

170
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:28,195
This bombing rivals Omagh
with its civilian deaths.

171
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:32,116
It's unacceptable, anytime, anywhere!

172
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:34,368
And do you think the bombers
come from our ranks?

173
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:36,495
The Brits ID'd the explosive.

174
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:40,249
Czech-made Semtex from our dumps.

175
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,127
They also used our code word.

176
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:46,046
Which means they have
a contact in our command.

177
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,507
Maybe someone in this room.

178
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,763
They're trying to divide us,

179
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:58,392
put the Brits back on the streets again,
stir up the troubles all over again.

180
00:16:58,475 --> 00:16:59,768
Well, I won't have it!

181
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:03,272
I want a complete check
of all the arms dumps here and abroad,

182
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,648
everything verified,

183
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:07,276
guns, Semtex, the whole fuckin' lot.

184
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,362
- Jesus, you can't be serious.
- Never been more so, Patty.

185
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,823
We check 'em, and if something's missing,

186
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:15,409
we trace it back
to those who knew the location.

187
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,996
And then we deal with this internally.

188
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:21,623
Unless someone here's got a better idea.

189
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,333
What do we get in return?

190
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:24,877
Peace.

191
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:28,130
Is that so bad, Brennan?

192
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:31,425
Haven't you paid enough in family blood?

193
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,804
So, unless you all
want to trash what we have,

194
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,640
I need your full support and respect.

195
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,602
I want a complete list
of all the stocks within the week,

196
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:44,730
along with their locations,
and everyone who knows where they are.

197
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,815
And no fuckin' exceptions!

198
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:01,371
Show me.

199
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:05,584
We backtracked 47 minutes.
Clearly anticipated the CCTV.

200
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:08,212
He circled London for quite some time
prior to the bombing.

201
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,297
Now, this is the first
CC feed we have on him.

202
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:14,301
Heading southbound on the A413
near Wendover at 10:53 a.m.

203
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:17,429
We retrieved the serial number
from the bike's frame.

204
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,224
It was reported stolen
in Reading the night before.

205
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:23,477
The license plates were also stolen
from another bike in Reading.

206
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,187
What about phone calls?

207
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,439
Assuming that the bomb
was phone-activated,

208
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,858
we've dumped the five closest towers
to the blast zone

209
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,401
trying to ID any call terminating

210
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,653
at the time of the incident.

211
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:33,862
Sorry. Excuse me.

212
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,197
Yup.

213
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:37,991
For you.

214
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,536
- Bromley.
- He's here again, sir.

215
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,830
- The Chinese man.
- What?

216
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:45,707
The Chinaman.
It's five days in a row, now.

217
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,793
Christ. Tell him I'm busy.

218
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:50,587
I did, and he said he'd wait, again.

219
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:56,135
I assure you, this investigation
is our top priority, Mr. Quan.

220
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:59,596
And we're doing all we can
and pursuing every possible lead

221
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,931
to find those who killed your daughter.

222
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:08,438
But they're a difficult people to catch.

223
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,732
And it may take some time.

224
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,193
I need you to understand that.

225
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,863
You must catch these men,
Commander Bromley.

226
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:18,574
Again, it's our top priority.

227
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,457
Twenty thousand pound.

228
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:32,754
All I have for the names of the bombers.

229
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:38,468
-I'm sorry, but we can't take this.
-Then please tell me...

230
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:42,055
Just give me the name
of someone in the IRA.

231
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:46,602
To be clear, these are vicious men
who take pride in their atrocities.

232
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:50,731
Any attempt by you to contact them
is likely to end very badly.

233
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,108
This is our work, not yours.

234
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:55,485
You need to be patient.

235
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,161
How long have you been
in this country, Mr. Quan?

236
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:09,041
Since 1984. I'm a British citizen.

237
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,919
You were born in Guangxi, China.

238
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:16,840
Yes. I'm Chinese Nung.

239
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:19,301
I work in Saigon after the war.

240
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,886
We escaped to Singapore.

241
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,597
Then we immigrate here.

242
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,851
You had two daughters
before Fan.

243
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,854
Both killed during the escape.

244
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:32,856
And your wife?

245
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,399
Where is she now?

246
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:39,446
She died, giving birth to Fan.

247
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,576
I'm truly sorry for your loss.

248
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:50,040
But you mustn't keep coming here
on a daily basis.

249
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:55,295
It doesn't help, and diverts time
and resources from our investigation.

250
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,341
Do you understand?

251
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:05,639
Yes. I understand.

252
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:11,853
Thank you for seeing me,
Commander Bromley.

253
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:25,242
After three weeks
of investigations,

254
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:28,120
there's little in the way
of solid leads that I'm aware of.

255
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:30,372
The public is looking for reassurance.

256
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:34,167
One leading politician
who somberly may have answers,

257
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:37,170
lies uncomfortably
at the center of this storm.

258
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:39,840
We go now to an interview
I recorded earlier in Belfast

259
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,717
with Deputy Minister Liam Hennessy.

260
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,594
Deputy Minister Hennessy,

261
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,638
you've publicly condemned the bombings.

262
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,557
Yet, as a former leader of Sinn Fein

263
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,225
and a member of the IRA,

264
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,853
you took part in similar events years ago.

265
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:57,232
What's the essential difference between
those acts you were involved in then

266
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,401
and what's happened in London recently?

267
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:03,280
Hope. We had none,
just years of vengeance.

268
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:06,491
We needed to break the cycle,

269
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:09,703
so we committed
to a political path which lead to...

270
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:10,954
I've made you tea.

271
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:13,957
So, if you say "hope,"

272
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:17,377
why are these IRA men,
who come from your own ranks,

273
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,379
returning to the bombings?

274
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:24,009
I can say with reasonable certainty
that the IRA are not behind this.

275
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:27,345
They stand firmly behind
the agreement and the promises--

276
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,139
You can't be like this anymore.

277
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:30,766
You should eat something.

278
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,394
I'm getting you some noodles.

279
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:40,358
So, you're saying
possibly it's a financial problem

280
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:41,943
rather than a political one.

281
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:45,989
People look for scapegoats, for a way out.

282
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:48,033
And for some, they are more than happy

283
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:51,328
to resort to violence,
to upset the status quo.

284
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:02,506
Prepared for your signature.
They absolutely must be signed now.

285
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:05,133
What's the latest reaction
on social media?

286
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,594
Same as before. Fear and anger.

287
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,012
Anger directed at whom?

288
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,139
From the Prime Minister on down.

289
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,934
CNN and The Irish Times
want interviews with you.

290
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:16,019
You can do tonight
or tomorrow morning at 8:00.

291
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:18,313
Tomorrow morning by phone. What else?

292
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,482
You've a call waitin' on Line Two.

293
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,818
-Waiting?
-For 30 minutes now.

294
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,779
A Mr. Quan from London, very insistent.

295
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:29,074
-What does he want?
-His daughter was killed in the bombing.

296
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:32,244
I tried my best to console him,
but he really just wants to speak to you.

297
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:35,330
-He saw ya on TV.
-Oh, Christ, Beth.

298
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:37,791
Civic duty. Take it and be done.

299
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,841
This is Liam Hennessy. How may I help you?

300
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:49,261
Mr. Hennessy,
tell me who killed my daughter?

301
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:52,722
What on Earth makes you think
I know who killed your daughter?

302
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:55,851
Because, you are the First Deputy Minister

303
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:59,646
and advisor to Sinn Fein,
and a former IRA member.

304
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:04,359
I am truly sad for your loss, Mr. Quan.
I have a daughter myself.

305
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:07,445
And I condemn these acts of violence,
but I can't help you.

306
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,239
Then please tell me someone

307
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:12,617
who might know the names of the bombers,
someone I can talk to.

308
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:16,997
I don't have any connections
to those sorts of people. I'm sorry.

309
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,166
I don't believe you, Mr. Hennessy.

310
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:21,251
You are very powerful man.

311
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:24,671
Well, I work for the government
and our elected officials.

312
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,673
I do not work for terrorists.

313
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:31,469
IRA politics and terrorism
are different ends of the same snake.

314
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:34,347
Whichever end you grab,
you still grab a snake.

315
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:37,058
It makes a great deal
of difference which end you grab,

316
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,852
because one end will bite.

317
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:43,565
Again, I'm sorry for your loss, Mr. Quan.

318
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:44,649
Good day.

319
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:37,327
What are you doing?

320
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:41,164
You have to stop this.

321
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,336
This wasn't your fault.

322
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:50,590
I failed them.

323
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:57,722
What's this?

324
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:00,850
The restaurant is now yours.

325
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:04,729
You've been a good friend to me, Lam.

326
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,649
No more of this talk.

327
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,068
Look at me.

328
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:17,242
I'm not going home. I'm staying the night.
I will sleep on the couch.

329
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,869
And on Monday,
I'm taking you to see someone.

330
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,914
Someone to help you.
But no more of this talk. OK?

331
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:30,797
Quan!

332
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:41,034
I've been calling you
all night. Where were you?

333
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:42,869
What are you going to do?

334
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,122
When will you come back?

335
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,944
You have a room?

336
00:28:58,027 --> 00:29:01,114
These are important documents
that we must have today.

337
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:03,783
Yes, I will keep trying
the sender because,

338
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,619
apparently there's nothing else I can do,
which I find strange

339
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:09,247
and certainly not the service
I've come to expect.

340
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:14,461
Yes, 329174-N for November.

341
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:17,964
You tell your supervisor
I'll be calling back.

342
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,174
Good day.

343
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:22,177
Yes? May I help you?

344
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:24,971
Please, I would like to
speak to Mr. Hennessy.

345
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:27,348
-And your name?
-Ngoc Minh Quan.

346
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:29,476
You're the one who's been phoning.

347
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,561
Yes. I phoned many times.

348
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:35,273
I'm afraid the Deputy Minister is busy
and won't be able to see you.

349
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:39,110
-I will wait.
-No, you must leave.

350
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:41,362
Best do as the lady says.

351
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:44,282
He's been phoning up
at all hours asking for Liam.

352
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:45,283
He won't take no for an answer.

353
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:46,409
Just groceries.

354
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,289
Go now, before we make ya.

355
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:55,293
- No. I'm wait.
- Right.

356
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:04,219
It's the man who's been
phoning you from London.

357
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:07,180
He's got a knife on him.
One of those Swiss Army types.

358
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:10,391
Well, take it off him.

359
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,853
Jesus, how much damage
can he do with you two around?

360
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:15,271
Let him be.

361
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:17,607
As I explained before...

362
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,776
...I don't know who the bombers are.

363
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:22,695
I realize you're angry,
but there's not much I can do.

364
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:25,323
It's also very dangerous
for you to be here.

365
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:29,994
People in Belfast
won't take kindly to your accusations.

366
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:32,497
If you do not know who they are,

367
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,291
I would like you to please find out.

368
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,842
I haven't been affiliated
with the IRA for 30 years.

369
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:47,053
When I was,
I fought hard against the violence.

370
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:49,347
I went to prison
for what I did and paid my debt.

371
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:52,892
Now I serve the politics of both sides,

372
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:55,395
trying to heal the wounds
and bridge the divide.

373
00:30:56,729 --> 00:31:02,151
Again, my sincere condolences,
but there's nothing I can do.

374
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:05,905
What if your wife and daughter
were killed by bomb?

375
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,286
I'd do everything in my power
to get justice.

376
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:15,039
So, I've chosen you, Mr. Hennessy.

377
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:17,959
You will tell me who killed my child.

378
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:21,379
Again, I don't know.

379
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,551
You will change your mind.

380
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:33,057
Thank you for seeing me,
First Minister Hennessy.

381
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:50,677
I'm sorry, Liam. He took me by surprise.

382
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:03,147
You're OK, Beth. OK, you're OK.

383
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,941
Take her, take her.

384
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:07,610
- Murphy, have the boys check the building.
- Right.

385
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:08,987
Jesus.

386
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:23,668
Would you like a whiskey, Inspector?

387
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,920
No, thank you.

388
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:32,593
I suppose it would be a waste of time
asking who might've done this.

389
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,722
No one comes to mind.

390
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:40,727
Well, it appears to have been
nothing more than a warning.

391
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:43,062
Fortunately, it wasn't a serious bomb.

392
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:46,107
If it had been, we wouldn't
be here talking, would we?

393
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:51,863
Feel free to reach out,
should you have the unexpected urge.

394
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:55,658
I'll feed the press a gas leak story
in the meantime.

395
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:58,953
Fair enough. Thanks very much, Inspector.

396
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:02,707
Hello?

397
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:06,502
It's him.

398
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:15,470
You come to my office
and plant a fucking bomb?

399
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,930
- Have you changed your mind?
- Changed my mind?

400
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:20,099
Are you out of your fuckin' tree?

401
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:22,310
You have no idea who you're dealing with.

402
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,603
But you'll soon find out.

403
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:24,854
Give me the names.

404
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:27,482
I'll tell you what.
Let's meet face-to-face.

405
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:28,399
We'll settle--

406
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,904
The fuckin' wanker
threatened me and hung up.

407
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,826
Right. Let's check all the hotels
and guest houses.

408
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,369
He won't be hard to find.

409
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:43,998
Fuckin' Chinaman.

410
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:50,004
Uncle Liam? What's up?

411
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:56,260
I'll be there.

412
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:10,376
Stop! Hold it, hold it,
hold it! Don't move!

413
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:13,671
Don't move! She's wired to blow!

414
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:54,295
Two sets of wires
ten-foot long,

415
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:57,089
soldered to that light bulb
and covered with ground-up match heads.

416
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,717
Gives an extra kick.

417
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:02,178
Not needed, but a nice touch.

418
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:04,805
Crude, effective, and easy to spot.

419
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,474
So, he wanted us to see it.

420
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,768
Well, it wasn't in the tank,
so it wouldn't have worked.

421
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,020
He just wants you to know
he can get to ya.

422
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:14,565
Micky.

423
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,945
We found him.
A B&amp;B in Wellington Park.

424
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:21,405
- They found him.
- Grab him.

425
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:24,784
Drag him out of Belfast.
Discourage him from returning.

426
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:26,577
Wait for me. I'm on my way.

427
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,248
Hello.

428
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,541
I hear your office was bombed.

429
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:36,003
Hardly.
It was the toilet in the hall.

430
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,756
An Asian man in his 60s with a grudge.

431
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:40,258
It's all being taken care of.

432
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:41,467
Why'd he do it?

433
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:45,137
His child died in the bank bombing.
He thinks I know who did it.

434
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,098
He's not the only one of that mind.

435
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:50,893
- So, where are we with the pardons?
- Lots of resistance.

436
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:54,522
But, if you give us something useful,
things might turn in your favor.

437
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:57,358
I may have a lead. I'm pursuing it.

438
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:01,946
Well, let's hope it bears fruit.
People here want heads.

439
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:04,740
The dogs won't stay leashed much longer.

440
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:18,004
Top floor on the right.

441
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:26,549
Fuckin' get him!

442
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:55,202
Christ Almighty,
are you dumb and blind?

443
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:57,663
An old man making fools
out of the lot of you

444
00:40:57,746 --> 00:41:00,458
and he's still running around
out there, for God's sake.

445
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,793
You are four men. Four.

446
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:04,837
We had him cornered,
then he jumped off the roof

447
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,672
and slid down like some fuckin' monkey.

448
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:07,798
What is goin' on?

449
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:13,012
Pack your bag. You're going to the farm.

450
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:15,431
Go on.

451
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:17,183
Get your things.

452
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,564
- You all right, Sean?
- Hi, Christy.

453
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:25,274
Go on through, he's expecting ya.

454
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:32,573
Beat ya up. Come on in
and have a drink, for God's sake.

455
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:34,200
Well, look at ya.

456
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:36,160
-Jesus, the place looks well.
-It's not bad, is it?

457
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:38,204
- No.
- You're a sight for sore eyes.

458
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:39,788
So, how is New York treatin' ya?

459
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:42,958
- Ah, it's cold.
- Uh-huh.

460
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:46,921
Look, Murphy filled me in, there.
That bloody Chinaman.

461
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:49,465
He set off a bomb in my office,

462
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:52,134
put one in my Jag, and beat the bejesus
out of Mick and Jimmy.

463
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:57,806
- Do you want me to handle him?
- No. That's Kavanagh's problem.

464
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:02,603
I need your help with the London bombing.

465
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,981
Any idea who's behind it yet?

466
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:09,276
Not at all.

467
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:12,571
- Well, the Yanks aren't happy, Liam.
- Mm...

468
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:14,281
Dead women and kids
all over the news.

469
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,908
Any fundraising now is impossible.

470
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:18,827
Yeah, this is not about fundraising, Sean.

471
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:21,163
I need you to go to London
and meet someone...

472
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:25,751
A Richard Bromley in SO15.

473
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:28,170
SO15?

474
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:30,506
He needs to know the bombings aren't ours,

475
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:33,717
and that we're working the problem hard,
but we need his help.

476
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:34,802
Why me?

477
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:37,721
You're a decorated Ranger
in the Royal Irish Regiment.

478
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:42,268
Bromley will respect you as much
as he's capable of respecting any of us.

479
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:46,689
Should anyone find out
that we're talking to the Brits,

480
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:49,858
to go after one of our own, rogue or not,

481
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:52,027
there'll be the devil to pay.

482
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:55,781
So, can I count on you, Sean...

483
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:58,033
to be discreet?

484
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:00,828
Of course.

485
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,208
Right this way, sir.

486
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:49,293
Thank you very much.

487
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:01,722
You took your time.

488
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:05,684
I just had to put out
the odd fire here and there.

489
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:13,942
I'll be back in a minute.

490
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:15,027
I'll be right here.

491
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:29,875
Jesus.

492
00:44:58,404 --> 00:44:59,446
Mr. Morrison.

493
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:04,660
Commander Bromley.

494
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:09,164
- We're not responsible.
- Really?

495
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:12,167
Forensic evidence and the use
of your code word suggests otherwise.

496
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:14,962
It's a renegade unit.
We don't know who they are yet.

497
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:16,880
You're telling me
there's an active IRA unit

498
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:18,215
on the loose you know nothing about?

499
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:19,258
Yes, I am.

500
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:20,884
And the Semtex?

501
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:22,636
They're raiding our dumps.

502
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:24,763
Dumps that were
all given up for the Accord?

503
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:26,807
And your code word?

504
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:29,852
They're being helped by someone
in our command, Belfast or Dublin.

505
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:31,478
So, what do you want, Mr. Morrison?

506
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:33,772
We've a plan.

507
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:36,275
Different codes will be given
to each member of command.

508
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,235
When the bombers claim credit
for the next attack,

509
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:40,154
you'll tell us which word they use.

510
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:42,364
Then we'll know who gave
the orders and then we end it.

511
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:44,032
Who else is involved in this plan?

512
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:45,576
Liam Hennessy.

513
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:48,120
So, you can appreciate
the need for discretion.

514
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:49,913
Only Liam knows
who will be given which word.

515
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:52,833
So, Hennessy will personally work with us
to take out an IRA cell?

516
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:55,169
- A rogue cell.
- Your people, nonetheless.

517
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:59,047
I've one condition.

518
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:03,719
When Hennessy finds the bombers,
he tells me directly.

519
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:06,555
Then we take them down. Not you.

520
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:09,266
This is non-negotiable.

521
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:35,626
We found some plastic bags in his room.

522
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:38,921
Based on what I saw,
he's brewed up some nitroglycerin,

523
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:42,299
mixed it with weed killer, packed it
into some plastic plumbing pipes.

524
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:44,134
How much damage can he do?

525
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:47,638
I'm guessing he's made four bombs,
each enough to blow up a lorry.

526
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:48,722
Jesus.

527
00:46:48,805 --> 00:46:51,767
Knows what he's doing.
I've half the city looking for him.

528
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:54,394
When he surfaces in Belfast,
we'll find him.

529
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:56,563
You'll be safe here.

530
00:46:57,397 --> 00:47:01,109
Aye. I wouldn't count on it.

531
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:09,446
Benny!

532
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:23,812
Jesus Christ!

533
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:27,524
Move it! Move it!

534
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:43,749
Jesus. He roughed up Benny and Sean.
They'll be fine.

535
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:46,168
Get more men from Belfast.

536
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:49,713
I've underestimated him.
It won't happen again.

537
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:04,186
It's another warning, Liam?

538
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:07,105
Aye. Nothing I can't handle.

539
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:09,608
First Belfast, now here.

540
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:11,568
How in God's name
are you handling anything?

541
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:13,361
The problem's being dealt with.

542
00:51:14,112 --> 00:51:16,239
He is destroying our farmhouse,

543
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:19,284
intent on God knows what,
and you're calling it a problem?

544
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:22,496
God, you can be so pompous sometimes.

545
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:25,123
I'm leaving for London.
Gonna stay at Keri's.

546
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:26,583
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

547
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:29,085
Well, I wasn't asking for your permission.

548
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:32,088
He's hardly likely to know
about our daughter's flat, and besides,

549
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:33,590
it's you he's after, not me.

550
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:35,550
Well, the point is,
if he knows about the farmhouse,

551
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:38,261
I assume he knows about Keri's flat.

552
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:39,513
It's not worth the risk.

553
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:41,973
Well then, you're just gonna
have to handle it, like you said.

554
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:47,604
I remember a time when you would've
dealt with this, properly,

555
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:49,105
and other things, too.

556
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:51,608
But those days are gone.

557
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:26,476
Weighs a bit more,
but shouldn't be noticeable.

558
00:52:27,602 --> 00:52:30,605
All I'm adding is the Semtex,
a micro-chip and a few inches of wire.

559
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:32,440
It looks good.

560
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:36,361
Tricky part will be getting it through
the scanner, but, we'll find a way.

561
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:37,821
And if it's turned on?

562
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:41,283
Shorter battery life,
but it'll work, no problem.

563
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:42,617
Any idea which plane yet?

564
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:46,288
No. We don't want to hit a flight
with any Irish on board.

565
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:49,916
One in the queen's fleet'd be best.
We just need the right mule.

566
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:55,922
Code word has changed...

567
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:58,258
As of tonight.

568
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:03,346
My news editor's a complete twat.

569
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:07,100
Spends as much on a pair of shoes as I get
for eight hours writing crap like this.

570
00:53:07,183 --> 00:53:08,184
Makes perfect sense.

571
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:11,313
Who doesn't like a new pair of sexy shoes?

572
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:15,358
You should try a real whiskey.
Two Jamesons, single malt.

573
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:21,448
"Wife Attacks
Husband's Transgender Lover."

574
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:23,366
Some serious news you're writing there.

575
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:26,912
Well, if it pays, I'll write it.

576
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:28,455
Beats being knee-deep
in a bloody bomb site.

577
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:32,292
-So, what do you do?
-Wealth management.

578
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:42,844
I'm Maggie.

579
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:44,179
Ian.

580
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:51,019
All right.
I'll call if we need more.

581
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:52,687
- Thanks, Mary.
- All right, thanks. Bye.

582
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:57,359
Six more men
are on their way from Belfast.

583
00:53:57,442 --> 00:53:59,569
When they get here, they'll relieve
the fellas who've been up all night.

584
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:00,737
Is it enough to secure the farm?

585
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:04,240
Secure as it can be.
It's 20 total working two shifts.

586
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:08,244
All right. You're flying
to London today with Mary.

587
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:09,913
-Right, yeah.
-That's completely unnecessary.

588
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:12,582
Get her into Keri's flat,
then move them into a hotel.

589
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:14,084
I can manage this, all right?

590
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:15,669
I'll not be debating this!

591
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:18,296
Nick's gonna fill up the Jag.

592
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:19,839
You're leaving--

593
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:39,526
Take him to the hospital.

594
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:42,362
-Get Mary to the airport. Go.
-Right.

595
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:51,371
Buried nitro bomb, detonated by remote.

596
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:54,666
He needed a line of sight.

597
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:57,627
Those woods, that's where I'd be.

598
00:54:58,586 --> 00:55:01,506
-Go.
-Sean! Mick! Get in the car.

599
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:02,757
Go, go, go!

600
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:25,530
Come on. Go, go, go!

601
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:35,165
You guys spread out.
I'll take the high ground.

602
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:27,550
Names!

603
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:56,538
Jesus Christ!

604
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:59,415
One ol' man running circles
around the lot of us.

605
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:01,626
Why is it so hard?

606
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:04,587
He's ahead of us every step of the way.

607
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:06,506
We need more men.

608
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:08,800
We need 100 more men, at least.

609
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:11,719
And if we did that,
we'd have the whole of Belfast against us.

610
00:57:14,472 --> 00:57:17,517
Bring in a tracker,
someone who knows the woods,

611
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,018
and beat him at his own game.

612
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:21,771
My nephew?

613
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:24,482
Aye. If you can spare him.

614
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:54,971
Come on.

615
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:04,814
How's Keri? Where is she?

616
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:05,899
Out.

617
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:09,027
You're a wee bit early,
but I'm nearly ready.

618
00:58:09,694 --> 00:58:11,905
Have you a restaurant in mind?

619
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:13,698
Haven't given it much thought.

620
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:19,037
So, what urgencies
bring my nephew all the way to London?

621
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:21,623
A few personal matters.

622
00:58:22,957 --> 00:58:24,751
I'm glad I made the list.

623
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:29,756
Mm. I think that works.

624
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:31,716
What do you think?

625
00:58:56,824 --> 00:58:58,701
You've gotta be kiddin'.

626
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:06,918
-Liam?
-Tell Bromley I'll accept his terms.

627
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:08,545
I'll pass it on.

628
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:11,172
I've given out the code words.
Now we wait.

629
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:14,676
Quan hit us again.

630
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:17,929
Blew up the Jag,
put Billy in the hospital.

631
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:19,806
Kavanagh and the boys went after him.

632
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:24,185
The wee shitey injured three more men.
Punji sticks, if you can believe that.

633
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:27,522
Liam, it sounds like he's trained.
Maybe Special Forces.

634
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:29,023
Which brings me to the point.

635
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:32,819
I need a tracker, Sean.
Can you give us a hand?

636
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:35,947
- I'll take a morning flight.
- Good man.

637
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:48,459
Hey. How'd he sound?

638
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:51,296
Worried.

639
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:54,090
He's got a lot going on.

640
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:56,342
Well, if he doesn't
find the bombers, the Accord's dead.

641
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:58,469
And politically, so's he.

642
01:00:01,055 --> 01:00:02,515
Do you think he'll find them?

643
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:05,059
Yeah, if there's another blast.

644
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:09,314
The code word will lead us to
who's running them.

645
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:11,983
He's finished.
The code word won't save him.

646
01:00:13,234 --> 01:00:15,486
What the Council needs is new blood...

647
01:00:16,195 --> 01:00:18,406
someone stronger, like you.

648
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:21,743
He's afraid to use his power.

649
01:00:21,826 --> 01:00:25,204
He's just a washed-up old man
trying to hold onto whatever he can.

650
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:33,338
I've never forgiven him
for my brother Patrick.

651
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:36,382
Liam found out who killed him.

652
01:00:37,925 --> 01:00:41,679
A UVF death squad. Four men.

653
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:47,518
I told Liam to kill them
before they got to court.

654
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:49,103
But he said no.

655
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:52,315
That the time for revenge is past.

656
01:00:53,858 --> 01:00:56,903
So, my Patrick is dead and buried,

657
01:00:56,986 --> 01:01:00,198
and they're sitting in jail now,
all four of them,

658
01:01:00,281 --> 01:01:02,492
taking classes at the open university.

659
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:07,914
It's not right. It's not.

660
01:03:47,448 --> 01:03:49,033
Hugh McGrath's here.

661
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:58,084
I heard you're checking my dumps.

662
01:03:58,167 --> 01:04:01,212
We're checking everyone's. No exceptions.

663
01:04:01,587 --> 01:04:03,881
Four came up short. Two were yours.

664
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:06,008
Ten kilos of Semtex missing.

665
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:09,637
What in God's name are you doing?
My dumps were off-limits.

666
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:11,013
We were clear in that. Remember?

667
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:12,348
You were at the meeting.

668
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:14,851
If you knew they were short,
you should've handled it.

669
01:04:14,934 --> 01:04:18,521
They were in perfect order.
I checked 'em myself, and that's a fact.

670
01:04:21,482 --> 01:04:24,443
Christ, Liam, so the committee
knows it's my Semtex?

671
01:04:28,781 --> 01:04:31,993
Don't know who we can
trust anymore. Do we?

672
01:04:32,493 --> 01:04:33,995
Trust, or fear?

673
01:04:35,162 --> 01:04:37,290
In your case, mostly fear.

674
01:04:37,748 --> 01:04:39,709
Simple and brutal, like my da taught me.

675
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:45,631
Look, we have an opportunity here, Liam,
if you take the lead.

676
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,258
This Chinaman isn't helping matters,

677
01:04:47,341 --> 01:04:48,843
but let me get some locals
to hunt him down.

678
01:04:48,926 --> 01:04:50,845
-How much do you know?
-Plenty.

679
01:04:50,928 --> 01:04:53,389
Bomb in your office. Your farm. Your car.

680
01:04:53,472 --> 01:04:56,434
Mary and your daughter hiding out
in a London hotel, a bloody mess, it is.

681
01:04:56,517 --> 01:04:59,854
And the men sense weakness, as do the UVF.

682
01:04:59,937 --> 01:05:03,608
You should be back in Belfast,
out in front, taking charge.

683
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:06,652
-Look, I'm no politician...
-What're you trying to say?

684
01:05:07,528 --> 01:05:08,779
The bombing.

685
01:05:10,197 --> 01:05:13,701
A few quiet words of encouragement
would soothe the ranks.

686
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:15,202
"Encouragement"?

687
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:16,954
They kill civilians by the buckets.

688
01:05:17,038 --> 01:05:21,250
They went a bit far, I know,
but they have given us real momentum.

689
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:22,710
The Brits are on the ropes.

690
01:05:22,793 --> 01:05:26,839
Jesus Christ, I said hit a few
financial targets. That's it.

691
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:29,508
No one gets hurt.
That's what we agreed to.

692
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:32,637
-You gave me your word.
-And by God, I kept it.

693
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:36,307
I don't know who they are,
don't even know who's controlling 'em.

694
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:37,683
And that's the way it has to be.

695
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:40,811
Because, if something goes wrong,
they could trace 'em straight back to us.

696
01:05:40,895 --> 01:05:44,982
Go wrong? This wasn't the fuckin' plan.
I needed this to get our people back.

697
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:49,654
-You and I have spent our whole lifetime--
-You don't give a shit about those men.

698
01:05:49,737 --> 01:05:51,948
You needed the bombing
to shore up the election,

699
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:53,908
to prop up your weakness in the ranks.

700
01:05:53,991 --> 01:05:58,871
Well, guess what?
In the fog o' war, plans fuckin' change.

701
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:04,085
Now, I stood by you
when you put fire into the lads.

702
01:06:04,168 --> 01:06:07,296
M62, Aldershot, Mountbatten.

703
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,590
You were calling for an escalation then,
right enough.

704
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:11,926
Those days are long gone!

705
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:15,471
That's not what I heard a few months ago.

706
01:06:16,597 --> 01:06:21,394
I heard the old Liam,
a man back on track with a plan.

707
01:06:23,938 --> 01:06:26,732
You haven't forgotten
what we're fighting for, have ya?

708
01:06:27,316 --> 01:06:28,734
You question my loyalty?

709
01:06:29,568 --> 01:06:33,781
I buried my brother-in-law,
before that my da and my two cousins.

710
01:06:33,864 --> 01:06:37,243
We spilt our fair share of blood
struggling for united Ireland,

711
01:06:37,326 --> 01:06:39,370
not profiting off a divided one.

712
01:06:39,453 --> 01:06:42,540
So, don't fucking go asking me again
if I've forgotten what we're fighting for.

713
01:06:42,623 --> 01:06:45,042
If there's anyone profiteering
around here, it's you,

714
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:49,630
sitting in your fancy houses,
cozying up to the Brits.

715
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:52,049
You're not the Liam I once knew.

716
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:53,634
You want the old me, huh?

717
01:06:53,884 --> 01:06:56,554
The Butcher of the Bogside,
is that what you want?

718
01:06:56,637 --> 01:06:57,805
Well then, hear this.

719
01:06:57,888 --> 01:07:00,057
You reel in those fuckin' cunts
and end it,

720
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:02,810
or by God, I'll bury the lot of yas.

721
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:07,815
Right. I'm going now.

722
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:09,859
I'll be at my farm if you need me.

723
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:13,487
And take care of that Committee issue.

724
01:07:13,571 --> 01:07:17,908
We don't want them jumping to the wrong
conclusion about that Semtex. Do we?

725
01:07:24,165 --> 01:07:25,416
Yeah.

726
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:32,298
Do you or any of the men know
where Mary's staying in London?

727
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:34,300
No. No one, but Murphy.

728
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:36,844
Hmm. McGrath knows where she's hiding.

729
01:07:37,970 --> 01:07:39,597
I wanna know how.

730
01:07:58,365 --> 01:08:01,202
What a day, Charlie.

731
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:04,789
What a day. Come on now, let's go.

732
01:08:10,294 --> 01:08:11,754
Come on, Charlie, up you get.

733
01:08:12,797 --> 01:08:13,631
Charlie.

734
01:08:45,496 --> 01:08:46,664
You killed my dog?

735
01:08:46,997 --> 01:08:49,208
Dog's fine. Just sleeping.

736
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:51,377
Sit.

737
01:09:00,302 --> 01:09:01,387
I'm wearing a bomb.

738
01:09:02,346 --> 01:09:06,642
Anyone comes in,
I touch it one, then we die.

739
01:09:06,725 --> 01:09:07,726
Now, give me the names.

740
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:11,605
They claim they're the IRA,
but I don't know who they really are.

741
01:09:11,689 --> 01:09:14,316
I'm doing everything I can
to find out who's responsible.

742
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:15,651
You're lying! Who killed my daughter?

743
01:09:15,734 --> 01:09:18,404
I'm sorry. I truly don't know yet.

744
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:27,913
The explosives the bombers use,
it's Semtex-H?

745
01:09:28,289 --> 01:09:31,667
Yes. Yes. You know about Semtex?

746
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:34,170
I know Semtex-H.

747
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:37,298
During the war,
Czechs make for the Viet Cong.

748
01:09:37,381 --> 01:09:38,674
Good for bombs and traps.

749
01:09:38,757 --> 01:09:40,593
-In Vietnam?
-Yes.

750
01:09:41,302 --> 01:09:44,096
Many American people died by Semtex-H.

751
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:47,016
Now, IRA use to kill my daughter.

752
01:09:48,267 --> 01:09:49,476
That's ironic.

753
01:09:50,728 --> 01:09:54,648
I've read your history.
We both know about war.

754
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:57,985
We've both tried to put it behind us.
You and me, we're alike.

755
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:03,407
We are nothing alike. You're nothing!
You kill women and children! Names!

756
01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:05,576
To Almighty God, I don't know!

757
01:10:05,659 --> 01:10:08,621
Wait! Wait. I've set a trap for them
when they use the next bomb.

758
01:10:08,787 --> 01:10:11,290
When they claim responsibility
for the next bombing,

759
01:10:11,373 --> 01:10:14,960
they'll use a code word,
telling the police they're IRA.

760
01:10:15,961 --> 01:10:17,880
I've changed that code word.

761
01:10:17,963 --> 01:10:20,841
So, when they use it, I'll know.

762
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:29,141
You have one day.

763
01:10:31,518 --> 01:10:33,103
What if they don't set off a bomb by then?

764
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:36,232
Twenty-four hours.

765
01:10:39,485 --> 01:10:43,364
Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus. Sweet Jesus.

766
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:47,618
We missed it the first time...

767
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:50,454
But ran a reconfiguration through RAPTOR,

768
01:10:50,537 --> 01:10:53,499
and the image's anomalies
and architecture became more apparent.

769
01:10:53,832 --> 01:10:56,669
Now there, look, the back of his hand.

770
01:10:56,752 --> 01:10:59,213
- Hmm.
- Looks like a burn or a birthmark.

771
01:10:59,546 --> 01:11:00,839
We're running comparatives now.

772
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:03,676
So, it's a bit more time,
but we'll get it.

773
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:11,225
Come on. Come on.

774
01:11:20,985 --> 01:11:21,902
OK.

775
01:11:21,986 --> 01:11:23,112
There you go.

776
01:12:28,552 --> 01:12:31,388
- Good morning, Sean. Thanks for coming.
- Are you all right?

777
01:12:31,472 --> 01:12:34,224
Well, I've been better.
There's been another bombing.

778
01:12:34,308 --> 01:12:36,643
- Yeah, I just heard.
- Aye, a London bus.

779
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:38,896
-Has Bromley phoned?
-No. Not yet.

780
01:12:39,146 --> 01:12:41,565
McGrath's on his way with some locals.
They'll give ya a hand.

781
01:12:41,857 --> 01:12:44,651
No, I don't need them. I'll handle it.

782
01:12:44,735 --> 01:12:45,736
Good man.

783
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:04,922
Hennessy.

784
01:13:05,005 --> 01:13:08,592
They called, but didn't give a code word.
What the hell's going on?

785
01:13:08,967 --> 01:13:10,511
Maybe it wasn't them.

786
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:12,971
Press Association took the call.

787
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:15,641
A man with an Irish accent said
there'd be no more fuckin' cooperation

788
01:13:15,724 --> 01:13:17,226
with the Brits and no more code words.

789
01:13:17,518 --> 01:13:20,104
He knew exactly which bus
and how much explosive was used.

790
01:13:20,187 --> 01:13:22,314
And it's been ID'd as your Semtex again.

791
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:25,818
Either someone talked,
warned them off, or you're playing me.

792
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:30,948
Only two people knew what was happening...
Myself and Morrison.

793
01:13:31,281 --> 01:13:33,325
Like I said, one of you can't be trusted.

794
01:13:33,742 --> 01:13:36,412
Send me a number where
I can reach you day or night.

795
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:39,873
I'll call the moment I have something.

796
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:41,708
It better be soon,

797
01:13:41,792 --> 01:13:44,294
or you'll feel a backlash the likes
of which you've never felt before.

798
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:50,509
A bus now.

799
01:13:50,592 --> 01:13:53,262
For God's sake,
16 dead, twice that injured.

800
01:13:53,345 --> 01:13:54,805
I'm sorry.

801
01:13:55,180 --> 01:13:57,975
I had a plan to nail the bastards.
Didn't work.

802
01:13:58,267 --> 01:14:01,019
I've just come
from Downing Street.

803
01:14:01,562 --> 01:14:02,980
The PM will consider the pardons,

804
01:14:03,063 --> 01:14:05,441
but only if you give up
the bombers immediately.

805
01:14:05,649 --> 01:14:07,860
And how in God's name do I do that?

806
01:14:07,943 --> 01:14:09,403
Find a way.

807
01:14:09,486 --> 01:14:13,157
Plans are afoot to put the paratroops
back on your streets in 48 hours.

808
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:15,033
Belfast will erupt.

809
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:17,578
You'll give the bombers
exactly what they want.

810
01:14:17,661 --> 01:14:20,497
Well, it's out of my hands now.
Call when you have something.

811
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:22,416
I'm heading for a conference
in Rome tomorrow.

812
01:14:22,499 --> 01:14:24,251
I'll have my cell at all times.

813
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:46,440
How was London? Is Mary OK?

814
01:14:47,608 --> 01:14:49,860
You said to keep an eye on her,

815
01:14:50,277 --> 01:14:52,571
and make sure she and Keri were kept safe.

816
01:14:56,408 --> 01:15:00,245
I spent some time in her hotel lobby
watching the comings and goings, you know?

817
01:15:00,621 --> 01:15:02,122
She had no idea I was there.

818
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:05,417
And your nephew turns up.

819
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:08,879
He spent two hours in her room.

820
01:15:11,131 --> 01:15:14,384
- He spent two hours in Mary's room?
- Aye.

821
01:15:14,885 --> 01:15:15,886
And after he goes,

822
01:15:17,387 --> 01:15:18,847
Mary comes down,

823
01:15:19,723 --> 01:15:21,934
and calls Hugh McGrath on the lobby phone.

824
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:45,707
It's done.

825
01:15:52,256 --> 01:15:55,842
Unless they take it apart,
there's no way to know it's been modified.

826
01:15:55,968 --> 01:15:58,178
Fuckin' brilliant. What'll set it off?

827
01:15:58,262 --> 01:15:59,471
The internal clock.

828
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:01,306
I'll input the time
once we know the flight.

829
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:03,850
There's a security conference
in Rome tomorrow.

830
01:16:03,934 --> 01:16:07,521
All the top MPs and security people are
flying there on three lunchtime flights.

831
01:16:07,604 --> 01:16:09,648
Perfect. What about our mule?

832
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:11,858
Sara just confirmed he's going.

833
01:16:12,901 --> 01:16:15,195
We then ran the burn-mark
through the database.

834
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:17,239
We got a positive hit
on a Patrick O'Reilly,

835
01:16:17,322 --> 01:16:19,032
age 29, from Belfast.

836
01:16:19,616 --> 01:16:23,078
O'Reilly had one prior for a domestic
abuse incident three years back.

837
01:16:23,161 --> 01:16:24,705
Did two months in Hydebank.

838
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:28,500
We entered O'Reilly
into the facial rec bank for matches.

839
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:29,876
We got a hit.

840
01:16:32,212 --> 01:16:35,507
That's him in a Dublin pub
with an IRA member four weeks ago.

841
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:38,760
It's a known IRA meeting place
we've had under surveillance for years.

842
01:16:42,723 --> 01:16:43,849
And the other two with him?

843
01:16:44,099 --> 01:16:45,934
I was about to get to them,
Minister.

844
01:16:46,018 --> 01:16:48,645
That and a woman we've just ID'd
at the bus explosion.

845
01:16:55,694 --> 01:16:56,653
Yes.

846
01:16:57,112 --> 01:16:58,905
Your mole's Hugh McGrath.

847
01:17:00,991 --> 01:17:02,284
Did you hear me, Hennessy?

848
01:17:03,201 --> 01:17:04,745
Are you sure now?

849
01:17:04,911 --> 01:17:05,912
Quite.

850
01:17:06,955 --> 01:17:10,375
We've ID'd the Knightsbridge bomber
as Patrick O'Reilly of Belfast.

851
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:14,212
Three weeks ago, Mr. O'Reilly was observed
meeting Hugh McGrath in a Dublin pub.

852
01:17:15,047 --> 01:17:16,882
Where's McGrath and O'Reilly now?

853
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:19,885
I don't know O'Reilly.

854
01:17:20,969 --> 01:17:22,554
I haven't seen McGrath.

855
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:24,348
Let me help you with McGrath.

856
01:17:25,557 --> 01:17:29,019
His phone's GPS puts him
52 meters south of you.

857
01:17:29,102 --> 01:17:31,396
I'm watching him coming up your drive.

858
01:17:32,314 --> 01:17:33,732
So, let's cut the shit.

859
01:17:34,608 --> 01:17:37,486
There's a Chinook airborne
right now with a 12-man team.

860
01:17:37,569 --> 01:17:41,156
They'll land on your farm in 30 minutes
to take McGrath into custody.

861
01:17:41,239 --> 01:17:44,242
I needn't tell you how that'll go,
nor how your cozy relationship with him

862
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:45,869
will sink your career...

863
01:17:46,119 --> 01:17:47,371
This time for good.

864
01:17:49,373 --> 01:17:50,374
Or?

865
01:17:50,457 --> 01:17:52,709
Question McGrath your way
and get what I need.

866
01:17:53,168 --> 01:17:54,628
Names and locations of everyone.

867
01:17:54,961 --> 01:17:57,422
You can't save him,
but maybe you can save yourself.

868
01:17:57,506 --> 01:18:00,634
Thirty minutes, get what I need,
I'll turn them around.

869
01:18:02,761 --> 01:18:03,679
Jim.

870
01:18:08,934 --> 01:18:13,271
Send McGrath's men to the trailhead,
see if Sean needs any help.

871
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:23,657
Give me your phone.

872
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:25,283
- What the hell?
- Give me your phone.

873
01:18:27,285 --> 01:18:30,080
Get your ass in that chair there,
you motherfucker.

874
01:18:31,998 --> 01:18:34,042
-A London bus, for Christ sake!
-Now hold on.

875
01:18:34,126 --> 01:18:35,419
Not even fuckin' warnings!

876
01:18:36,002 --> 01:18:37,546
Sixteen dead.

877
01:18:37,629 --> 01:18:40,340
You stabbed me in the back
and sanctioned this bloodbath

878
01:18:40,507 --> 01:18:41,883
to get your war back on.

879
01:18:41,967 --> 01:18:44,636
The plan had no balls.

880
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:46,805
This wasn't a Bombing Light campaign.

881
01:18:46,888 --> 01:18:48,849
You said hurt 'em, and hurt 'em we did.

882
01:18:48,932 --> 01:18:50,642
By killing women and children?

883
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:53,478
You can't restrain yourself.

884
01:18:53,687 --> 01:18:55,313
You never could. Well, it's over.

885
01:18:56,815 --> 01:18:59,317
Their names, aliases, and location.

886
01:18:59,401 --> 01:19:02,904
You know I can't do that.

887
01:19:03,071 --> 01:19:04,823
That's me being nice.

888
01:19:04,906 --> 01:19:07,451
Now write. And it better match
what I already know.

889
01:19:07,534 --> 01:19:11,204
By God, I'll take you apart
joint by joint!

890
01:19:11,913 --> 01:19:13,415
You used me.

891
01:19:13,665 --> 01:19:17,169
You wanted the pardons
for your own political gain.

892
01:19:17,252 --> 01:19:19,296
You're a disgrace to the cause.

893
01:19:22,048 --> 01:19:23,341
Four men and a woman.

894
01:19:27,929 --> 01:19:29,264
Maggie Dunn?

895
01:19:29,473 --> 01:19:32,434
Aye. You call her that.

896
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:35,562
Sara Mackay's her real name.

897
01:19:38,398 --> 01:19:39,816
She works for you?

898
01:19:40,692 --> 01:19:42,235
Bloody right.

899
01:19:42,319 --> 01:19:43,653
Checks and balances.

900
01:19:47,282 --> 01:19:52,454
An insurance policy,
in case you lose your nerve,

901
01:19:52,537 --> 01:19:56,374
which you have.
So now, if they take the lads,

902
01:19:57,292 --> 01:20:00,420
she will lead them straight back to you.

903
01:20:01,046 --> 01:20:03,215
Not so easy anymore now, is it?

904
01:20:03,632 --> 01:20:06,927
SO15 will be here
in 20 minutes to take you in.

905
01:20:07,886 --> 01:20:09,805
We both know that can't happen.

906
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:15,227
You gave me up to the Brits?

907
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:18,980
You tout bastard!

908
01:20:19,064 --> 01:20:20,649
You gave yourself up.

909
01:20:21,441 --> 01:20:25,153
They've got surveillance of you
in an IRA pub with a Pat O'Reilly,

910
01:20:25,237 --> 01:20:27,280
who they ID'd as the Knightsbridge bomber.

911
01:20:27,531 --> 01:20:30,283
And thanks to your GPS phone,
they tracked you here.

912
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:36,456
You broke every rule, Hughie.

913
01:20:38,291 --> 01:20:42,337
And now I'm left to clean up your mess
as I have for the past 30 years.

914
01:20:47,551 --> 01:20:48,593
A final thing.

915
01:20:50,971 --> 01:20:51,888
My wife?

916
01:20:53,807 --> 01:20:54,808
What about her?

917
01:21:00,981 --> 01:21:05,610
She hates you because of her brother.

918
01:21:06,486 --> 01:21:08,113
And so she reached out to me.

919
01:21:08,321 --> 01:21:11,992
So, yes, I helped her...

920
01:21:12,826 --> 01:21:13,994
And she helped me.

921
01:21:32,470 --> 01:21:34,556
- Yes.
- Bromley.

922
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:36,975
I got your names.

923
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:48,945
Oh, shit, I'm late. I've got to go.

924
01:21:51,197 --> 01:21:52,240
Did you cum?

925
01:21:52,365 --> 01:21:55,619
No.
I'm not a three-second wonder like you.

926
01:22:40,830 --> 01:22:43,959
Well, keep wearing that shirt,
I'll be a two-second wonder.

927
01:22:44,167 --> 01:22:45,877
You're gonna have to get used to it.

928
01:22:49,464 --> 01:22:51,466
Practice, practice, practice.

929
01:23:01,893 --> 01:23:02,894
I'm close.

930
01:23:03,061 --> 01:23:07,148
McGrath confessed.
It was his op all along.

931
01:23:07,273 --> 01:23:11,987
I've got the bombers' names and location.
I'll text you the info. You may need it.

932
01:23:12,070 --> 01:23:15,323
The one that killed Quan's daughter
is Pat O'Reilly.

933
01:23:15,407 --> 01:23:17,450
He's got a burn-mark on his right hand.

934
01:23:17,534 --> 01:23:22,580
Either way, Sean, you end this, now.

935
01:23:23,039 --> 01:23:25,208
-You hear me?
-Understood.

936
01:24:59,344 --> 01:25:01,096
You know why you're still alive?

937
01:25:01,346 --> 01:25:04,265
You want the names?

938
01:25:05,308 --> 01:25:10,021
They're in the phone.
The last text, code 7741.

939
01:25:12,148 --> 01:25:14,150
Five names and their location in London.

940
01:25:15,276 --> 01:25:17,570
O'Reilly set the bomb
that killed your daughter.

941
01:25:19,030 --> 01:25:21,157
He's got a burn-mark on his right hand.

942
01:25:22,450 --> 01:25:24,202
You fought in the army.

943
01:25:24,577 --> 01:25:27,747
Iraq. Royal Irish Regiment.

944
01:25:28,998 --> 01:25:30,208
Two tours, Special Forces.

945
01:25:33,711 --> 01:25:37,090
You're Catholic,
but you fought for British. Why?

946
01:25:37,173 --> 01:25:38,716
I fought for the regiment.

947
01:25:40,301 --> 01:25:43,596
Out there, religion didn't matter.
We were all the same. That's it.

948
01:25:45,765 --> 01:25:46,933
Family?

949
01:25:47,517 --> 01:25:48,601
A brother.

950
01:25:50,395 --> 01:25:51,813
The rest have passed away.

951
01:26:32,437 --> 01:26:34,814
Come in.

952
01:26:38,943 --> 01:26:40,278
Take a seat, Sean.

953
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:47,577
Aye. You look like
you've been through the wars.

954
01:26:47,869 --> 01:26:51,206
Aye. Quan got the drop on me.

955
01:26:52,498 --> 01:26:55,168
I gave him the names,
he took my things and let me go.

956
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:57,962
When the bombers called in about the bus,

957
01:26:59,130 --> 01:27:01,257
they didn't use a code word,

958
01:27:01,507 --> 01:27:03,259
because someone tipped them off.

959
01:27:04,510 --> 01:27:08,097
Only two people knew
the reason for the code change.

960
01:27:08,848 --> 01:27:11,226
You and me.

961
01:27:11,309 --> 01:27:14,562
Liam, I didn't tell anyone. I swear.
I spoke to Bromley, and that was it.

962
01:27:15,063 --> 01:27:18,566
What if I told you I had Murphy stay

963
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:20,652
and watch Mary in London?

964
01:27:24,697 --> 01:27:26,783
My own flesh and blood.

965
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:28,159
Liam, I'm so sorry.

966
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:30,495
I don't wanna know
what happened in that room.

967
01:27:32,372 --> 01:27:36,042
All I wanna know is, what was discussed

968
01:27:36,125 --> 01:27:39,712
when your sweet Aunt Mary was with you?

969
01:27:39,796 --> 01:27:42,173
Did she say she was involved
with McGrath and the bombers?

970
01:27:42,257 --> 01:27:43,299
No. Never.

971
01:27:44,342 --> 01:27:46,302
She was upset about her brother
and kept on about that.

972
01:27:46,386 --> 01:27:48,805
When you and I were talking
about the code word, she asked about 'em,

973
01:27:48,888 --> 01:27:50,139
but she never let on about McGrath.

974
01:27:50,223 --> 01:27:52,392
Oh, so, she could hear us on the phone?

975
01:27:52,475 --> 01:27:54,811
No, it was only after our call
she mentioned the code word.

976
01:27:54,894 --> 01:27:57,480
-She thought they wouldn't be of use.
-So, she steered the conversation?

977
01:27:58,106 --> 01:27:59,607
Well, yes, I guess she did.

978
01:27:59,691 --> 01:28:02,777
Ah. A good manipulator, she is.

979
01:28:02,860 --> 01:28:04,028
So, she told the bombers?

980
01:28:04,112 --> 01:28:07,073
She told McGrath, McGrath told them.

981
01:28:07,156 --> 01:28:08,658
Thick as thieves, they were.

982
01:28:09,409 --> 01:28:12,161
She tricked the information
out of ya, Sean.

983
01:28:13,538 --> 01:28:15,290
She used you.

984
01:28:16,082 --> 01:28:17,375
-Liam, I--
-Shut up!

985
01:28:29,929 --> 01:28:31,806
Bury that pig in the sow-pen.

986
01:28:33,266 --> 01:28:35,893
And after that,
I have one final task for you.

987
01:28:37,228 --> 01:28:38,646
And when that's done...

988
01:28:41,274 --> 01:28:43,026
go back to New York, son.

989
01:29:11,929 --> 01:29:12,972
Thank you.

990
01:29:22,523 --> 01:29:25,818
Zero, this is Alpha Two.
Echo One toward target house.

991
01:29:26,444 --> 01:29:28,946
Zero. Echo One's
toward the target house. Copy.

992
01:29:29,655 --> 01:29:32,617
Echo One has entered
the target house and unsighted to me.

993
01:29:33,284 --> 01:29:36,245
Zero. Echo One is in target house
and unsighted to you. Copy.

994
01:29:36,329 --> 01:29:37,622
Thank Christ for that.

995
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:42,210
Sierra call signs. Confirm when Echo One
is complete in target house.

996
01:29:42,293 --> 01:29:43,878
Sierra Two, roger that.

997
01:29:45,505 --> 01:29:47,048
Sierra Three, roger that.

998
01:29:53,888 --> 01:29:55,181
X-Ray One on balcony.

999
01:29:59,143 --> 01:30:00,728
Echo One approaching front door.

1000
01:30:15,827 --> 01:30:16,911
How'd it go?

1001
01:30:17,912 --> 01:30:18,913
It's done.

1002
01:30:26,546 --> 01:30:29,048
I have visual. X-Ray One
and Echo One have left the room.

1003
01:30:29,132 --> 01:30:30,591
All other X-Rays remain.

1004
01:30:41,769 --> 01:30:42,937
Zero, this is Alpha Two.

1005
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:45,565
One unknown Echo and two children
entering the target house.

1006
01:30:45,731 --> 01:30:46,649
Roger that.

1007
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:10,131
He's a slobbering oaf.

1008
01:31:10,506 --> 01:31:11,424
It had to be done.

1009
01:31:12,508 --> 01:31:14,760
I had to shag him.
It was fuckin' disgusting.

1010
01:31:15,386 --> 01:31:17,430
Look, I know what you
went through. All right?

1011
01:31:17,513 --> 01:31:19,140
Do ya, Denis? Do ya really?

1012
01:31:19,849 --> 01:31:22,101
Well, maybe for the next bomb,
you can set up a gay Magistrate.

1013
01:31:22,185 --> 01:31:23,436
How would that be?

1014
01:31:24,020 --> 01:31:25,396
Taking a shower.

1015
01:31:27,857 --> 01:31:28,816
Next.

1016
01:31:48,169 --> 01:31:49,545
X-Ray One entering living room.

1017
01:31:51,464 --> 01:31:53,799
All X-Rays now complete in living room.

1018
01:31:54,592 --> 01:31:56,594
All call signs
move to your final rendezvous.

1019
01:32:36,384 --> 01:32:38,636
X-Rays and Echo complete in living room.

1020
01:32:48,646 --> 01:32:51,274
We've lost visual.
Echo One has closed the blinds.

1021
01:32:51,983 --> 01:32:53,859
Fox One, you have control.

1022
01:32:53,943 --> 01:32:55,945
Roger that. I have control.

1023
01:32:56,028 --> 01:32:57,571
Standby. Standby.

1024
01:33:01,826 --> 01:33:03,202
Stop, stop, stop!

1025
01:33:03,327 --> 01:33:04,370
Wait!

1026
01:33:11,460 --> 01:33:13,838
Sierra call signs, report what's going on.

1027
01:33:13,921 --> 01:33:16,090
I've two unknowns
at the front door. Wait.

1028
01:33:16,173 --> 01:33:18,801
Sorry for the bother,
but there's a gas leak in the building,

1029
01:33:18,884 --> 01:33:21,929
and the gas man
needs entry for an inspection.

1030
01:33:22,054 --> 01:33:25,057
Our gas works fine. There's no problem.

1031
01:33:25,891 --> 01:33:27,935
He needs to inspect
all the flats, regardless.

1032
01:33:28,019 --> 01:33:30,688
He won't take a moment,
and it is an emergency.

1033
01:33:35,192 --> 01:33:37,820
It's quite important, Mr. Upton.

1034
01:33:37,903 --> 01:33:40,531
By law, I'm allowed to use my own key.

1035
01:33:40,614 --> 01:33:43,951
All right. Just a second.

1036
01:33:56,964 --> 01:33:59,216
Come down when you're done,
and I'll take you to the next flat.

1037
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:00,968
Thank you. I will be very fast.

1038
01:34:06,724 --> 01:34:07,808
This way.

1039
01:34:30,956 --> 01:34:32,333
Can I see the boiler, please?

1040
01:34:32,416 --> 01:34:34,543
Would you mind
putting your bag on the table?

1041
01:34:41,592 --> 01:34:42,676
Open it up.

1042
01:34:54,021 --> 01:34:54,980
All right.

1043
01:35:15,835 --> 01:35:17,878
All call signs, standby, standby.

1044
01:37:00,689 --> 01:37:01,732
All call signs, go!

1045
01:37:12,910 --> 01:37:14,662
Get down! Get down!

1046
01:37:14,745 --> 01:37:17,414
Get down! Get down! Get down!

1047
01:37:19,708 --> 01:37:20,834
Room clear!

1048
01:37:25,756 --> 01:37:26,715
X-Rays down.

1049
01:37:26,799 --> 01:37:28,384
What about Echo?

1050
01:37:28,467 --> 01:37:30,010
She's alive, under control.

1051
01:37:31,470 --> 01:37:32,555
Who planned this?

1052
01:37:33,264 --> 01:37:34,348
Go fuck yourself.

1053
01:37:41,188 --> 01:37:42,815
What's this, eh? Your next bomb?

1054
01:37:42,982 --> 01:37:44,108
Go fuck yourself.

1055
01:37:49,154 --> 01:37:50,739
Talk, you rotten slag!

1056
01:37:59,248 --> 01:38:00,708
It's too late.

1057
01:38:02,376 --> 01:38:04,920
Nine minutes it blows. No time to land.

1058
01:38:05,004 --> 01:38:09,216
What's that? A plane? Which plane?

1059
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:10,509
Which plane?

1060
01:38:11,135 --> 01:38:12,553
Open her shirt.

1061
01:38:20,311 --> 01:38:21,478
This is how it works.

1062
01:38:22,896 --> 01:38:26,191
I ask questions. You answer.

1063
01:38:26,859 --> 01:38:31,864
That's right. Flight 136 to Rome.
Passenger name Ian Wood.

1064
01:38:31,947 --> 01:38:32,823
Bomb's in his laptop.

1065
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:35,367
Set to go off at 3:00 p.m. exactly.

1066
01:38:35,451 --> 01:38:38,078
Ladies and gentlemen,
please be advised.

1067
01:38:38,162 --> 01:38:41,582
Flight 136 to Rome
has been further delayed.

1068
01:38:41,665 --> 01:38:43,709
We apologize for the inconvenience.

1069
01:38:43,792 --> 01:38:46,128
Again, Flight 136 to Rome...

1070
01:38:46,211 --> 01:38:49,131
Ian Wood!
Is there an Ian Wood here?

1071
01:38:49,214 --> 01:38:51,508
Ian Wood! Ian Wood?

1072
01:38:51,592 --> 01:38:54,303
Is there an Ian Wood here? Ian Wood?

1073
01:38:55,054 --> 01:38:59,224
Ian Wood? Ian Wood? Ian Wood?

1074
01:39:00,643 --> 01:39:02,561
What's going on? What's going on?

1075
01:39:02,645 --> 01:39:04,897
They're looking for someone
named Ian Wood.

1076
01:39:04,980 --> 01:39:07,107
That's me. I'm Ian Wood.

1077
01:39:07,191 --> 01:39:08,984
Ian Wood!

1078
01:39:09,068 --> 01:39:10,110
I'm Ian Wood.

1079
01:39:11,528 --> 01:39:12,988
- Is that your laptop?
- Yeah.

1080
01:39:15,115 --> 01:39:17,076
Move! Move! Move!

1081
01:39:17,159 --> 01:39:19,953
Get down! Get down! Get down! Get down!

1082
01:39:20,412 --> 01:39:22,289
Get down! Get down!

1083
01:39:22,790 --> 01:39:24,500
Get down! Get down!

1084
01:39:24,583 --> 01:39:26,126
Move! Move!

1085
01:39:26,210 --> 01:39:27,753
Get down! Get down! Move!

1086
01:39:27,836 --> 01:39:32,341
Get outta the way! Get out!
Move here! Get out!

1087
01:39:33,884 --> 01:39:34,885
Move!

1088
01:39:55,781 --> 01:39:59,535
She said a gas man turned up
with an assault gun, a Chinaman.

1089
01:39:59,618 --> 01:40:02,913
Started shooting, killed everyone but her,
and then walked out the door.

1090
01:40:02,996 --> 01:40:04,456
She said he was a Chinaman?

1091
01:40:04,540 --> 01:40:06,500
Affirmative. About 60 years old.

1092
01:40:06,583 --> 01:40:08,335
Just got word
the device is neutralized.

1093
01:40:08,419 --> 01:40:11,588
Good work. Fox Hunt is now terminated.

1094
01:40:11,797 --> 01:40:13,382
No loose ends.

1095
01:40:13,465 --> 01:40:14,925
Understood.

1096
01:40:25,686 --> 01:40:29,106
It's Bromley. I need an AP
out to all city-district units

1097
01:40:29,189 --> 01:40:31,692
from Wapping High Street to the A1203.

1098
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:37,823
Suspect's an Asian male, 61 years of age,
five feet, eight inches, 11 stone.

1099
01:40:38,490 --> 01:40:40,367
His name's Ngoc Minh Quan.

1100
01:40:40,492 --> 01:40:43,579
He's armed
and has U.S. Special Forces training.

1101
01:40:43,662 --> 01:40:45,414
Use extreme caution.

1102
01:41:14,318 --> 01:41:15,152
Yes.

1103
01:41:15,402 --> 01:41:18,280
I was on the flight
they targeted to blow up.

1104
01:41:18,363 --> 01:41:20,157
Because of your timely information,
we stopped it.

1105
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:21,909
I wanted to thank you personally.

1106
01:41:23,494 --> 01:41:25,078
Thank God you're OK.

1107
01:41:25,537 --> 01:41:28,624
The bombers were neutralized,
even Sara McKay,

1108
01:41:29,041 --> 01:41:31,376
whom you called "Maggie."

1109
01:41:33,587 --> 01:41:37,299
She gave a reporter the bomb
that was to have been put on my flight.

1110
01:41:37,591 --> 01:41:39,760
She also carried out the bus carnage,

1111
01:41:39,885 --> 01:41:44,515
and is directly connected to you,
and McGrath.

1112
01:41:45,057 --> 01:41:47,810
We have call-pens going
to and from her off the cell tower

1113
01:41:47,893 --> 01:41:49,478
by your farm and town homes.

1114
01:41:49,561 --> 01:41:52,105
That's 250 precision locations
and activations

1115
01:41:52,189 --> 01:41:54,775
-consistent with your mutual activities.
-Katherine...

1116
01:41:54,858 --> 01:41:58,070
I've spoken to the PM.
He's agreed to keep you in office for now.

1117
01:41:58,153 --> 01:42:00,989
I'm issuing pardons
for five On-the-Runs, one is your cousin.

1118
01:42:01,073 --> 01:42:04,701
But, make no mistake,
Deputy First Minister, you are ours now.

1119
01:42:05,994 --> 01:42:07,746
I say jump, you say where.

1120
01:42:08,622 --> 01:42:10,374
You're on the next flight back to London.

1121
01:42:10,457 --> 01:42:13,502
Tomorrow you'll brief
SO15 and myself on everything you know.

1122
01:42:14,711 --> 01:42:16,296
All of it.

1123
01:43:10,142 --> 01:43:11,184
Good evening, sir.

1124
01:43:50,098 --> 01:43:51,141
How did you find me?

1125
01:43:52,893 --> 01:43:54,645
I gave you the names, like I said.

1126
01:43:58,774 --> 01:44:03,278
This woman, she's a bomber.
You lie. You plan everything.

1127
01:44:04,780 --> 01:44:06,198
For whatever it's worth...

1128
01:44:07,824 --> 01:44:10,285
I never intended to hurt your daughter

1129
01:44:11,286 --> 01:44:12,913
or any of those people.

1130
01:44:15,874 --> 01:44:17,042
Send.

1131
01:44:19,252 --> 01:44:20,253
Do it!

1132
01:44:36,228 --> 01:44:39,064
It's now on the Internet,
you and your mistress.

1133
01:44:39,815 --> 01:44:42,192
The whole world will know
you are a terrorist.

1134
01:44:44,861 --> 01:44:46,530
Good-bye, Mr. Hennessy.

1135
01:45:36,663 --> 01:45:37,706
Yes?

1136
01:45:37,789 --> 01:45:40,500
It's Landesman, sir, in S-11.
I've got him.

1137
01:45:40,584 --> 01:45:41,585
Where?

1138
01:45:41,668 --> 01:45:44,713
The Happy Peacock Takeaway.
He's returned.

1139
01:45:44,796 --> 01:45:46,465
Do I send in a team?

1140
01:45:47,883 --> 01:45:49,009
No.

1141
01:45:50,385 --> 01:45:52,387
I believe we owe this chap something.

1142
01:45:52,888 --> 01:45:56,475
Keep back for now.
Observe and report only.

1143
01:45:56,558 --> 01:45:57,559
Yes, sir.
