1
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,700
- You like it?
- All right.

2
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,160
I need to go. My dad's here.

3
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,700
- I'll see you tonight.
- Yeah.

4
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,670
This is the dress. Do you like it?

5
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,880
We've got to hurry. Everyone's going.
There's only two left in my size.

6
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,840
Come on, Dad, let's go.

7
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,600
When do I meet him?

8
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,190
His name's Chappy.

9
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,270
On the football team and very...

10
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,320
- Chubby?
- Chappy.

11
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,860
You'll meet when he picks me up
for the dance.

12
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,450
Not before?

13
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,700
Dad, you really need to go faster.

14
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,660
Will he drive you to the dance?

15
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,540
He's rented a limo.

16
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,830
So he won't drive you?

17
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,880
Limos come with drivers. So stop worrying.

18
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:19,010
It's a nice dress. You'll be very pretty.

19
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,850
I want you to like it.

20
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,660
- I'm getting out.
- No, no, no. Wait until I park.

21
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,170
Everyone's already inside.

22
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,090
Fan, careful crossing the street!

23
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,500
You stupid...

24
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,570
Metro desk, Ian Wood.

25
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,280
Listen carefully.

26
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,030
An action wing of the Authentic IRA

27
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:46,080
has just exploded a bomb
at the OBT Bank in Knightsbridge.

28
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,700
The code word is "Phoenix."

29
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,580
Britain's banks are now targets
for the Authentic IRA.

30
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:55,540
The bombings will continue as long as
Britain's financial criminal institutions

31
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:59,050
persist in their support of the illegal
occupation of Northern Ireland.

32
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,970
A bomb just went off,
an OBT Bank in Knightsbridge.

33
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,730
A group called the Authentic IRA just
phoned it in. They're claiming credit.

34
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,140
Who's the Authentic IRA?

35
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,480
No idea. Never heard of them.

36
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:19,480
Christ. There goes the Peace Accord
right back in the shit.

37
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,360
Listen up. A bank has just
been bombed in Knightsbridge.

38
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:27,120
A group calling itself
the Authentic IRA just phoned it in.

39
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,200
I want to know who they are,
who's behind them.

40
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:31,200
Call the Met, Sinn Fein,
monitor the blogs.

41
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:34,420
Is it the IRA or is it something else?
ISIS? Al-Qaeda?

42
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,500
What are you waiting for? Get over there.

43
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,720
...have asked
a number of police officials

44
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,640
for current estimates
on the dead and wounded...

45
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,740
This is a major incident
that they're treating

46
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,950
as a possible terrorist attack.

47
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:52,240
The bomb went off at exactly...

48
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,410
...4:15 GMT in Knightsbridge.

49
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,580
One theory on the cause of the blast

50
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,460
was that it may have been
a gasoline explosion underground.

51
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,460
How many? How many I get?

52
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,880
Twelve dead so far,
three times as many injured.

53
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:09,260
The explosion was centered
at the OBT Bank Branch in Knightsbridge.

54
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,050
There was no warning and police
were taken completely by surprise.

55
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,970
Fuck warnings. That'll teach 'em.

56
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,520
Any problems?

57
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,400
- No.
- We should be moving.

58
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,860
That's normal procedure.

59
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:28,610
Every cop, hotel, and landlady in London
is now looking for the Irishman.

60
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:33,370
This place is safe,
so long as we stay put.

61
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,140
Could I go to jail
if I murdered your phone?

62
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:02,730
Destruction of government property?
Absolutely.

63
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:06,400
Too bad. What's the time?

64
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,320
Almost 10:00. Ten more minutes.

65
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,030
Um, I'll miss my flight.

66
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:18,290
Let's stay here,
door locked, blinds down...

67
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,660
Room service for a week.

68
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,920
Sound good?

69
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:25,040
And your work, Deputy Minister?

70
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,420
An acute case of food poisoning.

71
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,470
You need to work on your excuses, darling.

72
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,910
Jesus Christ.

73
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:01,580
There's been an IRA bombing in London.

74
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,290
Scores dead and injured.

75
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,470
- Yes?
- Jesus, Liam.

76
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:17,930
Half the world's trying to find you.
Do you even know what's happened?

77
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:19,260
Yes, yes, yes, I heard.

78
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,680
I've been trying you for hours.
Where've you been?

79
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,480
Meetings.

80
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,560
- Meetings?
- Aye.

81
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,400
And last night?

82
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,110
You didn't come home. I was worried.

83
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:36,570
Came in late, left early.
Lot of work to catch up on.

84
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:40,290
But the guest room wasn't slept in.

85
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,910
Who said I slept?

86
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,160
Oh, cut the crap, Liam.

87
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,290
You didn't come home, plain and simple.

88
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,880
And what if I didn't!

89
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,380
Look, I've got a lot to deal with, OK?

90
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,720
So, don't wait up, and don't be worried.

91
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:57,930
Sunday is the 20th anniversary
of my brother's death.

92
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,390
Saint Mary's is dedicating
a mass to him, so...

93
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:05,350
I'll have Beth put it in the calendar, OK?
We'll talk later.

94
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,270
Oh, Jesus.

95
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:43,580
Yes, I understand
the need for swift action.

96
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,700
But until we can identify the threat,
there's not much we can do.

97
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,620
Well, you have your finger
on the pulse over there, Liam.

98
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,920
We're depending on you.

99
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,380
Anything you can provide, anything at all,
would be a tremendous help.

100
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,090
I'm meeting the Council now.

101
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:59,010
I'll shake the trees as hard
as I can and see what falls.

102
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:01,130
But, Kate, this is crucial.

103
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,760
We've managed to keep the lid on this
for 19 years now.

104
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:08,100
But there are new upstarts in the ranks
pressing for the way things were.

105
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,480
I could use something now.

106
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,230
And you know what I'm referring to.

107
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,860
The Royal Pardons.

108
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,490
I remember your list, the 40 "On-the-Runs."
Are we really back to that?

109
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,740
My cousin's on that list.

110
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,950
He hasn't even been convicted
of any paramilitary offenses.

111
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:28,660
These people are suspects
in many things, including murder.

112
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:32,040
These people are critical
to holding the peace together now.

113
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,210
A few letters of pardon
would be a small gesture.

114
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,510
We keep it quiet.

115
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,920
But knowing it's been considered,
gives me leeway

116
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,590
to press certain men
for something in return.

117
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,140
As Irish Deputy Minister,

118
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,060
you have served the British
government honorably,

119
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,770
which hasn't always been easy.

120
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:52,060
But appeasement is a dangerous thing.

121
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,400
These are longstanding issues.

122
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,360
That if addressed now
would smack of appeasement.

123
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,980
I need something, Kate.

124
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:01,400
The newer members haven't
lived the bloodshed and are easily swayed.

125
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,610
I'm trying to hold this together.

126
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,330
A gesture is all.
It would make a difference.

127
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,240
I'll consider it.

128
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,880
But I want something first,
something real.

129
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,250
Understood.

130
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,700
Hello?

131
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,910
We're closed. We open at 12:00.

132
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,830
Uh, we're looking for the owner,
a Mr. Quin Minh?

133
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,170
Quan.

134
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,800
Upstairs.

135
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,180
They were found on site,
not far from your daughter's body.

136
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,010
Can you positively identify them as hers?

137
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,060
Who did this?

138
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,690
As of now, sir, we don't know,
but we're going to find out.

139
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,730
Why my daughter?

140
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,820
Is there someone we can call

141
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,740
to come and be with you, Mr. Quan?

142
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,700
I have no more family.

143
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:41,250
These bombers, will you catch them?

144
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,170
Yes.

145
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,340
Will they get punished?

146
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,180
Yes, they certainly will.

147
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,930
We'll let ourselves out.

148
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,530
Ah, good morning, Hugh. Thanks for coming.

149
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:10,700
Been a long time, Liam.

150
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:13,490
It's been a long time, indeed.
Go on, take a chair, there.

151
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,250
All right, Hugh?

152
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,370
Now that we're all here,

153
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,210
does anyone know
who this Authentic IRA is?

154
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:25,050
Are they even part of the IRA?

155
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:30,640
Some new upstarts
or something else entirely? Hmm?

156
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,600
They're trying to undermine everything
we've achieved over the last 19 years.

157
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,020
Well, I won't have it.

158
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:40,980
They don't have the support of the people
who said no to the violence.

159
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,520
Our mandate's to uphold that choice

160
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,820
and maintain the Peace Accord
no matter what.

161
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,990
Are we in agreement?

162
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:49,860
There's a lot of support for their actions
amongst the younger ranks.

163
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,160
Hotheads.

164
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,620
Hotheads who don't remember
or know any better.

165
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,040
You were once one of those hotheads, Liam.

166
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:58,370
Aye.

167
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,920
Long ago, when it was the only way.

168
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,290
And what did it give us?

169
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,000
More graves than I care to remember.

170
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,590
This bombing rivals Omagh
with its civilian deaths.

171
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,510
It's unacceptable, anytime, anywhere!

172
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:14,760
And do you think the bombers
come from our ranks?

173
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,890
The Brits ID'd the explosive.

174
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,640
Czech-made Semtex from our dumps.

175
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,520
They also used our code word.

176
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,440
Which means they have
a contact in our command.

177
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,900
Maybe someone in this room.

178
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,160
They're trying to divide us,

179
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,790
put the Brits back on the streets again,
stir up the troubles all over again.

180
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,160
Well, I won't have it!

181
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,670
I want a complete check
of all the arms dumps here and abroad,

182
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,040
everything verified,

183
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,670
guns, Semtex, the whole fuckin' lot.

184
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,760
- Jesus, you can't be serious.
- Never been more so, Patty.

185
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:53,220
We check 'em, and if something's missing,

186
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,800
we trace it back
to those who knew the location.

187
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,390
And then we deal with this internally.

188
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,020
Unless someone here's got a better idea.

189
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,730
What do we get in return?

190
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,270
Peace.

191
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,530
Is that so bad, Brennan?

192
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,820
Haven't you paid enough in family blood?

193
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:16,200
So, unless you all
want to trash what we have,

194
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,040
I need your full support and respect.

195
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,000
I want a complete list
of all the stocks within the week,

196
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:25,130
along with their locations,
and everyone who knows where they are.

197
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,210
And no fuckin' exceptions!

198
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,770
Show me.

199
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:45,980
We backtracked 47 minutes.
Clearly anticipated the CCTV.

200
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,610
He circled London for quite some time
prior to the bombing.

201
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,690
Now, this is the first
CC feed we have on him.

202
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:54,700
Heading southbound on the A413
near Wendover at 10:53 a.m.

203
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,820
We retrieved the serial number
from the bike's frame.

204
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,620
It was reported stolen
in Reading the night before.

205
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,870
The license plates were also stolen
from another bike in Reading.

206
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,580
What about phone calls?

207
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,830
Assuming that the bomb
was phone-activated,

208
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,250
we've dumped the five closest towers
to the blast zone

209
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,800
trying to ID any call terminating

210
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:13,050
at the time of the incident.

211
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,260
Sorry. Excuse me.

212
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:15,590
Yup.

213
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,390
For you.

214
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,930
- Bromley.
- He's here again, sir.

215
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,230
- The Chinese man.
- What?

216
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:26,100
The Chinaman.
It's five days in a row, now.

217
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,190
Christ. Tell him I'm busy.

218
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:30,980
I did, and he said he'd wait, again.

219
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,530
I assure you, this investigation
is our top priority, Mr. Quan.

220
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,990
And we're doing all we can
and pursuing every possible lead

221
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,330
to find those who killed your daughter.

222
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,830
But they're a difficult people to catch.

223
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,130
And it may take some time.

224
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,590
I need you to understand that.

225
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:56,260
You must catch these men,
Commander Bromley.

226
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,970
Again, it's our top priority.

227
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,850
Twenty thousand pound.

228
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:13,150
All I have for the names of the bombers.

229
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:18,860
- I'm sorry, but we can't take this.
- Then please tell me...

230
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,450
Just give me the name
of someone in the IRA.

231
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:27,000
To be clear, these are vicious men
who take pride in their atrocities.

232
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:31,130
Any attempt by you to contact them
is likely to end very badly.

233
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,500
This is our work, not yours.

234
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,880
You need to be patient.

235
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,560
How long have you been
in this country, Mr. Quan?

236
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:49,440
Since 1984. I'm a British citizen.

237
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,310
You were born in Guangxi, China.

238
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:57,240
Yes. I'm Chinese Nung.

239
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,700
I work in Saigon after the war.

240
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,280
We escaped to Singapore.

241
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,990
Then we immigrate here.

242
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,250
You had two daughters
before Fan.

243
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,250
Both killed during the escape.

244
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,250
And your wife?

245
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:14,790
Where is she now?

246
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,840
She died, giving birth to Fan.

247
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,970
I'm truly sorry for your loss.

248
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,440
But you mustn't keep coming here
on a daily basis.

249
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:35,690
It doesn't help, and diverts time
and resources from our investigation.

250
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:39,740
Do you understand?

251
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,030
Yes. I understand.

252
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,250
Thank you for seeing me,
Commander Bromley.

253
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,640
After three weeks
of investigations,

254
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,520
there's little in the way
of solid leads that I'm aware of.

255
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,770
The public is looking for reassurance.

256
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:14,560
One leading politician
who somberly may have answers,

257
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:17,570
lies uncomfortably
at the center of this storm.

258
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:20,240
We go now to an interview
I recorded earlier in Belfast

259
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,110
with Deputy Minister Liam Hennessy.

260
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,990
Deputy Minister Hennessy,

261
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:27,030
you've publicly condemned the bombings.

262
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,950
Yet, as a former leader of Sinn Fein

263
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,620
and a member of the IRA,

264
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,250
you took part in similar events years ago.

265
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:37,630
What's the essential difference between
those acts you were involved in then

266
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:39,800
and what's happened in London recently?

267
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,680
Hope. We had none,
just years of vengeance.

268
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:46,890
We needed to break the cycle,

269
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:50,100
so we committed
to a political path which lead to...

270
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,350
I've made you tea.

271
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,350
So, if you say "hope,"

272
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,770
why are these IRA men,
who come from your own ranks,

273
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,770
returning to the bombings?

274
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:04,400
I can say with reasonable certainty
that the IRA are not behind this.

275
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:07,740
They stand firmly behind
the agreement and the promises...

276
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,530
You can't be like this anymore.

277
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,160
You should eat something.

278
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,790
I'm getting you some noodles.

279
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:20,750
So, you're saying
possibly it's a financial problem

280
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,340
rather than a political one.

281
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:26,380
People look for scapegoats, for a way out.

282
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,430
And for some, they are more than happy

283
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:31,720
to resort to violence,
to upset the status quo.

284
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:42,900
Prepared for your signature.
They absolutely must be signed now.

285
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:45,530
What's the latest reaction
on social media?

286
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:47,990
Same as before. Fear and anger.

287
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,410
Anger directed at whom?

288
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:51,530
From the Prime Minister on down.

289
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,330
CNN and The Irish Times
want interviews with you.

290
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,410
You can do tonight
or tomorrow morning at 8:00.

291
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,710
Tomorrow morning by phone. What else?

292
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:00,880
You've a call waitin' on Line Two.

293
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,210
- Waiting?
- For 30 minutes now.

294
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:06,170
A Mr. Quan from London, very insistent.

295
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:09,470
- What does he want?
- His daughter was killed in the bombing.

296
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:12,640
I tried my best to console him,
but he really just wants to speak to you.

297
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,730
- He saw ya on TV.
- Oh, Christ, Beth.

298
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:18,190
Civic duty. Take it and be done.

299
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:26,240
This is Liam Hennessy. How may I help you?

300
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,660
Mr. Hennessy,
tell me who killed my daughter?

301
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:33,120
What on Earth makes you think
I know who killed your daughter?

302
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:36,250
Because, you are the First Deputy Minister

303
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:40,040
and advisor to Sinn Fein,
and a former IRA member.

304
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,750
I am truly sad for your loss, Mr. Quan.
I have a daughter myself.

305
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,840
And I condemn these acts of violence,
but I can't help you.

306
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:49,630
Then please tell me someone

307
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:53,010
who might know the names of the bombers,
someone I can talk to.

308
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:57,390
I don't have any connections
to those sorts of people. I'm sorry.

309
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,560
I don't believe you, Mr. Hennessy.

310
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,650
You are very powerful man.

311
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:05,070
Well, I work for the government
and our elected officials.

312
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:07,070
I do not work for terrorists.

313
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:11,860
IRA politics and terrorism
are different ends of the same snake.

314
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,740
Whichever end you grab,
you still grab a snake.

315
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:17,450
It makes a great deal
of difference which end you grab,

316
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,250
because one end will bite.

317
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:23,960
Again, I'm sorry for your loss, Mr. Quan.

318
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,040
Good day.

319
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:17,720
What are you doing?

320
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,560
You have to stop this.

321
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,730
This wasn't your fault.

322
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,990
I failed them.

323
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,120
What's this?

324
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:41,250
The restaurant is now yours.

325
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:45,120
You've been a good friend to me, Lam.

326
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:48,040
No more of this talk.

327
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,460
Look at me.

328
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:57,640
I'm not going home. I'm staying the night.
I will sleep on the couch.

329
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:00,260
And on Monday,
I'm taking you to see someone.

330
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:03,310
Someone to help you.
But no more of this talk. OK?

331
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:11,190
Quan!

332
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:21,430
I've been calling you
all night. Where were you?

333
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,260
What are you going to do?

334
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,520
When will you come back?

335
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,340
You have a room?

336
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:41,510
These are important documents
that we must have today.

337
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,180
Yes, I will keep trying
the sender because,

338
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:47,010
apparently there's nothing else I can do,
which I find strange

339
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,640
and certainly not the service
I've come to expect.

340
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:54,860
Yes, 329174-N for November.

341
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,360
You tell your supervisor
I'll be calling back.

342
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,570
Good day.

343
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,570
Yes? May I help you?

344
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,370
Please, I would like to
speak to Mr. Hennessy.

345
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:07,740
- And your name?
- Ngoc Minh Quan.

346
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:09,870
You're the one who's been phoning.

347
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:11,960
Yes. I phoned many times.

348
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,670
I'm afraid the Deputy Minister is busy
and won't be able to see you.

349
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,510
- I will wait.
- No, you must leave.

350
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:21,760
Best do as the lady says.

351
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,680
He's been phoning up
at all hours asking for Liam.

352
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,680
He won't take no for an answer.

353
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,800
Just groceries.

354
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:31,680
Go now, before we make ya.

355
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,690
- No. I'm wait.
- Right.

356
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,610
It's the man who's been
phoning you from London.

357
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,580
He's got a knife on him.
One of those Swiss Army types.

358
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,790
Well, take it off him.

359
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,250
Jesus, how much damage
can he do with you two around?

360
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,670
Let him be.

361
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,000
As I explained before...

362
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:00,170
...I don't know who the bombers are.

363
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:03,090
I realize you're angry,
but there's not much I can do.

364
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,720
It's also very dangerous
for you to be here.

365
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,390
People in Belfast
won't take kindly to your accusations.

366
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,890
If you do not know who they are,

367
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,690
I would like you to please find out.

368
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:24,240
I haven't been affiliated
with the IRA for 30 years.

369
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,450
When I was,
I fought hard against the violence.

370
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:29,740
I went to prison
for what I did and paid my debt.

371
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:33,290
Now I serve the politics of both sides,

372
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:35,790
trying to heal the wounds
and bridge the divide.

373
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:42,550
Again, my sincere condolences,
but there's nothing I can do.

374
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,300
What if your wife and daughter
were killed by bomb?

375
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,680
I'd do everything in my power
to get justice.

376
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:55,430
So, I've chosen you, Mr. Hennessy.

377
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,350
You will tell me who killed my child.

378
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,770
Again, I don't know.

379
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,950
You will change your mind.

380
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:13,450
Thank you for seeing me,
First Minister Hennessy.

381
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:31,070
I'm sorry, Liam. He took me by surprise.

382
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:43,540
You're OK, Beth. OK, you're OK.

383
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,340
Take her, take her.

384
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:48,010
- Murphy, have the boys check the building.
- Right.

385
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,380
Jesus.

386
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:04,060
Would you like a whiskey, Inspector?

387
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,320
No, thank you.

388
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,990
I suppose it would be a waste of time
asking who might've done this.

389
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:16,120
No one comes to mind.

390
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:21,120
Well, it appears to have been
nothing more than a warning.

391
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,460
Fortunately, it wasn't a serious bomb.

392
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:26,500
If it had been, we wouldn't
be here talking, would we?

393
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:32,260
Feel free to reach out,
should you have the unexpected urge.

394
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:36,050
I'll feed the press a gas leak story
in the meantime.

395
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,350
Fair enough. Thanks very much, Inspector.

396
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,100
Hello?

397
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:46,900
It's him.

398
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:55,870
You come to my office
and plant a fucking bomb?

399
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,330
- Have you changed your mind?
- Changed my mind?

400
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:00,490
Are you out of your fuckin' tree?

401
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,710
You have no idea who you're dealing with.

402
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,000
But you'll soon find out.

403
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,250
Give me the names.

404
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:07,880
I'll tell you what.
Let's meet face-to-face.

405
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,790
We'll settle...

406
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,300
The fuckin' wanker
threatened me and hung up.

407
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:19,220
Right. Let's check all the hotels
and guest houses.

408
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:20,760
He won't be hard to find.

409
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:24,390
Fuckin' Chinaman.

410
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:30,400
Uncle Liam? What's up?

411
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:36,660
I'll be there.

412
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:50,770
Stop! Hold it, hold it,
hold it! Don't move!

413
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:54,070
Don't move! She's wired to blow!

414
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,690
Two sets of wires
ten-foot long,

415
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:37,480
soldered to that light bulb
and covered with ground-up match heads.

416
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,110
Gives an extra kick.

417
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:42,570
Not needed, but a nice touch.

418
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:45,200
Crude, effective, and easy to spot.

419
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,870
So, he wanted us to see it.

420
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,160
Well, it wasn't in the tank,
so it wouldn't have worked.

421
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,420
He just wants you to know
he can get to ya.

422
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,960
Micky.

423
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:59,340
We found him.
A B&amp;B in Wellington Park.

424
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:01,800
- They found him.
- Grab him.

425
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:05,180
Drag him out of Belfast.
Discourage him from returning.

426
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,970
Wait for me. I'm on my way.

427
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:10,640
Hello.

428
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:12,940
I hear your office was bombed.

429
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:16,400
Hardly.
It was the toilet in the hall.

430
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:19,150
An Asian man in his 60s with a grudge.

431
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,650
It's all being taken care of.

432
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:21,860
Why'd he do it?

433
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:25,530
His child died in the bank bombing.
He thinks I know who did it.

434
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,490
He's not the only one of that mind.

435
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:31,290
- So, where are we with the pardons?
- Lots of resistance.

436
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:34,920
But, if you give us something useful,
things might turn in your favor.

437
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,750
I may have a lead. I'm pursuing it.

438
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:42,340
Well, let's hope it bears fruit.
People here want heads.

439
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,140
The dogs won't stay leashed much longer.

440
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,400
Top floor on the right.

441
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,940
Fuckin' get him!

442
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,600
Christ Almighty,
are you dumb and blind?

443
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:38,060
An old man making fools
out of the lot of you

444
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:40,850
and he's still running around
out there, for God's sake.

445
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:43,190
You are four men. Four.

446
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:45,230
We had him cornered,
then he jumped off the roof

447
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,070
and slid down like some fuckin' monkey.

448
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:48,190
What is goin' on?

449
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:53,410
Pack your bag. You're going to the farm.

450
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:55,830
Go on.

451
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:57,580
Get your things.

452
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:03,960
- You all right, Sean?
- Hi, Christy.

453
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:05,670
Go on through, he's expecting ya.

454
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:12,970
Beat ya up. Come on in
and have a drink, for God's sake.

455
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:14,600
Well, look at ya.

456
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,560
- Jesus, the place looks well.
- It's not bad, is it?

457
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,600
- No.
- You're a sight for sore eyes.

458
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,180
So, how is New York treatin' ya?

459
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:23,350
- Ah, it's cold.
- Uh-huh.

460
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:27,320
Look, Murphy filled me in, there.
That bloody Chinaman.

461
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,860
He set off a bomb in my office,

462
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:32,530
put one in my Jag, and beat the bejesus
out of Mick and Jimmy.

463
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:38,200
- Do you want me to handle him?
- No. That's Kavanagh's problem.

464
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,000
I need your help with the London bombing.

465
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:46,380
Any idea who's behind it yet?

466
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:49,670
Not at all.

467
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,970
- Well, the Yanks aren't happy, Liam.
- Mm...

468
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:54,680
Dead women and kids
all over the news.

469
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,300
Any fundraising now is impossible.

470
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:59,220
Yeah, this is not about fundraising, Sean.

471
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:01,560
I need you to go to London
and meet someone...

472
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,150
A Richard Bromley in SO15.

473
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,570
SO15?

474
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:10,900
He needs to know the bombings aren't ours,

475
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:14,110
and that we're working the problem hard,
but we need his help.

476
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,200
Why me?

477
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,120
You're a decorated Ranger
in the Royal Irish Regiment.

478
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:22,660
Bromley will respect you as much
as he's capable of respecting any of us.

479
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:27,080
Should anyone find out
that we're talking to the Brits,

480
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:30,250
to go after one of our own, rogue or not,

481
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,420
there'll be the devil to pay.

482
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:36,180
So, can I count on you, Sean...

483
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,430
to be discreet?

484
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:41,220
Of course.

485
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:28,600
Right this way, sir.

486
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:29,690
Thank you very much.

487
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:42,120
You took your time.

488
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,080
I just had to put out
the odd fire here and there.

489
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:54,340
I'll be back in a minute.

490
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:55,420
I'll be right here.

491
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:10,270
Jesus.

492
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:39,840
Mr. Morrison.

493
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,060
Commander Bromley.

494
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:49,560
- We're not responsible.
- Really?

495
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:52,560
Forensic evidence and the use
of your code word suggests otherwise.

496
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,360
It's a renegade unit.
We don't know who they are yet.

497
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,280
You're telling me
there's an active IRA unit

498
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:58,610
on the loose you know nothing about?

499
00:44:58,690 --> 00:44:59,650
Yes, I am.

500
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:01,280
And the Semtex?

501
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:03,030
They're raiding our dumps.

502
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:05,160
Dumps that were
all given up for the Accord?

503
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:07,200
And your code word?

504
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:10,250
They're being helped by someone
in our command, Belfast or Dublin.

505
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:11,870
So, what do you want, Mr. Morrison?

506
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:14,170
We've a plan.

507
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:16,670
Different codes will be given
to each member of command.

508
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,630
When the bombers claim credit
for the next attack,

509
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:20,550
you'll tell us which word they use.

510
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:22,760
Then we'll know who gave
the orders and then we end it.

511
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:24,430
Who else is involved in this plan?

512
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:25,970
Liam Hennessy.

513
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:28,520
So, you can appreciate
the need for discretion.

514
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,310
Only Liam knows
who will be given which word.

515
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:33,230
So, Hennessy will personally work with us
to take out an IRA cell?

516
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:35,560
- A rogue cell.
- Your people, nonetheless.

517
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,440
I've one condition.

518
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:44,110
When Hennessy finds the bombers,
he tells me directly.

519
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,950
Then we take them down. Not you.

520
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,660
This is non-negotiable.

521
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,020
We found some plastic bags in his room.

522
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:19,320
Based on what I saw,
he's brewed up some nitroglycerin,

523
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:22,690
mixed it with weed killer, packed it
into some plastic plumbing pipes.

524
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:24,530
How much damage can he do?

525
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:28,030
I'm guessing he's made four bombs,
each enough to blow up a lorry.

526
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:29,120
Jesus.

527
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,160
Knows what he's doing.
I've half the city looking for him.

528
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:34,790
When he surfaces in Belfast,
we'll find him.

529
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:36,960
You'll be safe here.

530
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:41,500
Aye. I wouldn't count on it.

531
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:49,840
Benny!

532
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:04,210
Jesus Christ!

533
00:50:06,290 --> 00:50:07,920
Move it! Move it!

534
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:24,140
Jesus. He roughed up Benny and Sean.
They'll be fine.

535
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,560
Get more men from Belfast.

536
00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:30,110
I've underestimated him.
It won't happen again.

537
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:44,580
It's another warning, Liam?

538
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:47,500
Aye. Nothing I can't handle.

539
00:50:47,830 --> 00:50:50,000
First Belfast, now here.

540
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:51,960
How in God's name
are you handling anything?

541
00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:53,760
The problem's being dealt with.

542
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:56,630
He is destroying our farmhouse,

543
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,680
intent on God knows what,
and you're calling it a problem?

544
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:02,890
God, you can be so pompous sometimes.

545
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:05,520
I'm leaving for London.
Gonna stay at Keri's.

546
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:06,980
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

547
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:09,480
Well, I wasn't asking for your permission.

548
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:12,480
He's hardly likely to know
about our daughter's flat, and besides,

549
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:13,990
it's you he's after, not me.

550
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:15,950
Well, the point is,
if he knows about the farmhouse,

551
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:18,660
I assume he knows about Keri's flat.

552
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:19,910
It's not worth the risk.

553
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:22,370
Well then, you're just gonna
have to handle it, like you said.

554
00:51:24,370 --> 00:51:28,000
I remember a time when you would've
dealt with this, properly,

555
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,500
and other things, too.

556
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:32,000
But those days are gone.

557
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:06,870
Weighs a bit more,
but shouldn't be noticeable.

558
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
All I'm adding is the Semtex,
a micro-chip and a few inches of wire.

559
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:12,840
It looks good.

560
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:16,760
Tricky part will be getting it through
the scanner, but, we'll find a way.

561
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:18,220
And if it's turned on?

562
00:52:19,050 --> 00:52:21,680
Shorter battery life,
but it'll work, no problem.

563
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,010
Any idea which plane yet?

564
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:26,680
No. We don't want to hit a flight
with any Irish on board.

565
00:52:26,930 --> 00:52:30,310
One in the queen's fleet'd be best.
We just need the right mule.

566
00:52:34,690 --> 00:52:36,320
Code word has changed...

567
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,650
As of tonight.

568
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:43,740
My news editor's a complete twat.

569
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:47,500
Spends as much on a pair of shoes as I get
for eight hours writing crap like this.

570
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:48,580
Makes perfect sense.

571
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:51,710
Who doesn't like a new pair of sexy shoes?

572
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:55,750
You should try a real whiskey.
Two Jamesons, single malt.

573
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:01,840
"Wife Attacks
Husband's Transgender Lover."

574
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:03,760
Some serious news you're writing there.

575
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:07,310
Well, if it pays, I'll write it.

576
00:53:07,390 --> 00:53:08,850
Beats being knee-deep
in a bloody bomb site.

577
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:12,690
- So, what do you do?
- Wealth management.

578
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,240
I'm Maggie.

579
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:24,570
Ian.

580
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:31,410
All right.
I'll call if we need more.

581
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:33,080
- Thanks, Mary.
- All right, thanks. Bye.

582
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,750
Six more men
are on their way from Belfast.

583
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:39,960
When they get here, they'll relieve
the fellas who've been up all night.

584
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,130
Is it enough to secure the farm?

585
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:44,640
Secure as it can be.
It's 20 total working two shifts.

586
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:48,640
All right. You're flying
to London today with Mary.

587
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,310
- Right, yeah.
- That's completely unnecessary.

588
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:52,980
Get her into Keri's flat,
then move them into a hotel.

589
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:54,480
I can manage this, all right?

590
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:56,060
I'll not be debating this!

591
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:58,690
Nick's gonna fill up the Jag.

592
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:00,230
You're leaving...

593
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:19,920
Take him to the hospital.

594
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:22,760
- Get Mary to the airport. Go.
- Right.

595
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:31,770
Buried nitro bomb, detonated by remote.

596
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,060
He needed a line of sight.

597
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:38,020
Those woods, that's where I'd be.

598
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:41,900
- Go.
- Sean! Mick! Get in the car.

599
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:43,150
Go, go, go!

600
00:55:04,630 --> 00:55:05,930
Come on. Go, go, go!

601
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:15,560
You guys spread out.
I'll take the high ground.

602
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:07,950
Names!

603
00:56:35,390 --> 00:56:36,930
Jesus Christ!

604
00:56:37,350 --> 00:56:39,810
One ol' man running circles
around the lot of us.

605
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:42,020
Why is it so hard?

606
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:44,980
He's ahead of us every step of the way.

607
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:46,900
We need more men.

608
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,200
We need 100 more men, at least.

609
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:52,110
And if we did that,
we'd have the whole of Belfast against us.

610
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:57,910
Bring in a tracker,
someone who knows the woods,

611
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,410
and beat him at his own game.

612
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,170
My nephew?

613
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:04,880
Aye. If you can spare him.

614
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:35,370
Come on.

615
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,210
How's Keri? Where is she?

616
00:57:45,290 --> 00:57:46,290
Out.

617
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:49,420
You're a wee bit early,
but I'm nearly ready.

618
00:57:50,090 --> 00:57:52,300
Have you a restaurant in mind?

619
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:54,090
Haven't given it much thought.

620
00:57:56,350 --> 00:57:59,430
So, what urgencies
bring my nephew all the way to London?

621
00:58:00,890 --> 00:58:02,020
A few personal matters.

622
00:58:03,350 --> 00:58:05,150
I'm glad I made the list.

623
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:10,150
Mm. I think that works.

624
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:12,110
What do you think?

625
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:39,100
You've gotta be kiddin'.

626
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:47,310
- Liam?
- Tell Bromley I'll accept his terms.

627
00:58:47,810 --> 00:58:48,940
I'll pass it on.

628
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:51,570
I've given out the code words.
Now we wait.

629
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:55,070
Quan hit us again.

630
00:58:56,030 --> 00:58:58,320
Blew up the Jag,
put Billy in the hospital.

631
00:58:58,570 --> 00:59:00,200
Kavanagh and the boys went after him.

632
00:59:00,450 --> 00:59:04,580
The wee shitey injured three more men.
Punji sticks, if you can believe that.

633
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:07,920
Liam, it sounds like he's trained.
Maybe Special Forces.

634
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,420
Which brings me to the point.

635
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:13,210
I need a tracker, Sean.
Can you give us a hand?

636
00:59:14,090 --> 00:59:16,340
- I'll take a morning flight.
- Good man.

637
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:28,850
Hey. How'd he sound?

638
00:59:30,610 --> 00:59:31,690
Worried.

639
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:34,490
He's got a lot going on.

640
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:36,740
Well, if he doesn't
find the bombers, the Accord's dead.

641
00:59:37,150 --> 00:59:38,860
And politically, so's he.

642
00:59:41,450 --> 00:59:42,910
Do you think he'll find them?

643
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:45,450
Yeah, if there's another blast.

644
00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:49,710
The code word will lead us to
who's running them.

645
00:59:49,790 --> 00:59:52,380
He's finished.
The code word won't save him.

646
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:55,880
What the Council needs is new blood...

647
00:59:56,590 --> 00:59:58,800
someone stronger, like you.

648
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:02,140
He's afraid to use his power.

649
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:05,600
He's just a washed-up old man
trying to hold onto whatever he can.

650
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:13,730
I've never forgiven him
for my brother Patrick.

651
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:16,780
Liam found out who killed him.

652
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:22,070
A UVF death squad. Four men.

653
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:27,910
I told Liam to kill them
before they got to court.

654
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,500
But he said no.

655
01:00:30,370 --> 01:00:32,710
That the time for revenge is past.

656
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:37,300
So, my Patrick is dead and buried,

657
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:40,590
and they're sitting in jail now,
all four of them,

658
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:42,890
taking classes at the open university.

659
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:48,310
It's not right. It's not.

660
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:29,430
Hugh McGrath's here.

661
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:38,480
I heard you're checking my dumps.

662
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:41,610
We're checking everyone's. No exceptions.

663
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:44,280
Four came up short. Two were yours.

664
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:46,400
Ten kilos of Semtex missing.

665
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:50,030
What in God's name are you doing?
My dumps were off-limits.

666
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:51,410
We were clear in that. Remember?

667
01:03:51,490 --> 01:03:52,740
You were at the meeting.

668
01:03:53,290 --> 01:03:55,250
If you knew they were short,
you should've handled it.

669
01:03:55,330 --> 01:03:58,920
They were in perfect order.
I checked 'em myself, and that's a fact.

670
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:04,840
Christ, Liam, so the committee
knows it's my Semtex?

671
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:12,390
Don't know who we can
trust anymore. Do we?

672
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:14,390
Trust, or fear?

673
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:17,690
In your case, mostly fear.

674
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:20,100
Simple and brutal, like my da taught me.

675
01:04:22,110 --> 01:04:26,030
Look, we have an opportunity here, Liam,
if you take the lead.

676
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:27,650
This Chinaman isn't helping matters,

677
01:04:27,740 --> 01:04:29,240
but let me get some locals
to hunt him down.

678
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:31,240
- How much do you know?
- Plenty.

679
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:33,780
Bomb in your office. Your farm. Your car.

680
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:36,830
Mary and your daughter hiding out
in a London hotel, a bloody mess, it is.

681
01:04:36,910 --> 01:04:40,250
And the men sense weakness, as do the UVF.

682
01:04:40,330 --> 01:04:44,000
You should be back in Belfast,
out in front, taking charge.

683
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:47,050
- Look, I'm no politician...
- What're you trying to say?

684
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:49,170
The bombing.

685
01:04:50,590 --> 01:04:54,100
A few quiet words of encouragement
would soothe the ranks.

686
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:55,600
"Encouragement"?

687
01:04:55,810 --> 01:04:57,350
They kill civilians by the buckets.

688
01:04:57,430 --> 01:05:01,650
They went a bit far, I know,
but they have given us real momentum.

689
01:05:01,730 --> 01:05:03,110
The Brits are on the ropes.

690
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:07,230
Jesus Christ, I said hit a few
financial targets. That's it.

691
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:09,900
No one gets hurt.
That's what we agreed to.

692
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:13,030
- You gave me your word.
- And by God, I kept it.

693
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:16,700
I don't know who they are,
don't even know who's controlling 'em.

694
01:05:16,790 --> 01:05:18,080
And that's the way it has to be.

695
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:21,210
Because, if something goes wrong,
they could trace 'em straight back to us.

696
01:05:21,290 --> 01:05:25,380
Go wrong? This wasn't the fuckin' plan.
I needed this to get our people back.

697
01:05:25,590 --> 01:05:30,050
- You and I have spent our whole lifetime...
- You don't give a shit about those men.

698
01:05:30,130 --> 01:05:32,340
You needed the bombing
to shore up the election,

699
01:05:32,430 --> 01:05:34,300
to prop up your weakness in the ranks.

700
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:39,270
Well, guess what?
In the fog o' war, plans fuckin' change.

701
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:44,480
Now, I stood by you
when you put fire into the lads.

702
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:47,690
M62, Aldershot, Mountbatten.

703
01:05:47,780 --> 01:05:49,990
You were calling for an escalation then,
right enough.

704
01:05:50,070 --> 01:05:52,320
Those days are long gone!

705
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:55,870
That's not what I heard a few months ago.

706
01:05:56,990 --> 01:06:01,790
I heard the old Liam,
a man back on track with a plan.

707
01:06:04,330 --> 01:06:07,130
You haven't forgotten
what we're fighting for, have ya?

708
01:06:07,710 --> 01:06:09,130
You question my loyalty?

709
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:14,180
I buried my brother-in-law,
before that my da and my two cousins.

710
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:17,640
We spilt our fair share of blood
struggling for united Ireland,

711
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:19,770
not profiting off a divided one.

712
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:22,940
So, don't fucking go asking me again
if I've forgotten what we're fighting for.

713
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:25,440
If there's anyone profiteering
around here, it's you,

714
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:30,030
sitting in your fancy houses,
cozying up to the Brits.

715
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:32,440
You're not the Liam I once knew.

716
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:34,030
You want the old me, huh?

717
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:36,950
The Butcher of the Bogside,
is that what you want?

718
01:06:37,030 --> 01:06:38,200
Well then, hear this.

719
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:40,450
You reel in those fuckin' cunts
and end it,

720
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:43,210
or by God, I'll bury the lot of yas.

721
01:06:45,170 --> 01:06:48,210
Right. I'm going now.

722
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:50,250
I'll be at my farm if you need me.

723
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:53,880
And take care of that Committee issue.

724
01:06:53,970 --> 01:06:58,300
We don't want them jumping to the wrong
conclusion about that Semtex. Do we?

725
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:05,810
Yeah.

726
01:07:09,940 --> 01:07:12,690
Do you or any of the men know
where Mary's staying in London?

727
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:14,700
No. No one, but Murphy.

728
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:17,240
Hmm. McGrath knows where she's hiding.

729
01:07:18,370 --> 01:07:19,990
I wanna know how.

730
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:41,600
What a day, Charlie.

731
01:07:42,810 --> 01:07:45,180
What a day. Come on now, let's go.

732
01:07:50,690 --> 01:07:52,150
Come on, Charlie, up you get.

733
01:07:53,190 --> 01:07:54,030
Charlie.

734
01:08:25,890 --> 01:08:27,060
You killed my dog?

735
01:08:27,390 --> 01:08:29,600
Dog's fine. Just sleeping.

736
01:08:30,690 --> 01:08:31,770
Sit.

737
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:41,780
I'm wearing a bomb.

738
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:47,040
Anyone comes in,
I touch it one, then we die.

739
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:48,120
Now, give me the names.

740
01:08:48,210 --> 01:08:52,000
They claim they're the IRA,
but I don't know who they really are.

741
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:54,710
I'm doing everything I can
to find out who's responsible.

742
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:56,050
You're lying! Who killed my daughter?

743
01:08:56,130 --> 01:08:58,800
I'm sorry. I truly don't know yet.

744
01:09:05,390 --> 01:09:08,310
The explosives the bombers use,
it's Semtex-H?

745
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:12,060
Yes. Yes. You know about Semtex?

746
01:09:13,110 --> 01:09:14,570
I know Semtex-H.

747
01:09:15,070 --> 01:09:17,690
During the war,
Czechs make for the Viet Cong.

748
01:09:17,780 --> 01:09:19,070
Good for bombs and traps.

749
01:09:19,150 --> 01:09:20,990
- In Vietnam?
- Yes.

750
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:24,490
Many American people died by Semtex-H.

751
01:09:24,580 --> 01:09:27,410
Now, IRA use to kill my daughter.

752
01:09:28,660 --> 01:09:29,870
That's ironic.

753
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:35,040
I've read your history.
We both know about war.

754
01:09:35,130 --> 01:09:38,380
We've both tried to put it behind us.
You and me, we're alike.

755
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:43,800
We are nothing alike. You're nothing!
You kill women and children! Names!

756
01:09:43,890 --> 01:09:45,970
To Almighty God, I don't know!

757
01:09:46,050 --> 01:09:49,020
Wait! Wait. I've set a trap for them
when they use the next bomb.

758
01:09:49,180 --> 01:09:51,690
When they claim responsibility
for the next bombing,

759
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:55,360
they'll use a code word,
telling the police they're IRA.

760
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:58,280
I've changed that code word.

761
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:01,240
So, when they use it, I'll know.

762
01:10:08,290 --> 01:10:09,540
You have one day.

763
01:10:11,910 --> 01:10:13,500
What if they don't set off a bomb by then?

764
01:10:15,290 --> 01:10:16,630
Twenty-four hours.

765
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:23,760
Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus. Sweet Jesus.

766
01:10:26,850 --> 01:10:28,010
We missed it the first time...

767
01:10:28,890 --> 01:10:30,850
But ran a reconfiguration through RAPTOR,

768
01:10:30,930 --> 01:10:33,890
and the image's anomalies
and architecture became more apparent.

769
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:37,060
Now there, look, the back of his hand.

770
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:39,610
- Hmm.
- Looks like a burn or a birthmark.

771
01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:41,230
We're running comparatives now.

772
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:44,070
So, it's a bit more time,
but we'll get it.

773
01:10:48,910 --> 01:10:51,620
Come on. Come on.

774
01:11:01,380 --> 01:11:02,300
OK.

775
01:11:02,380 --> 01:11:03,510
There you go.

776
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:11,780
- Good morning, Sean. Thanks for coming.
- Are you all right?

777
01:12:11,870 --> 01:12:14,620
Well, I've been better.
There's been another bombing.

778
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:17,040
- Yeah, I just heard.
- Aye, a London bus.

779
01:12:17,210 --> 01:12:19,290
- Has Bromley phoned?
- No. Not yet.

780
01:12:19,540 --> 01:12:21,960
McGrath's on his way with some locals.
They'll give ya a hand.

781
01:12:22,250 --> 01:12:25,050
No, I don't need them. I'll handle it.

782
01:12:25,130 --> 01:12:26,130
Good man.

783
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:45,320
Hennessy.

784
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:48,990
They called, but didn't give a code word.
What the hell's going on?

785
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:50,910
Maybe it wasn't them.

786
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:53,370
Press Association took the call.

787
01:12:53,450 --> 01:12:56,040
A man with an Irish accent said
there'd be no more fuckin' cooperation

788
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:57,620
with the Brits and no more code words.

789
01:12:57,910 --> 01:13:00,500
He knew exactly which bus
and how much explosive was used.

790
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:02,710
And it's been ID'd as your Semtex again.

791
01:13:02,790 --> 01:13:06,210
Either someone talked,
warned them off, or you're playing me.

792
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:11,340
Only two people knew what was happening...
Myself and Morrison.

793
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:13,720
Like I said, one of you can't be trusted.

794
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:16,810
Send me a number where
I can reach you day or night.

795
01:13:17,970 --> 01:13:20,270
I'll call the moment I have something.

796
01:13:20,690 --> 01:13:22,100
It better be soon,

797
01:13:22,190 --> 01:13:24,690
or you'll feel a backlash the likes
of which you've never felt before.

798
01:13:29,490 --> 01:13:30,900
A bus now.

799
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:33,660
For God's sake,
16 dead, twice that injured.

800
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:35,200
I'm sorry.

801
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:38,370
I had a plan to nail the bastards.
Didn't work.

802
01:13:38,660 --> 01:13:41,410
I've just come
from Downing Street.

803
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:43,380
The PM will consider the pardons,

804
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:45,840
but only if you give up
the bombers immediately.

805
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:48,260
And how in God's name do I do that?

806
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:49,800
Find a way.

807
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:53,550
Plans are afoot to put the paratroops
back on your streets in 48 hours.

808
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:55,430
Belfast will erupt.

809
01:13:55,510 --> 01:13:57,970
You'll give the bombers
exactly what they want.

810
01:13:58,060 --> 01:14:00,890
Well, it's out of my hands now.
Call when you have something.

811
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:02,810
I'm heading for a conference
in Rome tomorrow.

812
01:14:02,890 --> 01:14:04,650
I'll have my cell at all times.

813
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:26,840
How was London? Is Mary OK?

814
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,260
You said to keep an eye on her,

815
01:14:30,670 --> 01:14:32,970
and make sure she and Keri were kept safe.

816
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:40,640
I spent some time in her hotel lobby
watching the comings and goings, you know?

817
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:42,520
She had no idea I was there.

818
01:14:44,390 --> 01:14:45,810
And your nephew turns up.

819
01:14:47,730 --> 01:14:49,270
He spent two hours in her room.

820
01:14:51,530 --> 01:14:54,780
- He spent two hours in Mary's room?
- Aye.

821
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:56,280
And after he goes,

822
01:14:57,780 --> 01:14:59,240
Mary comes down,

823
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:02,330
and calls Hugh McGrath on the lobby phone.

824
01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:26,100
It's done.

825
01:15:32,650 --> 01:15:36,240
Unless they take it apart,
there's no way to know it's been modified.

826
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:38,570
Fuckin' brilliant. What'll set it off?

827
01:15:38,660 --> 01:15:39,870
The internal clock.

828
01:15:39,950 --> 01:15:41,700
I'll input the time
once we know the flight.

829
01:15:41,790 --> 01:15:44,250
There's a security conference
in Rome tomorrow.

830
01:15:44,330 --> 01:15:47,920
All the top MPs and security people are
flying there on three lunchtime flights.

831
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,040
Perfect. What about our mule?

832
01:15:50,790 --> 01:15:52,250
Sara just confirmed he's going.

833
01:15:53,300 --> 01:15:55,590
We then ran the burn-mark
through the database.

834
01:15:55,670 --> 01:15:57,630
We got a positive hit
on a Patrick O'Reilly,

835
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:59,430
age 29, from Belfast.

836
01:16:00,010 --> 01:16:03,470
O'Reilly had one prior for a domestic
abuse incident three years back.

837
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:05,100
Did two months in Hydebank.

838
01:16:05,730 --> 01:16:08,900
We entered O'Reilly
into the facial rec bank for matches.

839
01:16:08,980 --> 01:16:10,270
We got a hit.

840
01:16:12,610 --> 01:16:15,900
That's him in a Dublin pub
with an IRA member four weeks ago.

841
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:19,160
It's a known IRA meeting place
we've had under surveillance for years.

842
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,240
And the other two with him?

843
01:16:24,490 --> 01:16:26,330
I was about to get to them,
Minister.

844
01:16:26,410 --> 01:16:29,040
That and a woman we've just ID'd
at the bus explosion.

845
01:16:36,090 --> 01:16:37,050
Yes.

846
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:39,300
Your mole's Hugh McGrath.

847
01:16:41,390 --> 01:16:42,680
Did you hear me, Hennessy?

848
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,140
Are you sure now?

849
01:16:45,310 --> 01:16:46,310
Quite.

850
01:16:47,350 --> 01:16:50,770
We've ID'd the Knightsbridge bomber
as Patrick O'Reilly of Belfast.

851
01:16:50,850 --> 01:16:54,610
Three weeks ago, Mr. O'Reilly was observed
meeting Hugh McGrath in a Dublin pub.

852
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:57,280
Where's McGrath and O'Reilly now?

853
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:00,280
I don't know O'Reilly.

854
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:02,950
I haven't seen McGrath.

855
01:17:03,030 --> 01:17:04,740
Let me help you with McGrath.

856
01:17:05,950 --> 01:17:09,410
His phone's GPS puts him
52 meters south of you.

857
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:11,790
I'm watching him coming up your drive.

858
01:17:12,710 --> 01:17:14,130
So, let's cut the shit.

859
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,880
There's a Chinook airborne
right now with a 12-man team.

860
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:21,550
They'll land on your farm in 30 minutes
to take McGrath into custody.

861
01:17:21,630 --> 01:17:24,640
I needn't tell you how that'll go,
nor how your cozy relationship with him

862
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:26,260
will sink your career...

863
01:17:26,510 --> 01:17:27,770
This time for good.

864
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:30,770
Or?

865
01:17:30,850 --> 01:17:33,100
Question McGrath your way
and get what I need.

866
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:35,020
Names and locations of everyone.

867
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:37,820
You can't save him,
but maybe you can save yourself.

868
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:41,030
Thirty minutes, get what I need,
I'll turn them around.

869
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:44,070
Jim.

870
01:17:49,330 --> 01:17:53,670
Send McGrath's men to the trailhead,
see if Sean needs any help.

871
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:04,050
Give me your phone.

872
01:18:04,140 --> 01:18:05,680
- What the hell?
- Give me your phone.

873
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:10,480
Get your ass in that chair there,
you motherfucker.

874
01:18:12,390 --> 01:18:14,440
- A London bus, for Christ sake!
- Now hold on.

875
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:15,810
Not even fuckin' warnings!

876
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:17,940
Sixteen dead.

877
01:18:18,020 --> 01:18:20,740
You stabbed me in the back
and sanctioned this bloodbath

878
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:22,280
to get your war back on.

879
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:25,030
The plan had no balls.

880
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:27,200
This wasn't a Bombing Light campaign.

881
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:29,240
You said hurt 'em, and hurt 'em we did.

882
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:31,040
By killing women and children?

883
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:33,870
You can't restrain yourself.

884
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:35,710
You never could. Well, it's over.

885
01:18:37,210 --> 01:18:39,710
Their names, aliases, and location.

886
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:43,300
You know I can't do that.

887
01:18:43,470 --> 01:18:45,220
That's me being nice.

888
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:47,850
Now write. And it better match
what I already know.

889
01:18:47,930 --> 01:18:51,600
By God, I'll take you apart
joint by joint!

890
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:53,810
You used me.

891
01:18:54,060 --> 01:18:57,560
You wanted the pardons
for your own political gain.

892
01:18:57,650 --> 01:18:59,690
You're a disgrace to the cause.

893
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:03,740
Four men and a woman.

894
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:09,660
Maggie Dunn?

895
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:12,830
Aye. You call her that.

896
01:19:13,710 --> 01:19:15,960
Sara Mackay's her real name.

897
01:19:18,790 --> 01:19:20,210
She works for you?

898
01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:22,630
Bloody right.

899
01:19:22,710 --> 01:19:24,050
Checks and balances.

900
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:32,850
An insurance policy,
in case you lose your nerve,

901
01:19:32,930 --> 01:19:36,770
which you have.
So now, if they take the lads,

902
01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:40,820
she will lead them straight back to you.

903
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:43,610
Not so easy anymore now, is it?

904
01:19:44,030 --> 01:19:47,320
SO15 will be here
in 20 minutes to take you in.

905
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:50,200
We both know that can't happen.

906
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:55,620
You gave me up to the Brits?

907
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:59,380
You tout bastard!

908
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:01,040
You gave yourself up.

909
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:05,550
They've got surveillance of you
in an IRA pub with a Pat O'Reilly,

910
01:20:05,630 --> 01:20:07,680
who they ID'd as the Knightsbridge bomber.

911
01:20:07,930 --> 01:20:10,680
And thanks to your GPS phone,
they tracked you here.

912
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:16,850
You broke every rule, Hughie.

913
01:20:18,690 --> 01:20:22,730
And now I'm left to clean up your mess
as I have for the past 30 years.

914
01:20:27,950 --> 01:20:28,990
A final thing.

915
01:20:31,370 --> 01:20:32,280
My wife?

916
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:35,200
What about her?

917
01:20:41,380 --> 01:20:46,010
She hates you because of her brother.

918
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:48,510
And so she reached out to me.

919
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:52,390
So, yes, I helped her...

920
01:20:53,220 --> 01:20:54,390
And she helped me.

921
01:21:12,870 --> 01:21:14,950
- Yes.
- Bromley.

922
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:17,370
I got your names.

923
01:21:27,260 --> 01:21:29,340
Oh, shit, I'm late. I've got to go.

924
01:21:31,590 --> 01:21:32,640
Did you cum?

925
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:36,010
No.
I'm not a three-second wonder like you.

926
01:22:21,230 --> 01:22:24,350
Well, keep wearing that shirt,
I'll be a two-second wonder.

927
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:26,270
You're gonna have to get used to it.

928
01:22:29,860 --> 01:22:31,860
Practice, practice, practice.

929
01:22:42,290 --> 01:22:43,290
I'm close.

930
01:22:43,460 --> 01:22:47,540
McGrath confessed.
It was his op all along.

931
01:22:47,670 --> 01:22:52,380
I've got the bombers' names and location.
I'll text you the info. You may need it.

932
01:22:52,470 --> 01:22:55,720
The one that killed Quan's daughter
is Pat O'Reilly.

933
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:57,850
He's got a burn-mark on his right hand.

934
01:22:57,930 --> 01:23:02,980
Either way, Sean, you end this, now.

935
01:23:03,430 --> 01:23:05,600
- You hear me?
- Understood.

936
01:24:39,740 --> 01:24:41,490
You know why you're still alive?

937
01:24:41,740 --> 01:24:44,660
You want the names?

938
01:24:45,700 --> 01:24:50,420
They're in the phone.
The last text, code 7741.

939
01:24:52,540 --> 01:24:54,550
Five names and their location in London.

940
01:24:55,670 --> 01:24:57,970
O'Reilly set the bomb
that killed your daughter.

941
01:24:59,430 --> 01:25:01,550
He's got a burn-mark on his right hand.

942
01:25:02,850 --> 01:25:04,600
You fought in the army.

943
01:25:04,970 --> 01:25:08,140
Iraq. Royal Irish Regiment.

944
01:25:09,390 --> 01:25:10,600
Two tours, Special Forces.

945
01:25:14,110 --> 01:25:17,490
You're Catholic,
but you fought for British. Why?

946
01:25:17,570 --> 01:25:19,110
I fought for the regiment.

947
01:25:20,700 --> 01:25:23,990
Out there, religion didn't matter.
We were all the same. That's it.

948
01:25:26,160 --> 01:25:27,330
Family?

949
01:25:27,910 --> 01:25:29,000
A brother.

950
01:25:30,790 --> 01:25:32,210
The rest have passed away.

951
01:26:12,830 --> 01:26:15,210
Come in.

952
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:20,670
Take a seat, Sean.

953
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:27,970
Aye. You look like
you've been through the wars.

954
01:26:28,260 --> 01:26:31,600
Aye. Quan got the drop on me.

955
01:26:32,890 --> 01:26:35,560
I gave him the names,
he took my things and let me go.

956
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:38,360
When the bombers called in about the bus,

957
01:26:39,530 --> 01:26:41,650
they didn't use a code word,

958
01:26:41,900 --> 01:26:43,650
because someone tipped them off.

959
01:26:44,910 --> 01:26:48,490
Only two people knew
the reason for the code change.

960
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:51,620
You and me.

961
01:26:51,700 --> 01:26:54,960
Liam, I didn't tell anyone. I swear.
I spoke to Bromley, and that was it.

962
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:58,960
What if I told you I had Murphy stay

963
01:26:59,050 --> 01:27:01,050
and watch Mary in London?

964
01:27:05,090 --> 01:27:07,180
My own flesh and blood.

965
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:08,550
Liam, I'm so sorry.

966
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:10,890
I don't wanna know
what happened in that room.

967
01:27:12,770 --> 01:27:16,440
All I wanna know is, what was discussed

968
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:20,110
when your sweet Aunt Mary was with you?

969
01:27:20,190 --> 01:27:22,570
Did she say she was involved
with McGrath and the bombers?

970
01:27:22,650 --> 01:27:23,690
No. Never.

971
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:26,700
She was upset about her brother
and kept on about that.

972
01:27:26,780 --> 01:27:29,200
When you and I were talking
about the code word, she asked about 'em,

973
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:30,530
but she never let on about McGrath.

974
01:27:30,620 --> 01:27:32,790
Oh, so, she could hear us on the phone?

975
01:27:32,870 --> 01:27:35,210
No, it was only after our call
she mentioned the code word.

976
01:27:35,290 --> 01:27:37,880
- She thought they wouldn't be of use.
- So, she steered the conversation?

977
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:40,000
Well, yes, I guess she did.

978
01:27:40,090 --> 01:27:43,170
Ah. A good manipulator, she is.

979
01:27:43,260 --> 01:27:44,420
So, she told the bombers?

980
01:27:44,510 --> 01:27:47,470
She told McGrath, McGrath told them.

981
01:27:47,550 --> 01:27:49,050
Thick as thieves, they were.

982
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:52,560
She tricked the information
out of ya, Sean.

983
01:27:53,930 --> 01:27:55,690
She used you.

984
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:57,770
- Liam, I...
- Shut up!

985
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:12,200
Bury that pig in the sow-pen.

986
01:28:13,660 --> 01:28:16,290
And after that,
I have one final task for you.

987
01:28:17,620 --> 01:28:19,040
And when that's done...

988
01:28:21,670 --> 01:28:23,420
go back to New York, son.

989
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:53,370
Thank you.

990
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:06,210
Zero, this is Alpha Two.
Echo One toward target house.

991
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:09,340
Zero. Echo One's
toward the target house. Copy.

992
01:29:10,050 --> 01:29:13,010
Echo One has entered
the target house and unsighted to me.

993
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:16,640
Zero. Echo One is in target house
and unsighted to you. Copy.

994
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:18,020
Thank Christ for that.

995
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:22,610
Sierra call signs. Confirm when Echo One
is complete in target house.

996
01:29:22,690 --> 01:29:24,270
Sierra Two, roger that.

997
01:29:25,900 --> 01:29:27,440
Sierra Three, roger that.

998
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:35,580
X-Ray One on balcony.

999
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:41,120
Echo One approaching front door.

1000
01:29:56,220 --> 01:29:57,310
How'd it go?

1001
01:29:58,310 --> 01:29:59,310
It's done.

1002
01:30:06,940 --> 01:30:09,440
I have visual. X-Ray One
and Echo One have left the room.

1003
01:30:09,530 --> 01:30:10,990
All other X-Rays remain.

1004
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:23,330
Zero, this is Alpha Two.

1005
01:30:23,420 --> 01:30:25,960
One unknown Echo and two children
entering the target house.

1006
01:30:26,130 --> 01:30:27,040
Roger that.

1007
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:50,530
He's a slobbering oaf.

1008
01:30:50,900 --> 01:30:51,820
It had to be done.

1009
01:30:52,900 --> 01:30:55,160
I had to shag him.
It was fuckin' disgusting.

1010
01:30:55,780 --> 01:30:57,830
Look, I know what you
went through. All right?

1011
01:30:57,910 --> 01:30:59,540
Do ya, Denis? Do ya really?

1012
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:02,500
Well, maybe for the next bomb,
you can set up a gay Magistrate.

1013
01:31:02,580 --> 01:31:03,830
How would that be?

1014
01:31:04,420 --> 01:31:05,790
Taking a shower.

1015
01:31:08,250 --> 01:31:09,210
Next.

1016
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:29,940
X-Ray One entering living room.

1017
01:31:31,860 --> 01:31:34,190
All X-Rays now complete in living room.

1018
01:31:34,990 --> 01:31:36,990
All call signs
move to your final rendezvous.

1019
01:32:16,780 --> 01:32:19,030
X-Rays and Echo complete in living room.

1020
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:31,670
We've lost visual.
Echo One has closed the blinds.

1021
01:32:32,380 --> 01:32:34,250
Fox One, you have control.

1022
01:32:34,340 --> 01:32:36,340
Roger that. I have control.

1023
01:32:36,420 --> 01:32:37,970
Standby. Standby.

1024
01:32:42,220 --> 01:32:43,600
Stop, stop, stop!

1025
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:44,770
Wait!

1026
01:32:51,860 --> 01:32:54,230
Sierra call signs, report what's going on.

1027
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:56,490
I've two unknowns
at the front door. Wait.

1028
01:32:56,570 --> 01:32:59,200
Sorry for the bother,
but there's a gas leak in the building,

1029
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:02,320
and the gas man
needs entry for an inspection.

1030
01:33:02,450 --> 01:33:05,450
Our gas works fine. There's no problem.

1031
01:33:06,290 --> 01:33:08,330
He needs to inspect
all the flats, regardless.

1032
01:33:08,410 --> 01:33:11,080
He won't take a moment,
and it is an emergency.

1033
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:18,220
It's quite important, Mr. Upton.

1034
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:20,930
By law, I'm allowed to use my own key.

1035
01:33:21,010 --> 01:33:24,350
All right. Just a second.

1036
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:39,610
Come down when you're done,
and I'll take you to the next flat.

1037
01:33:39,700 --> 01:33:41,360
Thank you. I will be very fast.

1038
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:48,200
This way.

1039
01:34:11,350 --> 01:34:12,730
Can I see the boiler, please?

1040
01:34:12,810 --> 01:34:14,940
Would you mind
putting your bag on the table?

1041
01:34:21,990 --> 01:34:23,070
Open it up.

1042
01:34:34,420 --> 01:34:35,380
All right.

1043
01:34:56,230 --> 01:34:58,270
All call signs, standby, standby.

1044
01:36:41,080 --> 01:36:42,130
All call signs, go!

1045
01:36:53,310 --> 01:36:55,060
Get down! Get down!

1046
01:36:55,140 --> 01:36:57,810
Get down! Get down! Get down!

1047
01:37:00,100 --> 01:37:01,230
Room clear!

1048
01:37:06,150 --> 01:37:07,110
X-Rays down.

1049
01:37:07,190 --> 01:37:08,780
What about Echo?

1050
01:37:08,860 --> 01:37:10,410
She's alive, under control.

1051
01:37:11,870 --> 01:37:12,950
Who planned this?

1052
01:37:13,660 --> 01:37:14,740
Go fuck yourself.

1053
01:37:21,580 --> 01:37:23,210
What's this, eh? Your next bomb?

1054
01:37:23,380 --> 01:37:24,500
Go fuck yourself.

1055
01:37:29,550 --> 01:37:31,130
Talk, you rotten slag!

1056
01:37:39,640 --> 01:37:41,100
It's too late.

1057
01:37:42,770 --> 01:37:45,320
Nine minutes it blows. No time to land.

1058
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:49,610
What's that? A plane? Which plane?

1059
01:37:49,700 --> 01:37:50,900
Which plane?

1060
01:37:51,530 --> 01:37:52,950
Open her shirt.

1061
01:38:00,710 --> 01:38:01,870
This is how it works.

1062
01:38:03,290 --> 01:38:06,590
I ask questions. You answer.

1063
01:38:07,250 --> 01:38:12,260
That's right. Flight 136 to Rome.
Passenger name Ian Wood.

1064
01:38:12,340 --> 01:38:13,220
Bomb's in his laptop.

1065
01:38:13,640 --> 01:38:15,760
Set to go off at 3:00 p.m. exactly.

1066
01:38:15,850 --> 01:38:18,470
Ladies and gentlemen,
please be advised.

1067
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:21,980
Flight 136 to Rome
has been further delayed.

1068
01:38:22,060 --> 01:38:24,100
We apologize for the inconvenience.

1069
01:38:24,190 --> 01:38:26,520
Again, Flight 136 to Rome...

1070
01:38:26,610 --> 01:38:29,530
Ian Wood!
Is there an Ian Wood here?

1071
01:38:29,610 --> 01:38:31,900
Ian Wood! Ian Wood?

1072
01:38:31,990 --> 01:38:34,700
Is there an Ian Wood here? Ian Wood?

1073
01:38:35,450 --> 01:38:39,620
Ian Wood? Ian Wood? Ian Wood?

1074
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:42,960
What's going on? What's going on?

1075
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:45,290
They're looking for someone
named Ian Wood.

1076
01:38:45,380 --> 01:38:47,500
That's me. I'm Ian Wood.

1077
01:38:47,590 --> 01:38:49,380
Ian Wood!

1078
01:38:49,460 --> 01:38:50,510
I'm Ian Wood.

1079
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:53,380
- Is that your laptop?
- Yeah.

1080
01:38:55,510 --> 01:38:57,470
Move! Move! Move!

1081
01:38:57,550 --> 01:39:00,350
Get down! Get down! Get down! Get down!

1082
01:39:00,810 --> 01:39:02,680
Get down! Get down!

1083
01:39:03,190 --> 01:39:04,900
Get down! Get down!

1084
01:39:04,980 --> 01:39:06,520
Move! Move!

1085
01:39:06,610 --> 01:39:08,150
Get down! Get down! Move!

1086
01:39:08,230 --> 01:39:12,740
Get outta the way! Get out!
Move here! Get out!

1087
01:39:14,280 --> 01:39:15,280
Move!

1088
01:39:36,180 --> 01:39:39,930
She said a gas man turned up
with an assault gun, a Chinaman.

1089
01:39:40,010 --> 01:39:43,310
Started shooting, killed everyone but her,
and then walked out the door.

1090
01:39:43,390 --> 01:39:44,850
She said he was a Chinaman?

1091
01:39:44,940 --> 01:39:46,900
Affirmative. About 60 years old.

1092
01:39:46,980 --> 01:39:48,730
Just got word
the device is neutralized.

1093
01:39:48,810 --> 01:39:51,980
Good work. Fox Hunt is now terminated.

1094
01:39:52,190 --> 01:39:53,780
No loose ends.

1095
01:39:53,860 --> 01:39:55,320
Understood.

1096
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:09,500
It's Bromley. I need an AP
out to all city-district units

1097
01:40:09,580 --> 01:40:12,090
from Wapping High Street to the A1203.

1098
01:40:13,260 --> 01:40:18,220
Suspect's an Asian male, 61 years of age,
five feet, eight inches, 11 stone.

1099
01:40:18,890 --> 01:40:20,760
His name's Ngoc Minh Quan.

1100
01:40:20,890 --> 01:40:23,970
He's armed
and has U.S. Special Forces training.

1101
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:25,810
Use extreme caution.

1102
01:40:54,710 --> 01:40:55,550
Yes.

1103
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:58,680
I was on the flight
they targeted to blow up.

1104
01:40:58,760 --> 01:41:00,550
Because of your timely information,
we stopped it.

1105
01:41:00,640 --> 01:41:02,300
I wanted to thank you personally.

1106
01:41:03,890 --> 01:41:05,470
Thank God you're OK.

1107
01:41:05,930 --> 01:41:09,020
The bombers were neutralized,
even Sara McKay,

1108
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:11,770
whom you called "Maggie."

1109
01:41:13,980 --> 01:41:17,690
She gave a reporter the bomb
that was to have been put on my flight.

1110
01:41:17,990 --> 01:41:20,160
She also carried out the bus carnage,

1111
01:41:20,280 --> 01:41:24,910
and is directly connected to you,
and McGrath.

1112
01:41:25,450 --> 01:41:28,210
We have call-pens going
to and from her off the cell tower

1113
01:41:28,290 --> 01:41:29,870
by your farm and town homes.

1114
01:41:29,960 --> 01:41:32,500
That's 250 precision locations
and activations

1115
01:41:32,580 --> 01:41:35,170
- consistent with your mutual activities.
- Katherine...

1116
01:41:35,250 --> 01:41:38,470
I've spoken to the PM.
He's agreed to keep you in office for now.

1117
01:41:38,550 --> 01:41:41,380
I'm issuing pardons
for five On-the-Runs, one is your cousin.

1118
01:41:41,470 --> 01:41:45,100
But, make no mistake,
Deputy First Minister, you are ours now.

1119
01:41:46,390 --> 01:41:48,140
I say jump, you say where.

1120
01:41:49,020 --> 01:41:50,770
You're on the next flight back to London.

1121
01:41:50,850 --> 01:41:53,900
Tomorrow you'll brief
SO15 and myself on everything you know.

1122
01:41:55,110 --> 01:41:56,690
All of it.

1123
01:42:50,540 --> 01:42:51,580
Good evening, sir.

1124
01:43:30,490 --> 01:43:31,540
How did you find me?

1125
01:43:33,290 --> 01:43:35,040
I gave you the names, like I said.

1126
01:43:39,170 --> 01:43:43,670
This woman, she's a bomber.
You lie. You plan everything.

1127
01:43:45,180 --> 01:43:46,590
For whatever it's worth...

1128
01:43:48,220 --> 01:43:50,680
I never intended to hurt your daughter

1129
01:43:51,680 --> 01:43:53,310
or any of those people.

1130
01:43:56,270 --> 01:43:57,440
Send.

1131
01:43:59,650 --> 01:44:00,650
Do it!

1132
01:44:16,620 --> 01:44:19,460
It's now on the Internet,
you and your mistress.

1133
01:44:20,210 --> 01:44:22,590
The whole world will know
you are a terrorist.

1134
01:44:25,260 --> 01:44:26,930
Good-bye, Mr. Hennessy.

1135
01:45:17,060 --> 01:45:18,100
Yes?

1136
01:45:18,180 --> 01:45:20,900
It's Landesman, sir, in S-11.
I've got him.

1137
01:45:20,980 --> 01:45:21,980
Where?

1138
01:45:22,060 --> 01:45:25,110
The Happy Peacock Takeaway.
He's returned.

1139
01:45:25,190 --> 01:45:26,860
Do I send in a team?

1140
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:29,400
No.

1141
01:45:30,780 --> 01:45:32,780
I believe we owe this chap something.

1142
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:36,870
Keep back for now.
Observe and report only.

1143
01:45:36,950 --> 01:45:37,950
Yes, sir.
