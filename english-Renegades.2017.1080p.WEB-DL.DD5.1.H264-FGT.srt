00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:02,182
<i>- What's happening?
- Go.</i>

4
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,309
<i>Mom! Who are they?</i>

5
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:07,687
<i>I don't have time to explain it
to you now. You have to go.</i>

6
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:08,988
<i>Quick!</i>

7
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,110
<i>Mom will come after you.</i>

8
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,113
- Mama
<i>- Go. You have to go.</i>

9
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:19,741
<i>Anybody here?</i>

10
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:27,749
<i>Would you mind?</i>

11
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:28,958
<i>For sure.</i>

12
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,494
<i>- Is everything ready?
- Yes.</i>

13
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,496
<i>- Did you have any problems?
- No.</i>

<i>SARAJEVO, 1995</i>

16
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:55,900
<i>Hello. Your documents.</i>

17
00:04:59,891 --> 00:05:01,864
<i>Out!</i>

18
00:05:01,976 --> 00:05:04,158
<i>Out! Out!</i>

19
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:07,953
Hands above your head! Move!

20
00:05:11,027 --> 00:05:13,000
Your hand!

21
00:05:16,824 --> 00:05:19,298
- Hey, take it easy!
- Clothes off.

22
00:05:19,368 --> 00:05:21,453
- Like a start.
- We've had worse.

23
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,427
Now!

24
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:32,728
Yeah I, I probably should have worn
a different underwear huh?

25
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,323
Get dressed.

26
00:05:44,936 --> 00:05:48,605
Future access to the general will depend
on your handling of this interview.

27
00:05:48,606 --> 00:05:51,566
We expect his words to
be heard unedited.

28
00:05:51,567 --> 00:05:55,028
The world must see this a man
of humanity and integrity.

29
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:58,420
We are here to report what
he has to say. Word for word.

30
00:06:30,106 --> 00:06:32,997
- Shit!
- What's the odd, JP?

31
00:06:33,067 --> 00:06:36,361
These things always get wet.
Let's go old school.

32
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:38,502
Go on, we gotta move.

33
00:07:01,012 --> 00:07:03,388
All right, general, could I just
get your sound level please?

34
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:05,348
Just speak normally.

35
00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:09,283
<i>I might have you all skinned alive
once all of this is done.</i>

36
00:07:09,645 --> 00:07:10,937
Sounds good to me.

37
00:07:10,938 --> 00:07:14,789
- Hear what he just said?
- Loud and clear, it is gonna be fun.

38
00:07:18,196 --> 00:07:20,030
Clear right.

39
00:07:20,031 --> 00:07:22,087
Clear left.

40
00:07:23,493 --> 00:07:25,466
Right here.

41
00:07:27,788 --> 00:07:29,539
General Milic,

42
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,000
how do you respond to the
international community,

43
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:34,961
who say that your troops have
committed these untold atrocities?

44
00:07:34,962 --> 00:07:36,463
Simply.
Very simply.

45
00:07:36,464 --> 00:07:39,424
The people of the world
had been fed lies..

46
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:43,011
They fail to understand the consequences
of Croatia's separation...

47
00:07:43,012 --> 00:07:46,070
I am sorry, uh... General.
We lost sound.

48
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:50,157
If I may, I just need to
Uh.. Change up the battery.

49
00:07:50,311 --> 00:07:53,452
Sorry.
Won't take too long.

50
00:07:54,315 --> 00:07:57,248
Okay, great, okay.

51
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,153
How's that?

52
00:08:00,154 --> 00:08:02,336
Good to go.

53
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:19,464
Stand by.
Three, two, one, execute!

54
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:21,355
Corning steel!

55
00:08:57,712 --> 00:09:00,088
- How was interview, boys?
- Pretty boring.

56
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:02,396
Yeah the sound was great!

57
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:09,403
Let's go.

58
00:09:18,274 --> 00:09:21,248
Shit!
Down, down.

59
00:09:21,903 --> 00:09:27,004
Alright, we got a Serb boat out there.
Three, two, one, go!

60
00:09:41,255 --> 00:09:43,798
All right, get the general.
Get the bags.

61
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:46,524
Stanton, clear those stairs for us.

62
00:09:50,848 --> 00:09:52,988
Stairs clear.

63
00:09:54,644 --> 00:09:56,826
Contact left!

64
00:09:58,815 --> 00:10:00,996
Stanton, get up here!

65
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:05,876
RPG!

66
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:08,003
Stanton!

67
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,933
Last man!

68
00:10:39,897 --> 00:10:42,204
You sure?

69
00:10:43,401 --> 00:10:45,291
Always.

70
00:10:53,661 --> 00:10:57,761
- Where did you learn to drive a tank?
- Ah, it's first time, how am I doing?

71
00:11:02,211 --> 00:11:05,255
2-2 SAS, this is Formula 150.

72
00:11:05,256 --> 00:11:06,937
Copy?

73
00:11:11,721 --> 00:11:14,028
2-2 SAS, do you read?

74
00:11:14,891 --> 00:11:17,809
<i>- Yes, Formula 150, we read.</i>
- Finally!

75
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:20,701
So, we have got the package.
We're moving due east.

76
00:11:21,397 --> 00:11:23,482
Modify Exfil plan.

77
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:26,776
<i>What do you think, Formula 150?
We will have to check with command. Over.</i>

78
00:11:26,777 --> 00:11:30,363
- JP, did you ever shot one of those?
- You got a trigger, I can shoot it.

79
00:11:30,364 --> 00:11:32,254
Use the trigger.

80
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:37,009
Here we go!
Round one, ready a sec!

81
00:11:37,747 --> 00:11:39,637
RPG!

82
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:45,559
Shoot! Shoot!

83
00:11:47,882 --> 00:11:50,981
Shit, diesel reserves.
The aim's too high.

84
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:56,237
- Hit him, JP!
- Got it. I got it.

85
00:11:58,643 --> 00:12:00,783
Fuel for the fire.

86
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:07,206
I think you hit 'em.

87
00:12:17,161 --> 00:12:19,955
2-2 SAS!
What's the new extraction point?

88
00:12:19,956 --> 00:12:23,931
<i>Hold on, 150.
Still waiting on command for authorization.</i>

89
00:12:24,961 --> 00:12:27,143
Alright, we got company.

90
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,840
Authorize yourself to
land that chopper,

91
00:12:29,841 --> 00:12:32,148
we need it. Now!

92
00:12:34,303 --> 00:12:36,026
Grenade!

93
00:12:41,352 --> 00:12:44,354
<i>Negative, 150.
You are now in unsupported airspace.</i>

94
00:12:44,355 --> 00:12:45,772
<i>- Stick to the plan.</i>
- What?

95
00:12:45,773 --> 00:12:48,080
I ain't got time for this shit!

96
00:12:50,027 --> 00:12:53,669
- So where are we going?
- We're taking the scenic route.

97
00:12:58,661 --> 00:13:00,593
Incoming!

98
00:13:13,384 --> 00:13:15,969
- JP, you see the comms tower?
- Yeah.

99
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,943
Bring it down!

100
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,661
Go! Go! Go!
Got him, got him!

101
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:34,919
Yes! Yes!

102
00:13:35,406 --> 00:13:37,546
All clear.

103
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,358
Boys, I got a tank in front of us.

104
00:14:02,058 --> 00:14:04,365
I got one behind this too.

105
00:14:05,728 --> 00:14:07,868
Petrovic.

106
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,622
- JP?
- Chief?

107
00:14:12,109 --> 00:14:14,236
Turn the gun at ten o'clock.

108
00:14:14,237 --> 00:14:16,919
- Hit it.
- Copy that.

109
00:14:28,793 --> 00:14:31,267
We're going for a swim, boys.

110
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:43,821
- There you go.
- Shoot them!

111
00:14:57,613 --> 00:15:00,240
So, when do you wanna go?

112
00:15:00,241 --> 00:15:02,423
When it stops raining.

113
00:15:28,603 --> 00:15:32,787
<i>Alert the patrol boat.
I want you to stop them.</i>

114
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:19,069
<i>Formula 150, we have clearance
for the alternative extraction.</i>

115
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:22,489
<i>- Formula 150, we have clearance...</i>
- Chief?

116
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:26,701
<i>I repeat, we now have clearance
for alternative extraction, over.</i>

117
00:16:26,702 --> 00:16:28,787
Are you kidding me?

118
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:31,178
You're little late, boys.

119
00:16:38,506 --> 00:16:41,605
FORWARD OPERATING BASE,
BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA

120
00:17:16,627 --> 00:17:20,728
Do you have any idea the
shit storm you've created.

121
00:17:20,965 --> 00:17:24,315
The people I have had to explain this to.

122
00:17:24,594 --> 00:17:27,220
- I believe I do, Sir.
- Who asked you?

123
00:17:27,221 --> 00:17:29,264
And no, you do not, Barnes!

124
00:17:29,265 --> 00:17:31,349
Because you don't have two
ounces of gray matter

125
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:35,103
bouncing around inside that
hollow metal on top of your shoulder.

126
00:17:35,104 --> 00:17:36,827
Okay, sir.

127
00:17:36,898 --> 00:17:39,232
Your orders, were to get in,

128
00:17:39,233 --> 00:17:42,736
secure the package, deliver
it without a footprint,

129
00:17:42,737 --> 00:17:44,919
like we were never there!

130
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:46,823
And what we get?

131
00:17:46,824 --> 00:17:51,286
A soviet era tank running roughshod
over half the goddamn city of Sarajevo,

132
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:53,747
Dead Serbs in its wake.

133
00:17:53,748 --> 00:17:57,250
And a highly uncomfortable conversation
between myself...

134
00:17:57,251 --> 00:18:00,337
and the Under Secretary of the
Joint Chief of staff.

135
00:18:00,338 --> 00:18:02,255
Sir, we were compromised.

136
00:18:02,256 --> 00:18:05,592
So, in order to protect my team and
complete the op, we had to adapt.

137
00:18:05,593 --> 00:18:10,444
And you thought driving a goddamn tank
over half of Sarajevo was the answer?

138
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:12,613
Yes, sir, I did.

139
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:15,407
You're all on leave.

140
00:18:15,686 --> 00:18:17,535
Three days.

141
00:18:17,605 --> 00:18:21,191
During which time command will decide
whether to flay your asses in public,

142
00:18:21,192 --> 00:18:23,443
for all the world to see,

143
00:18:23,444 --> 00:18:25,904
or maybe just do it here,
privately,

144
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:28,462
so only we get to enjoy it.

145
00:18:29,617 --> 00:18:31,715
Dismissed.

146
00:18:32,036 --> 00:18:34,009
Wait.

147
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,222
Almost forgot.

148
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:43,894
There's four more.

149
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:49,900
FYI, I will be having quite the
turse conversation with 22 SAS.

150
00:18:50,888 --> 00:18:53,654
Enjoy that with utmost discretion.

151
00:18:53,975 --> 00:18:56,115
Dismissed.

152
00:18:57,854 --> 00:18:59,535
Goddamn tank!

153
00:19:00,565 --> 00:19:02,274
Anyone for another drink?

154
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:05,458
Cause I...
Buy it.

155
00:19:06,487 --> 00:19:09,156
Well, this round's on me.
Cause I wanna say something.

156
00:19:09,157 --> 00:19:12,798
You are not gonna hear a word I'm saying.
Cause I can't hear myself.

157
00:19:12,827 --> 00:19:14,842
Boys!

158
00:19:15,413 --> 00:19:17,887
Shut up!
Now you shut up?

159
00:19:17,999 --> 00:19:20,764
JP, privacy.

160
00:19:28,509 --> 00:19:31,052
After that trick,
I got to say...

161
00:19:31,053 --> 00:19:33,763
Boys, here is to the
success of that mission.

162
00:19:33,764 --> 00:19:36,224
And here's to the success
of many more.

163
00:19:36,225 --> 00:19:38,300
I couldn't ask for more
from any of you boys.

164
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,508
To The team!

165
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,730
Gentlemen, start your livers.

166
00:19:41,731 --> 00:19:43,746
Already done.

167
00:19:46,527 --> 00:19:49,001
Oh, oh, Nine o' clock,
nine o' clock.

168
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,198
Gorgeous!

169
00:19:51,199 --> 00:19:52,908
Ah... Lara!

170
00:19:52,909 --> 00:19:54,576
Lara, Lara, Lara!

171
00:19:54,577 --> 00:19:58,914
I got a question for you, Lara.
Of all the guys sitting here,

172
00:19:58,915 --> 00:20:02,473
and I am including myself in these...
degenerates.

173
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:07,853
Which one of us seems most
likely to succeed... with you?

174
00:20:10,301 --> 00:20:13,025
How do you say "not you"?

175
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:18,892
- Shot down.
- Ice cold!

176
00:20:18,893 --> 00:20:22,451
And how do I say "she's perfect"?

177
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:25,732
There you go, guys.
This one is on me.

178
00:20:25,733 --> 00:20:29,319
Hey Peter, listen, your waitress, Lara.
What's the deal with her?

179
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,737
She's beautiful, no?

180
00:20:30,738 --> 00:20:34,533
Yes, she is beautiful, but she's
unreceptive to my charms.

181
00:20:34,534 --> 00:20:38,411
Well, she's real deal.
A local girl with morals.

182
00:20:38,412 --> 00:20:41,887
Oh, morals. Well, that will put
her way out of your league.

183
00:20:43,501 --> 00:20:46,753
And now I wanna know, why you are
laughing. Cause you're not even trying.

184
00:20:46,754 --> 00:20:49,311
Ben, that's because I don't try.

185
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,647
You should try it.

186
00:20:55,805 --> 00:20:58,807
Which way are we going?
Getting a kebab?

187
00:20:58,808 --> 00:21:01,532
- No, I'm full.
- Really?

188
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:04,076
Yeah, I might take a walk.

189
00:21:06,524 --> 00:21:10,666
Keep your eye out for Petrovich's guys.
He is sore a loser.

190
00:21:14,448 --> 00:21:16,589
See you bud.

191
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:38,527
My most likely to succeed.

192
00:22:01,204 --> 00:22:03,511
Is my man hungry?

193
00:22:03,623 --> 00:22:06,806
No, your man is
happy right where he is.

194
00:22:09,504 --> 00:22:11,644
I've been thinking...

195
00:22:12,256 --> 00:22:16,023
I want you to come home
with me when we are done here.

196
00:22:18,471 --> 00:22:21,014
Why do you want me to
bring me to your home?

197
00:22:21,015 --> 00:22:23,155
Because I love you.

198
00:22:24,352 --> 00:22:27,868
And because...
You've changed me.

199
00:22:28,648 --> 00:22:30,955
My future is here.

200
00:22:32,068 --> 00:22:35,362
- I can not leave my country.
- Now, Lara, it's a mess out there.

201
00:22:35,363 --> 00:22:38,114
Would you run away these terrible things
were happening in Bakers town?

202
00:22:38,115 --> 00:22:40,422
Bakersfield.

203
00:22:43,788 --> 00:22:46,929
No. No, I wouldn't.

204
00:22:51,295 --> 00:22:54,395
Some weeks ago I
started a foundation.

205
00:22:54,632 --> 00:22:57,273
And yesterday, I got official papers.

206
00:22:58,719 --> 00:23:01,861
Now I can raise money
for what my country needs.

207
00:23:02,014 --> 00:23:04,266
It's an opportunity.

208
00:23:04,267 --> 00:23:07,032
- You want to know the name?
- Sure.

209
00:23:07,103 --> 00:23:09,062
It's the Lara Civic Foundation

210
00:23:09,063 --> 00:23:12,788
for rebuilt and better Bosnia Herzegovina.

211
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:15,791
That's a long title.

212
00:23:18,573 --> 00:23:21,213
- I deserved that.
- Hmm, you do.

213
00:23:21,784 --> 00:23:24,091
You really are soft.

214
00:23:24,495 --> 00:23:26,288
Yes, I am.

215
00:23:26,289 --> 00:23:28,387
<i>Cowboy.</i>

216
00:23:37,925 --> 00:23:40,468
<i>- What is this?
- Smells good.</i>

217
00:23:40,469 --> 00:23:42,610
<i>Get out now.</i>

218
00:23:42,847 --> 00:23:44,681
<i>Yes, we will be leaving.</i>

219
00:23:44,682 --> 00:23:46,217
<i>As soon as you give us the bar.</i>

220
00:23:46,417 --> 00:23:48,894
<i>Give it up, Lara.
I will not ask for it again.</i>

221
00:23:48,895 --> 00:23:51,813
<i>You went too far Milenko.
Bringing these animals into my house.</i>

222
00:23:51,814 --> 00:23:54,497
<i>- Give it to us or we'll find it!
- Go to hell!</i>

223
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:57,583
<i>Get out! Out!</i>

224
00:23:59,822 --> 00:24:01,740
Hey... What's going on here?

225
00:24:01,741 --> 00:24:04,659
Don't mess with us, American.
We don't fight nice here.

226
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:07,384
That's okay.
Neither do I.

227
00:24:07,914 --> 00:24:09,664
Friends?

228
00:24:09,665 --> 00:24:11,847
<i>Look at this fool...</i>

229
00:24:19,926 --> 00:24:22,093
Now she gives us
what we came for,

230
00:24:22,094 --> 00:24:24,471
or your brain makes a pretty
picture right here on the floor.

231
00:24:24,472 --> 00:24:26,765
- Don't say anything, Lara.
- It's not here.

232
00:24:26,766 --> 00:24:29,476
<i>I'll show you where it is.
Just don't hurt him.</i>

233
00:24:29,477 --> 00:24:31,408
<i>He knows nothing about it.</i>

234
00:24:31,604 --> 00:24:33,786
<i>That's my girl.</i>

235
00:24:59,048 --> 00:25:01,800
Told you you should have gone
get a kebab.

236
00:25:01,801 --> 00:25:04,150
They are really good.

237
00:25:05,513 --> 00:25:07,570
This one is mine.

238
00:25:07,974 --> 00:25:11,490
- How long have you known?
- What? About you two?

239
00:25:12,812 --> 00:25:14,604
All time.

240
00:25:14,605 --> 00:25:16,912
You have not been very subtle.

241
00:25:21,154 --> 00:25:23,252
So, Lara...

242
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:29,008
Who are these guys?
Well, this one is my brother.

243
00:25:29,078 --> 00:25:31,385
The other ones I don't know.

244
00:25:32,081 --> 00:25:34,096
Well...

245
00:25:37,378 --> 00:25:41,103
You... Might wanna start
using this head.

246
00:25:41,424 --> 00:25:43,967
Trying to work out
what that's all about.

247
00:25:43,968 --> 00:25:46,150
Huh?

248
00:26:01,402 --> 00:26:03,918
.999 percent pure.

249
00:26:03,946 --> 00:26:06,420
12.4 Kilograms.

250
00:26:06,491 --> 00:26:10,660
Worth about 150,000
in your American dollars.

251
00:26:10,661 --> 00:26:12,593
Jesus!

252
00:26:12,705 --> 00:26:16,055
- Where did you get this?
- It's a long story.

253
00:26:16,167 --> 00:26:19,725
From... A long time ago.

254
00:29:25,857 --> 00:29:28,233
<i>It is my grandfather's story.</i>

255
00:29:28,234 --> 00:29:31,000
<i>One that hunted him most of his life.</i>

256
00:29:32,905 --> 00:29:34,837
<i>Anybody here?</i>

257
00:29:55,178 --> 00:29:57,971
<i>He did everything he could
to fight trouble.</i>

258
00:29:57,972 --> 00:30:01,614
<i>And when he couldn't find it,
trouble found him.</i>

259
00:30:38,346 --> 00:30:40,861
<i>Drop it, please.</i>

260
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:45,324
<i>Get that rascal,
he's got my gold!</i>

261
00:31:13,589 --> 00:31:15,521
<i>Fire!</i>

262
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:31,954
<i>Calm down, calm down!
I will help you.</i>

263
00:31:32,483 --> 00:31:35,902
<i>No! I'm not a Nazi!
Just calm down... Come on.</i>

264
00:31:35,903 --> 00:31:39,378
<i>Come, come.
I'm your friend.</i>

265
00:31:39,866 --> 00:31:42,909
<i>Will you trust me?
Would you come with me?</i>

266
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:45,968
<i>Come on.
Let's go. You first.</i>

267
00:31:50,042 --> 00:31:51,668
<i>- Everything is ready?
- All ready.</i>

268
00:31:51,669 --> 00:31:53,795
<i>- Did you have any problems?
- No.</i>

269
00:31:53,796 --> 00:31:55,561
<i>Here.</i>

270
00:32:07,894 --> 00:32:09,742
<i>Come.</i>

271
00:32:15,571 --> 00:32:17,350
<i>Hit it.</i>

272
00:33:02,198 --> 00:33:04,880
<i>It was as if GRAHOVO
never existed.</i>

273
00:33:05,201 --> 00:33:07,675
<i>In time it was forgotten.</i>

274
00:33:07,954 --> 00:33:09,996
<i>But my grandfather...</i>

275
00:33:09,997 --> 00:33:12,304
<i>he never forgot.</i>

276
00:33:28,641 --> 00:33:32,700
<i>CASA ROBLES, Vault & Safe,
Lorca SPAIN, CR 100007</i>

277
00:33:33,437 --> 00:33:35,953
People of my
town laughed at him.

278
00:33:36,107 --> 00:33:39,832
They said that he was just a crazy
old man telling made up stories.

279
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:44,503
But to me there was always something
different about this story.

280
00:33:45,658 --> 00:33:47,965
There was pain in it.

281
00:33:48,035 --> 00:33:50,912
A sadness he held inside him
the rest of his life.

282
00:33:50,913 --> 00:33:52,789
And the gold bar?

283
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:55,764
It was exactly where he
told me it would be.

284
00:33:56,085 --> 00:33:58,642
At the base of that statue.

285
00:34:00,298 --> 00:34:04,023
Can you imagine what that gold
could do to help my people?

286
00:34:06,387 --> 00:34:08,694
Will you help me get it?

287
00:34:13,394 --> 00:34:15,353
You are saying that
this is Nazi gold?

288
00:34:15,354 --> 00:34:17,772
French gold, stolen by the Nazis.

289
00:34:17,773 --> 00:34:21,874
And there's more these at the bottom of
this lake? And nobody knows it's there?

290
00:34:22,236 --> 00:34:24,738
- How many of these are down there?
- Trucks full.

291
00:34:24,739 --> 00:34:27,324
Two thousand bars, maybe more.

292
00:34:27,325 --> 00:34:30,243
- How much, Ben?
- This is about 150,000 dollars.

293
00:34:30,244 --> 00:34:33,928
Times 2 thousand bars,
300 million dollars.

294
00:34:34,957 --> 00:34:38,960
- You realize what we're talking about here?
- Recovering more than 300 million dollars

295
00:34:38,961 --> 00:34:41,421
in gold bars that nobody
seen in 50 years.

296
00:34:41,422 --> 00:34:43,381
Yeah.

297
00:34:43,382 --> 00:34:47,636
Under 150 feet of water.
Right in the middle of enemy territory.

298
00:34:47,637 --> 00:34:51,445
Not to mention the logistics
for an operation like that.

299
00:34:51,641 --> 00:34:54,156
How did you even
find out about this?

300
00:34:57,021 --> 00:34:59,161
<i>- Hello Love.
- Honey.</i>

301
00:35:03,069 --> 00:35:05,320
You remember Lara, right?

302
00:35:05,321 --> 00:35:07,447
- The other night.
- From the bar.

303
00:35:07,448 --> 00:35:09,755
I remember what happened.

304
00:35:10,326 --> 00:35:12,174
Who wants wine?

305
00:35:12,995 --> 00:35:17,263
These villages here...
Wiped out. Gone.

306
00:35:17,834 --> 00:35:20,669
Those who managed to escape
live worse than animals.

307
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:23,672
Scraps of food, contaminated
water, no medical help...

308
00:35:23,673 --> 00:35:26,049
My lady, that's
why NATO is here.

309
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:28,260
- Put an end to all that.
- What happens when we all leave?

310
00:35:28,261 --> 00:35:30,095
They will have to
rebuild their lives again.

311
00:35:30,096 --> 00:35:33,723
That gold... It can build
schools, hospitals, roads.

312
00:35:33,724 --> 00:35:36,393
It will change the lives of
people who have no future.

313
00:35:36,394 --> 00:35:38,826
Let's say we're able to get the gold.

314
00:35:39,981 --> 00:35:42,524
How do I know you're
not gonna take your share,

315
00:35:42,525 --> 00:35:45,666
pack your things
and to Switzerland?

316
00:35:45,903 --> 00:35:49,364
You're asking me to
put my men at risk.

317
00:35:49,365 --> 00:35:52,339
And potentially get them killed for what?

318
00:35:52,785 --> 00:35:56,886
What guarantee do we have
that you'll do what you say?

319
00:35:57,039 --> 00:35:59,096
You're correct.

320
00:35:59,375 --> 00:36:03,058
If you do this, I can not
tell you the future.

321
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:06,645
But I can tell you
that I do not lie.

322
00:36:07,758 --> 00:36:10,316
My heart is with my country.

323
00:36:10,344 --> 00:36:12,610
In this gold I see hope.

324
00:36:12,805 --> 00:36:15,321
And hope is the only
thing we have left.

325
00:36:18,603 --> 00:36:20,576
Alright.

326
00:36:22,106 --> 00:36:24,413
Three hundred million.

327
00:36:24,442 --> 00:36:26,526
- Splits 6 ways.
- Two ways.

328
00:36:26,527 --> 00:36:29,710
- Excuse me?
- Split two ways.

329
00:36:30,448 --> 00:36:34,089
One half to you, the
other half to my people.

330
00:36:34,202 --> 00:36:36,133
50/50.

331
00:36:36,329 --> 00:36:39,053
You take it or leave it.

332
00:36:42,293 --> 00:36:44,002
We'll be risking everything.

333
00:36:44,003 --> 00:36:46,129
- Our careers...
- How about our lives?

334
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:48,381
You know, I like my life.

335
00:36:48,382 --> 00:36:52,636
Right Stakes, when you ask navy Seal,
it's wrong to even be talking about it.

336
00:36:52,637 --> 00:36:54,429
We are talking about
a major operation.

337
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:57,098
In a hot zone in which
we have no authority.

338
00:36:57,099 --> 00:36:58,271
It's just, it's crazy.

339
00:36:58,371 --> 00:37:00,435
It's too goddamn crazy to
even be considering it.

340
00:37:00,436 --> 00:37:03,522
- What if we could?
- You want to try? Be my guest.

341
00:37:03,523 --> 00:37:05,788
Stanton's right.

342
00:37:06,567 --> 00:37:08,276
What if we could?

343
00:37:08,277 --> 00:37:11,627
We've been here six months.
What have we done?

344
00:37:11,781 --> 00:37:15,339
Now this isn't a military operation,
it's a covert mop up drill.

345
00:37:15,409 --> 00:37:17,911
This is a chance to
do something extraordinary.

346
00:37:17,912 --> 00:37:20,219
To help these people.

347
00:37:20,331 --> 00:37:23,013
It's once in a lifetime
opportunity, boys.

348
00:37:23,376 --> 00:37:25,891
It's once in a million.

349
00:37:27,672 --> 00:37:29,812
So what do you say boys?

350
00:37:38,224 --> 00:37:40,531
Let me ask you something.

351
00:37:41,269 --> 00:37:44,326
You and me, all this time...

352
00:37:45,439 --> 00:37:47,746
Was it only to get the gold?

353
00:37:51,404 --> 00:37:54,545
I did choose you because
I know you can help me.

354
00:37:55,658 --> 00:37:58,591
But then... I fall for you.

355
00:38:00,037 --> 00:38:02,136
You can believe me.

356
00:38:03,374 --> 00:38:05,514
I love you.

357
00:38:08,713 --> 00:38:12,062
We are in.
All of us.

358
00:38:43,289 --> 00:38:45,596
<i>Keep looking.</i>

359
00:38:46,459 --> 00:38:48,418
According to Lara's grandfather,

360
00:38:48,419 --> 00:38:52,339
the Germans were loading the gold into
the bank before the dam blew.

361
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,016
Inside the bank is a vault made in

362
00:38:54,216 --> 00:38:55,842
Lorca, Spain, crafted in the 30s.

363
00:38:55,843 --> 00:38:58,428
That's the serial number.
Find out the kind of the steel,

364
00:38:58,429 --> 00:39:00,594
thickness, lock mechanism,
anything that's

365
00:39:00,794 --> 00:39:02,599
gonna help us bust that thing open.

366
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,727
That's the base's supply inventory.
Identify the gear we'll need.

367
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:07,187
- Figure how to borrow it.
- Done.

368
00:39:07,188 --> 00:39:10,524
There is a long wooden dock about
300 yards from our dive point.

369
00:39:10,525 --> 00:39:13,610
We'll launch from there.
We'll dive in three teams of two.

370
00:39:13,611 --> 00:39:17,948
Right. We're gonna need magnesium, burning
bars and pure O2 to cut though this steel.

371
00:39:17,949 --> 00:39:19,533
And also a generator.

372
00:39:19,534 --> 00:39:21,743
- And ten air tanks each night.
- You got 'em.

373
00:39:21,744 --> 00:39:24,079
- How many nights you're talking?
- Oh, I figure five.

374
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:27,415
We take turns dive in 10 minute intervals
to avoid decompression sickness.

375
00:39:27,416 --> 00:39:30,293
Supply cloaks are tight asses
when it comes to air tanks.

376
00:39:30,294 --> 00:39:35,549
But you know what's funny, SAS just happen
to have whole bunch of that lying around.

377
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:37,634
Assholes messed up the extract
in our last op.

378
00:39:37,635 --> 00:39:39,425
They should be more than
happy to help us out.

379
00:39:39,449 --> 00:39:41,789
If they don't, we help ourselves.

380
00:39:41,989 --> 00:39:44,198
Anybody except me
wanna know how we're gonna

381
00:39:44,398 --> 00:39:46,407
get 2,000 gold bars up out of that lake?

382
00:39:52,483 --> 00:39:53,942
What do we need?

383
00:39:53,943 --> 00:39:57,404
Batteries, thermal
lenses, burn bars...

384
00:39:57,405 --> 00:40:00,129
- Ask him for burning bars.
<i>- Electrode.</i>

385
00:40:02,023 --> 00:40:04,712
<i>They are here to help us, Mr. Kurjak.</i>

386
00:40:10,543 --> 00:40:13,058
I'll take that as a yes.

387
00:40:14,046 --> 00:40:18,606
Yeah, awesome. Alright,
so, we need twenty of them.

388
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:20,018
<i>Twenty pieces.</i>

389
00:40:27,143 --> 00:40:28,226
What's so funny?

390
00:40:28,227 --> 00:40:31,786
He asked if you Americans
plan to rob a bank.

391
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,691
So, the vault was
sophisticated for a height.

392
00:40:34,692 --> 00:40:37,569
4 inches of tempered steel over
half a meter of concrete.

393
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:39,738
JP, that'll take us
days to burn through.

394
00:40:39,739 --> 00:40:42,115
But to save money, vault
manufactures made the

395
00:40:42,116 --> 00:40:45,869
side walls that lie next to interior walls
half that thickness.

396
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:48,371
And the vault is against
the wall of the church next door.

397
00:40:48,372 --> 00:40:50,457
Alright.
So we're going that way.

398
00:40:50,458 --> 00:40:53,170
I swear to God, if we...
We get this gold out,

399
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:55,962
I'm going to put this on humanitarian use.

400
00:40:55,963 --> 00:40:58,715
- What? So are you on brewery?
- Duffy's ale House, yeah.

401
00:40:58,716 --> 00:41:00,467
- I see a Nobel Prize.
- Thank you.

402
00:41:00,468 --> 00:41:02,385
- Cheers to that.
- I am not to piss on your parade...

403
00:41:02,386 --> 00:41:05,430
but if we can't find a way to get
several tons of gold out of that lake,

404
00:41:05,431 --> 00:41:08,155
- You ain't brewing shit.
- Good point.

405
00:41:24,492 --> 00:41:27,133
What the hell you
doing in here, Duffy?!

406
00:41:28,704 --> 00:41:32,847
- I just wanted to stop by for a chat, Walt.
- No, no, no.

407
00:41:33,376 --> 00:41:36,725
- You don't chat.
- Well, the shopping then.

408
00:41:38,923 --> 00:41:40,966
- Dimitri?
- My name is Sergei.

409
00:41:40,967 --> 00:41:42,843
Ah... Sergei, good!

410
00:41:42,844 --> 00:41:44,829
You're familiar with the North Atlantic

411
00:41:45,029 --> 00:41:47,472
Treaty Organization's operation,
Joint endeavor?

412
00:41:47,473 --> 00:41:50,058
- I know nothing...
- Well I do.

413
00:41:50,059 --> 00:41:51,643
More important
than your knowledge

414
00:41:51,644 --> 00:41:54,646
is your willingness
to assist the joint task force

415
00:41:54,647 --> 00:41:57,274
- in this urgent, secret mission.
- Top secret.

416
00:41:57,275 --> 00:41:59,582
Top secret?

417
00:41:59,694 --> 00:42:01,542
How can I help?

418
00:42:01,571 --> 00:42:04,879
Oh, we need a company vehicle
just for a few days.

419
00:42:04,949 --> 00:42:07,033
I would need to ask permission...

420
00:42:07,034 --> 00:42:11,663
Sergei, which part of top secret
did you fail understand?

421
00:42:11,664 --> 00:42:13,331
I mean lives are at stake.

422
00:42:13,332 --> 00:42:16,418
You would be doing people of
your country a huge service.

423
00:42:16,419 --> 00:42:18,920
I wouldn't be surprise if
you are held as a hero.

424
00:42:18,921 --> 00:42:21,270
Maybe even a medal.

425
00:42:28,139 --> 00:42:29,890
Thank you, Sergei.

426
00:42:29,891 --> 00:42:32,893
And from this point forth, you
have to deny everything.

427
00:42:32,894 --> 00:42:34,853
If anyone asks where
that vehicle is,

428
00:42:34,854 --> 00:42:37,328
Then you don't know because...?

429
00:42:40,735 --> 00:42:42,235
Because...?

430
00:42:42,236 --> 00:42:46,545
- I don't know.
- Exactly, exactly. Thank you sir.

431
00:42:52,121 --> 00:42:55,054
<i>All right, Bob.
Nice and steady, huh?</i>

432
00:42:55,166 --> 00:42:57,473
<i>OK, you can come, you can come.</i>

433
00:42:58,628 --> 00:43:02,214
- Triple 70 equipment supply company?
- Yeah that's it.

434
00:43:02,215 --> 00:43:06,760
Altoona, Pennsylvania, delighting
the customers since 1971.

435
00:43:06,761 --> 00:43:08,470
That's one.

436
00:43:08,471 --> 00:43:13,280
- Alright! Don't stay out too late, ladies.
- No we won't. Thank you.

437
00:43:34,789 --> 00:43:36,637
Alright!

438
00:43:39,085 --> 00:43:42,268
I'll grab what's left
That's a good little base, bud.

439
00:43:45,508 --> 00:43:48,232
Got any family, Mr. Matt?

440
00:43:48,678 --> 00:43:50,720
Back home?

441
00:43:50,721 --> 00:43:55,239
- No, I don't.
- You look like a family man.

442
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:57,853
I'm not.

443
00:43:57,854 --> 00:44:01,495
And now is not the time for
little talk or therapy sessions.

444
00:44:21,252 --> 00:44:24,713
Stay quite, don't
make a sound, okay?

445
00:44:24,714 --> 00:44:26,812
Stay down.

446
00:44:49,059 --> 00:44:50,448
<i>Let's go, guys!</i>

447
00:45:07,006 --> 00:45:09,480
You are okay? C'mon.

448
00:45:10,176 --> 00:45:12,942
- It's alright, you okay?
- Yeah.

449
00:45:15,097 --> 00:45:17,029
Thanks, Matt.

450
00:45:50,133 --> 00:45:52,425
<i>- What's that?
- You know very well, old man.</i>

451
00:45:52,426 --> 00:45:55,178
<i>Do you know that this can buy
your shitty dump a hundred times?</i>

452
00:45:55,179 --> 00:45:56,763
<i>So what?</i>

453
00:45:56,764 --> 00:46:00,614
<i>What am I going to do with that?
I need cash!</i>

454
00:46:04,772 --> 00:46:06,620
<i>Like this...</i>

455
00:46:12,697 --> 00:46:15,407
So, thing about gold is it's heavy.

456
00:46:15,408 --> 00:46:17,325
Each gold bar, weighs about 27 pounds.

457
00:46:17,326 --> 00:46:20,203
If there is really 2000 bars
then they're gonna weigh

458
00:46:20,204 --> 00:46:21,788
27 tonnes.

459
00:46:21,789 --> 00:46:23,628
Alright, that means we're
gonna have to make

460
00:46:23,828 --> 00:46:25,709
multiple runs to get
her all up out of there.

461
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:29,087
- So how long's that gonna take?
- No, I can get it out in one shot.

462
00:46:29,088 --> 00:46:32,229
- Hey, how did it go yesterday?
- Not good.

463
00:46:32,508 --> 00:46:35,051
Patrol boats, every 35
minutes on that lake.

464
00:46:35,052 --> 00:46:38,513
Petrovic hit on a convoy this morning,
it's a hot zone out there.

465
00:46:38,514 --> 00:46:40,807
Boys, if we get compromised,

466
00:46:40,808 --> 00:46:44,325
we do not engage,
withdraw, operation over.

467
00:46:44,353 --> 00:46:45,979
Alright, so what do you guys got?

468
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:47,799
Einstein here was about
to tell us how we're

469
00:46:47,999 --> 00:46:49,941
gonna get all the gold
out of lake at one shot.

470
00:46:49,942 --> 00:46:51,318
- Really?
- Yep.

471
00:46:51,319 --> 00:46:53,778
So, we need something
that can displace water,

472
00:46:53,779 --> 00:46:57,296
but still bear the weight of the gold
when it's at the surface.

473
00:46:58,201 --> 00:47:01,203
An cargo net,
spread out on the floor of the lake.

474
00:47:01,204 --> 00:47:03,663
So what we'll do is,
we'll have the gold right on top,

475
00:47:03,664 --> 00:47:06,416
then we take four small lifting
bags on each corner,

476
00:47:06,417 --> 00:47:07,790
raise them till we gather to a point

477
00:47:07,814 --> 00:47:09,211
where we can add a
very large lifting bag,

478
00:47:09,212 --> 00:47:11,213
but it's not enough.

479
00:47:11,214 --> 00:47:16,398
We'll have to do, straight over the top,
a cargo parachute, the more volume.

480
00:47:19,555 --> 00:47:21,598
Add a little bit of air and...

481
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,725
- Straight up to the surface.
- Strong enough?

482
00:47:23,726 --> 00:47:25,574
Yeah, it's a Kevlar weave,
yeah, plenty of strong.

483
00:47:25,598 --> 00:47:26,359
It's brilliant.

484
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:29,231
- Almost. Still a problem.
- I knew he wasn't that smart.

485
00:47:29,232 --> 00:47:33,082
That's how we get to the surface,
but how did we get on land?

486
00:47:34,403 --> 00:47:36,669
Oh... You know I got that.

487
00:47:50,336 --> 00:47:52,546
- Whoa.
- Tickle his balls.

488
00:47:55,466 --> 00:47:58,566
He calls it tickling his
balls, isn't that right, D?

489
00:48:01,639 --> 00:48:04,530
Ever consider the nuisances down there?

490
00:48:05,226 --> 00:48:08,228
Like a surface-to-air missiles?
RPG?

491
00:48:08,229 --> 00:48:10,744
No, shit like that
just bums him out.

492
00:48:30,793 --> 00:48:32,747
See that wooden dock 200 meters out?

493
00:48:32,947 --> 00:48:34,629
That's where our drop position.

494
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:36,923
What's down there that requires
you're off the books mission?

495
00:48:36,924 --> 00:48:39,857
Gold. Nazi gold.

496
00:48:40,178 --> 00:48:42,504
As much as one million
for you two to split.

497
00:48:42,704 --> 00:48:44,598
Well, that's the magic number.

498
00:48:44,599 --> 00:48:49,200
Next to flying, Detroit here simply
loves money, ain't that right, D?

499
00:48:52,106 --> 00:48:55,192
- What's the object?
- Well, you drop us here.

500
00:48:55,193 --> 00:48:59,446
Then you pick us and the gold
drop at the agreed upon time.

501
00:48:59,447 --> 00:49:01,781
We split it up and
go on merry ways.

502
00:49:01,782 --> 00:49:04,089
Sounds like good plan.

503
00:49:04,327 --> 00:49:06,786
The cargo's gonna be heavy.
Gonna be a problem?

504
00:49:06,787 --> 00:49:08,467
Not if you're sending
a super sea stallion.

505
00:49:08,653 --> 00:49:10,081
Well, you can fly one of those?

506
00:49:10,082 --> 00:49:14,002
The man can fly everything.
Stallions, Dragons, Apache...

507
00:49:14,003 --> 00:49:16,713
You fit a tail rotor
on Pamela Anderson,

508
00:49:16,714 --> 00:49:19,591
- he's gonna fly her too.
- Is that right?

509
00:49:19,592 --> 00:49:22,733
- 3 days notice is all we need.
- Good.

510
00:49:23,471 --> 00:49:28,989
Boys, we are in enemy territory.
Shit could get real hot out here.

511
00:49:41,155 --> 00:49:43,087
Where did he go?

512
00:50:35,585 --> 00:50:39,393
Alright!
How about you take me home?

513
00:50:43,634 --> 00:50:45,983
<i>That's what they gave me.</i>

514
00:50:46,637 --> 00:50:49,431
<i>- Have you ever seen them before?
- Them? Never.</i>

515
00:50:49,432 --> 00:50:52,698
<i>Just some punks...
Those are their plates.</i>

516
00:50:53,394 --> 00:50:56,535
<i>What you did is very patriotic..</i>

517
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,916
<i>A very unusual and valuable item.</i>

518
00:51:03,112 --> 00:51:05,211
<i>Where's it from?</i>

519
00:51:08,242 --> 00:51:10,549
<i>I found it.</i>

520
00:51:13,206 --> 00:51:15,930
<i>From now on, I'll
only speak to you...</i>

521
00:51:21,547 --> 00:51:24,105
<i>Now you'll tell me everything.</i>

522
00:51:26,344 --> 00:51:30,277
What about decompression?
That depth is gonna be an issue.

523
00:51:30,681 --> 00:51:33,823
- We might control the sense.
- There you are.

524
00:51:34,352 --> 00:51:37,409
Levin wants you and your
team in his office, on the double.

525
00:51:38,105 --> 00:51:41,274
Do you ladies have any idea
why you're standing here before me?

526
00:51:41,275 --> 00:51:44,583
- I have an idea, sir.
- You do not have a clue, Barnes.

527
00:51:44,695 --> 00:51:48,323
- That's what I meant to say, sir.
- Yours truly...

528
00:51:48,324 --> 00:51:52,994
and General Tobias himself
met with SAS command yesterday.

529
00:51:52,995 --> 00:51:55,914
We conducted an evaluation
of your recent operation,

530
00:51:55,915 --> 00:52:00,683
which I supervised with my
customary intelligence and thoroughness.

531
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:03,004
This investigation led to the

532
00:52:03,005 --> 00:52:06,550
determination of what many had
come to suspect about 2-2 SAS team.

533
00:52:06,551 --> 00:52:08,218
Do you know what that would be, Lieutenant?

534
00:52:08,219 --> 00:52:10,929
That we are a bunch of
crumpled munching pussies sir?

535
00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:12,653
Correcte mundo.

536
00:52:13,516 --> 00:52:16,449
Furthermore, during
the course of said review,

537
00:52:16,727 --> 00:52:20,939
the resourceful tactics and heroic
actions of this team came to light.

538
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:24,067
General Tobias was
particularly impressed.

539
00:52:24,068 --> 00:52:27,821
Please do not start waving
your tiny little penises around.

540
00:52:27,822 --> 00:52:29,948
Which reminds me,

541
00:52:29,949 --> 00:52:32,400
my arrogant little prick
of a brother-in-law

542
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,717
sent me a box of this 50 dollar cigars

543
00:52:34,745 --> 00:52:37,636
to commemorate the
occasion of my birth.

544
00:52:37,748 --> 00:52:41,001
Now, personally, I'd assume
grind one out in his eye,

545
00:52:41,002 --> 00:52:43,336
since he only does this
to flaunt his wealth,

546
00:52:43,337 --> 00:52:47,215
thereby fueling his erroneous assertion
of his own superiority.

547
00:52:47,216 --> 00:52:49,843
Classic Napoleon complex.

548
00:52:49,844 --> 00:52:52,026
But I digress.

549
00:52:53,389 --> 00:52:57,767
It seems... That a significant
number of Serb head hunters

550
00:52:57,768 --> 00:53:00,896
are actively searching to
kill you knuckleheads.

551
00:53:00,897 --> 00:53:04,274
Well sir, we welcome them to try.

552
00:53:04,275 --> 00:53:05,817
I am sure you would.

553
00:53:05,818 --> 00:53:09,126
Fortunately for them, that
opportunity will not arrive.

554
00:53:10,198 --> 00:53:12,574
Joint command wants this
whole mess to go away.

555
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:16,828
And by this whole mess I do mean
specifically the five of you.

556
00:53:16,829 --> 00:53:19,789
- Really, Sir?
- You are being redeployed.

557
00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:22,431
As far away from here
as humanely possible.

558
00:53:23,044 --> 00:53:24,836
In the meantime, you
are shipping home.

559
00:53:24,837 --> 00:53:27,506
Transport plane to Mannheim
departs in 36 hours.

560
00:53:27,507 --> 00:53:30,759
And your supremely lucky
asses will be on it.

561
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:32,886
Until then you are
remanded to base.

562
00:53:32,887 --> 00:53:34,971
With all due respect, Sir,

563
00:53:34,972 --> 00:53:40,060
we don't believe that our work here
has been fully accomplished.

564
00:53:40,061 --> 00:53:42,201
Appreciate that sentiment.

565
00:53:42,897 --> 00:53:45,913
Unfortunately, this is
above my pay grade.

566
00:53:45,942 --> 00:53:48,249
Dismissed.

567
00:53:50,947 --> 00:53:53,129
Chief, so what do you wanna to?

568
00:53:53,157 --> 00:53:56,674
What do you mean, what do I wanna do?
You heard the man.

569
00:53:57,036 --> 00:53:59,969
We're shipping out.
We're done.

570
00:54:00,373 --> 00:54:03,514
Pack your things.
Let's get drunk.

571
00:54:43,457 --> 00:54:45,389
I'm sorry, Stanton.

572
00:54:46,919 --> 00:54:49,894
I know you really wanted to
do this for her.

573
00:54:55,094 --> 00:54:57,276
You love her, don't you?

574
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:01,906
It's a stupid question.

575
00:55:06,814 --> 00:55:10,331
- You want me to tell her?
- What? That I love her?

576
00:55:13,237 --> 00:55:16,837
No, you can tell her now, himself.

577
00:55:19,118 --> 00:55:21,425
See you two together...

578
00:55:24,123 --> 00:55:26,430
makes me happy, Stanton.

579
00:55:51,108 --> 00:55:53,415
You shouldn't have, Giacomo.

580
00:55:53,444 --> 00:55:56,252
Looks like we got
a go on away party.

581
00:55:56,531 --> 00:55:58,644
- SAS, right?
- That's right, mate.

582
00:55:58,744 --> 00:56:00,098
What can I do you for?

583
00:56:00,198 --> 00:56:03,995
There is absolutely nothing
that you guys can do for us,

584
00:56:03,996 --> 00:56:07,123
but we dragged the fat
fish and ship eating asses out

585
00:56:07,124 --> 00:56:09,167
- of a world war.
- Two of them.

586
00:56:09,168 --> 00:56:12,504
Two. Two world wars.

587
00:56:12,505 --> 00:56:16,313
And you ladies can not run a
simple extract op out of Bosnia.

588
00:56:17,009 --> 00:56:20,651
- You're drunk, mate.
- No... Not drunk enough.

589
00:56:56,132 --> 00:56:58,439
How you doing, Porter?

590
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,569
- Clear left.
- Clear right.

591
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:06,489
Pays to be a winner.

592
00:57:07,393 --> 00:57:10,645
My dad, he was a
career naval officer.

593
00:57:10,646 --> 00:57:12,564
So is my grand dad.

594
00:57:12,565 --> 00:57:16,290
They both fought in a war.
Who do we fighting in?

595
00:57:17,987 --> 00:57:21,128
A stupid peacekeeping mission.

596
00:57:27,205 --> 00:57:29,428
You lost.

597
00:57:33,711 --> 00:57:36,644
- What?
- What you been doing?

598
00:57:36,714 --> 00:57:38,813
You been fighting?

599
00:57:38,975 --> 00:57:40,073
No!

600
00:57:40,173 --> 00:57:43,275
So you didn't run
into any of the SAS?

601
00:57:43,721 --> 00:57:48,141
It's funny. Those things in your
faces seem like you did.

602
00:57:48,142 --> 00:57:50,116
Yeah...

603
00:57:51,479 --> 00:57:53,605
- Cheers to that.
- We'll make you proud chief.

604
00:57:53,606 --> 00:57:56,358
- Oh you do.
- Cheers... To your next battle.

605
00:57:56,359 --> 00:57:58,165
Yes sir.

606
00:58:02,490 --> 00:58:04,866
What? You couldn't
do it. You lost.

607
00:58:04,867 --> 00:58:07,619
- Rack him up again?
- What?

608
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:09,913
- I got something.
- Oh yeah, a full glass.

609
00:58:09,914 --> 00:58:12,555
No, no, listen.
Follow me, follow me.

610
00:58:14,335 --> 00:58:16,294
- What do you got?
- So.

611
00:58:16,295 --> 00:58:18,922
Reason it's gonna take us a week
to get into that vault is

612
00:58:18,923 --> 00:58:20,966
- we can only do an one hour dive, right?
- Yeah.

613
00:58:20,967 --> 00:58:22,844
But if we build a operation base somewhere

614
00:58:23,044 --> 00:58:25,011
down there,
an air pocket we can work out...

615
00:58:25,012 --> 00:58:28,598
We can work non stop and
decompressing right at the end.

616
00:58:28,599 --> 00:58:32,158
Yeah, a airtight area
we can pump air into.

617
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:40,207
Smart man,
get Stanton on the phone.

618
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:42,654
Yeah, altar is on the main level.

619
00:58:42,655 --> 00:58:45,782
Above that's the choir gallery.
The steeple made out of stone.

620
00:58:45,783 --> 00:58:49,300
- Is there a bell inside the steeple?
<i>- Solid bronze.</i>

621
00:58:49,495 --> 00:58:51,580
Well then, we start by
pumping air out of the bell.

622
00:58:51,581 --> 00:58:54,249
<i>And then we'll load in the generator
and we pump up the choir floor.</i>

623
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:56,251
That will be our operation's base.

624
00:58:56,252 --> 00:58:59,921
- How long do you think this op will take?
- Eight hours tops.

625
00:58:59,922 --> 00:59:02,646
We could be back before sun rise.

626
00:59:02,967 --> 00:59:05,649
Get the gear down to the dock
as fast as you can.

627
00:59:11,642 --> 00:59:14,241
The operation we talked about...

628
00:59:14,312 --> 00:59:16,619
We're going tonight.

629
00:59:17,273 --> 00:59:19,316
What!

630
00:59:19,317 --> 00:59:23,250
What did I tell you all?
In three days notice.

631
00:59:23,988 --> 00:59:26,239
Can't requisition a
helicopter just like that.

632
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,575
Alright.
What about pickup?

633
00:59:28,576 --> 00:59:31,133
Sun up.
Can you do it?

634
00:59:32,788 --> 00:59:36,514
- Same coordinates?
- 0-44-9 on the bun.

635
00:59:38,294 --> 00:59:42,436
You might wanna lay off that shit
a few hours in advance.

636
00:59:44,509 --> 00:59:47,594
Hey, do you know where we can find
another aircraft flying around?

637
00:59:47,595 --> 00:59:49,735
Pilot included?

638
00:59:58,064 --> 01:00:01,149
Hey Porter! Give me something good man.
We need bird.

639
01:00:01,150 --> 01:00:04,236
There is a C-160 in the north hangar.
It's just got back from the refueling run.

640
01:00:04,237 --> 01:00:07,030
- Subtle.
- Yeah, that's my middle name.

641
01:00:07,031 --> 01:00:09,171
Alright, Ben, take it down.

642
01:00:14,705 --> 01:00:17,374
- Let's go! Orders just come in.
- What orders?

643
01:00:17,375 --> 01:00:19,055
We didn't get any authorization for any...

644
01:00:19,106 --> 01:00:21,002
Emergency operation in
under five minutes to go.

645
01:00:21,003 --> 01:00:23,380
- Thought SAS would seal transport
- Yeah, they were.

646
01:00:23,381 --> 01:00:26,424
But command decided we needed
real men flying us on this mission.

647
01:00:26,425 --> 01:00:29,136
That's you guys.
So, load her up.

648
01:00:29,137 --> 01:00:31,444
Load her up, boys.

649
01:01:00,877 --> 01:01:02,808
Two minutes!

650
01:02:59,829 --> 01:03:04,013
Hey chief, I think this crazy
idea might just work.

651
01:03:14,510 --> 01:03:17,318
Nice plan...
Nice plan.

652
01:04:40,179 --> 01:04:44,029
- You okay?
- Yeah, no problems.

653
01:05:27,643 --> 01:05:29,784
Good.

654
01:05:43,951 --> 01:05:45,883
<i>Is that her?</i>

655
01:05:47,955 --> 01:05:49,929
<i>She won't get far.</i>

656
01:05:52,668 --> 01:05:54,809
<i>Stay with him.</i>

657
01:06:49,892 --> 01:06:52,032
Two, three!

658
01:06:57,775 --> 01:06:59,901
Here you go.

659
01:06:59,902 --> 01:07:01,862
All right, boys.

660
01:07:01,863 --> 01:07:04,823
Time to drill through a stone wall.
Say your prayers.

661
01:07:04,824 --> 01:07:08,090
We break the wall,
break the vault...

662
01:07:08,286 --> 01:07:10,217
Gold deluxe.

663
01:08:30,868 --> 01:08:32,994
Mortar around the stone
is starting to oxidize.

664
01:08:32,995 --> 01:08:35,872
- From the air we're pumping in.
- How long it is gonna hold?

665
01:08:35,873 --> 01:08:39,390
Not long. This place has not
seen oxygen for 50 years.

666
01:08:46,592 --> 01:08:47,968
- Sir?
- Yeah?

667
01:08:47,969 --> 01:08:50,095
I saw Porter with Rainey
and Detroit the other day.

668
01:08:50,096 --> 01:08:52,222
Very animated conversation.

669
01:08:52,223 --> 01:08:54,554
Get Rainey and Detroit
into my office ASAP.

670
01:08:54,723 --> 01:08:55,723
Yes, sir!

671
01:09:14,203 --> 01:09:17,052
- Time check, boys?
- We are four hours.

672
01:09:17,206 --> 01:09:20,389
- How much air we got left?
- Two hours at the most.

673
01:09:23,129 --> 01:09:25,130
- Get back!
- Go, go, go, go!

674
01:09:25,131 --> 01:09:26,798
Move it!

675
01:09:26,799 --> 01:09:28,898
Go! Get down!

676
01:09:30,094 --> 01:09:31,984
Where's the crowbar?

677
01:09:36,392 --> 01:09:39,325
Give me that.
It's gonna jam up here.

678
01:09:59,791 --> 01:10:02,723
Well, you two, were seen
with them recently.

679
01:10:02,877 --> 01:10:04,878
And I wanna know,
what they are up to.

680
01:10:04,879 --> 01:10:09,466
Sir... We are super friendly individuals.
We talk to just about anybody.

681
01:10:09,467 --> 01:10:11,885
It is harder to remember
one from another.

682
01:10:11,886 --> 01:10:15,945
Lieutenant, if you withhold
information from me,

683
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:20,560
I will see to it that this man straps
his ass into a cockpit ever again.

684
01:10:20,561 --> 01:10:23,230
Sir, with all due respect...

685
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:24,773
Stop right there, Lieutenant.

686
01:10:24,774 --> 01:10:28,693
In my experience, when a man rephrase a
statement with the phrase with all respect,

687
01:10:28,694 --> 01:10:31,780
he is about to say something
disrespectful and quite possibly stupid.

688
01:10:31,781 --> 01:10:34,880
Are you certain you wish to continue.

689
01:10:35,952 --> 01:10:38,954
- Sir, yes.
- Be my guest.

690
01:10:38,955 --> 01:10:44,042
This man received 14 medals for
heroic and meritorious acts.

691
01:10:44,043 --> 01:10:46,503
Once flew an FA-18 in battle
one of his engines blown off,

692
01:10:46,504 --> 01:10:48,421
he refueled mid-flight,

693
01:10:48,422 --> 01:10:50,340
because he knew if he returned to the
base, he would be grounded.

694
01:10:50,341 --> 01:10:55,484
The point is Detroit Turner
is the best pilot the Navy has.

695
01:10:56,806 --> 01:10:58,807
Well I believe you might
be right, Lieutenant.

696
01:10:58,808 --> 01:11:01,115
I need you.

697
01:11:04,564 --> 01:11:07,121
I do not need you, however.

698
01:11:07,567 --> 01:11:10,152
- Petty officer Clearwater?
- Sir?

699
01:11:10,153 --> 01:11:13,043
Prepare discharge papers
for Lieutenant Rainey.

700
01:11:13,156 --> 01:11:15,045
Yes, sir!

701
01:11:21,873 --> 01:11:25,514
You are suddenly uncharacteristic
quite Lieutenant.

702
01:11:26,002 --> 01:11:29,143
You sure there is not something
you'd like to share with me?

703
01:11:48,608 --> 01:11:50,539
<i>Keep going.</i>

704
01:11:53,529 --> 01:11:57,546
So, me and Porter are gonna go down first.
Alright? Then you two.

705
01:12:01,537 --> 01:12:03,511
Understand?

706
01:12:07,418 --> 01:12:11,936
- You are friends for a long time?
- Can't remember the time we weren't.

707
01:12:12,256 --> 01:12:14,216
I see sadness in him.

708
01:12:14,217 --> 01:12:18,567
- Yeah, well, we all got our troubles, Lara.
- His is at home.

709
01:12:20,389 --> 01:12:22,613
His wife.

710
01:12:23,184 --> 01:12:26,228
He does not talk about it anymore.
Not even to me.

711
01:12:26,229 --> 01:12:28,327
What happened?

712
01:12:31,484 --> 01:12:34,250
Two years ago his wife
got into a car accident.

713
01:12:34,278 --> 01:12:36,418
She survived.

714
01:12:36,572 --> 01:12:39,338
Their little girl, Billie...

715
01:12:40,493 --> 01:12:42,800
She didn't.

716
01:12:43,037 --> 01:12:45,136
She was three.

717
01:12:45,414 --> 01:12:48,917
Went home to bury her. And after
that nothing was same between them.

718
01:12:48,918 --> 01:12:50,850
Matt just...

719
01:12:52,004 --> 01:12:54,520
Matt just can't forgive her.

720
01:14:32,104 --> 01:14:35,621
So, now she done nothing to say, huh?

721
01:14:36,192 --> 01:14:37,235
JP!

722
01:14:37,435 --> 01:14:39,110
And what about you,
lover boy? No comment?

723
01:14:39,111 --> 01:14:41,112
JP, enough!

724
01:14:41,113 --> 01:14:43,365
What? It was a waste of time.
There's nothing down there.

725
01:14:43,366 --> 01:14:45,534
- I don't understand.
- Let me explain to you.

726
01:14:45,535 --> 01:14:49,343
- There was no gold!
- Alright, cut it out, boys.

727
01:14:49,622 --> 01:14:52,430
- Lara, it's not your fault.
- What?

728
01:14:52,542 --> 01:14:55,460
- It is her fault.
- JP, It's not her fault.

729
01:14:55,461 --> 01:14:57,546
It was a story told to a kid.

730
01:14:57,547 --> 01:14:59,631
To any kid that would
look like a lot of gold.

731
01:14:59,632 --> 01:15:02,050
Village must have flooded
before they got it out of the trucks.

732
01:15:02,051 --> 01:15:04,136
The gold must be scattered
all over the valley.

733
01:15:04,137 --> 01:15:05,462
It's another story, Stanton?

734
01:15:05,523 --> 01:15:09,321
At least we got ourselves
10 bars of Gold!

735
01:15:09,475 --> 01:15:12,992
Alright? That is a hell
of a lot money for me.

736
01:15:13,312 --> 01:15:15,619
And for us.

737
01:15:15,731 --> 01:15:18,692
- And for you.
- Good point Duffy.

738
01:15:18,693 --> 01:15:23,002
- Great, great. I'm getting out of it.
- You're getting us all out of here.

739
01:15:23,072 --> 01:15:26,755
Super C-8, this is F-150.
What is your status?

740
01:15:27,743 --> 01:15:31,510
<i>We're about lift off, brother.
See you all soon.</i>

741
01:16:11,829 --> 01:16:15,040
- What's going on, chief?
- The wall down there with Latin words...

742
01:16:15,041 --> 01:16:17,765
It's wrong.
The stone is upside down.

743
01:16:18,419 --> 01:16:20,226
Grab that.

744
01:16:20,671 --> 01:16:23,229
Let's smash away through that wall
and see what's behind.

745
01:19:21,978 --> 01:19:23,826
<i>Gear up!</i>

746
01:21:05,206 --> 01:21:07,179
<i>Throw the explosives.</i>

747
01:21:09,919 --> 01:21:11,795
- Everybody all right?
- You are okay?

748
01:21:11,796 --> 01:21:14,881
- No way to tell, how many are up there.
- Does not matter.

749
01:21:14,882 --> 01:21:18,441
- Let's finish the job we're doing, alright?
- All right, let's move.

750
01:22:33,669 --> 01:22:35,810
<i>Lower, lower!</i>

751
01:24:23,988 --> 01:24:26,698
So, remind me again,
who did the math?

752
01:24:26,699 --> 01:24:28,617
And how much air do
we need down here huh?

753
01:24:28,618 --> 01:24:31,328
- Oh yeah, the Math genius.
- I'm sorry, I didn't count enough.

754
01:24:31,329 --> 01:24:33,246
With some crazy Serbs
shoving grenades at us, OK?

755
01:24:33,247 --> 01:24:35,749
It's called a contingency plan.

756
01:24:35,750 --> 01:24:38,794
Prepare for the worst. There are boy
scouts who know this, for crying out loud.

757
01:24:38,795 --> 01:24:40,921
You're breathing air, right?
That's because of this Math genius.

758
01:24:40,922 --> 01:24:43,006
So, why don't you just shut your mouth
and stop hogging my half of the air?

759
01:24:43,007 --> 01:24:44,485
I'm gonna buy you a
calculator for your next

760
01:24:44,509 --> 01:24:47,233
birthday, you know that, Ben?
A nice big calc...

761
01:24:47,512 --> 01:24:49,221
- Hey, Lara.
- Hey.

762
01:24:49,222 --> 01:24:50,931
- You alright?
- Yeah.

763
01:24:50,932 --> 01:24:52,432
Okay.

764
01:24:52,433 --> 01:24:53,892
- And you too, Ben? You alright?
- I'm fine.

765
01:24:53,893 --> 01:24:56,450
- Good.
- I'm fine.

766
01:24:57,313 --> 01:25:00,065
We'll need little more air to
get to the surface.

767
01:25:00,066 --> 01:25:02,818
- There is a couple of tanks in the trash.
- Great.

768
01:25:02,819 --> 01:25:05,570
- I'll go with you.
- No, stay here.

769
01:25:05,571 --> 01:25:08,254
Alright? Stay here.

770
01:25:10,660 --> 01:25:12,953
- Hey dude?
- Yes?

771
01:25:12,954 --> 01:25:14,357
We need way more air.

772
01:25:14,857 --> 01:25:17,763
Hey, Porter,
do not even start with that OK?

773
01:27:14,450 --> 01:27:16,034
- Nice!
- You ready?

774
01:27:16,035 --> 01:27:18,703
Alright, we got enemies on the surface
and no primary...

775
01:27:18,704 --> 01:27:21,540
- So what? We use the secondary.
- All right.

776
01:27:21,541 --> 01:27:23,472
Here we go.

777
01:27:39,225 --> 01:27:42,450
Watch for signs of
decompression sickness.

778
01:27:42,937 --> 01:27:45,202
We're good, we're good
We got this.

779
01:27:57,952 --> 01:28:00,092
<i>Straight ahead!</i>

780
01:28:09,755 --> 01:28:11,479
Shit!

781
01:28:11,632 --> 01:28:13,773
<i>Give it to me.</i>

782
01:28:26,147 --> 01:28:28,078
Shit!

783
01:28:29,609 --> 01:28:32,374
<i>I always said I
will go out with a bang.</i>

784
01:28:41,913 --> 01:28:45,429
Time to feed the
fishes, assholes.

785
01:28:49,212 --> 01:28:51,227
Nice shot!

786
01:28:55,176 --> 01:28:56,816
Yeah!

787
01:29:30,128 --> 01:29:32,268
Heads up!

788
01:30:05,788 --> 01:30:08,265
You degenerates do realize,
as you would be dead

789
01:30:08,465 --> 01:30:10,625
if I had not sent Detroit to the rescue.

790
01:30:10,626 --> 01:30:12,461
- Thank you sir.
- I am not interested in a "Thank you".

791
01:30:12,462 --> 01:30:15,255
But I want you to present
a goddamn explanation.

792
01:30:15,256 --> 01:30:16,965
And I tell you what you
can start with this...

793
01:30:16,966 --> 01:30:19,384
Since when the US Navy SEALs

794
01:30:19,385 --> 01:30:22,526
bring a civilian female
along on a mission?

795
01:30:22,889 --> 01:30:26,989
Shut up! Finish the decomp
and get your butts up to my office!

796
01:30:27,018 --> 01:30:28,435
Yes, sir.

797
01:30:28,436 --> 01:30:31,480
Is that what goes on around this
base on a day to day basis?

798
01:30:31,481 --> 01:30:35,066
Taking civilian female
out for a little troll?

799
01:30:35,067 --> 01:30:38,292
Little spin in our humvee
and in our chopper?

800
01:30:38,571 --> 01:30:41,281
Jesus Christ! This Navy is
not what it used to be!

801
01:30:41,282 --> 01:30:43,798
Not by a goddamn country mile.

802
01:30:44,035 --> 01:30:45,475
So you thought, you could just steal

803
01:30:45,550 --> 01:30:48,552
all that gold and get away with it?
On my watch?

804
01:30:48,623 --> 01:30:52,626
No, sir. We were gonna
give you a full report, sir.

805
01:30:52,627 --> 01:30:54,934
- Were you now?
- Yes, sir.

806
01:30:55,087 --> 01:30:57,380
As soon as the gold was secured.

807
01:30:57,381 --> 01:31:00,467
- Do I look like a moron to you, Barnes?
- Yes... No, sir.

808
01:31:00,468 --> 01:31:02,775
No, I'm sorry sir.

809
01:31:02,929 --> 01:31:04,433
Let me ask you simple to this.

810
01:31:04,533 --> 01:31:07,140
What did you plan to do
with 27 tons of gold bars?

811
01:31:07,141 --> 01:31:10,685
- Put it in your socks?
- Sir, turn over it to the people of Bosnia.

812
01:31:10,686 --> 01:31:13,063
As a way helping rebuild
their country. Sir.

813
01:31:13,064 --> 01:31:16,997
OK, hold on.
Just... Just a second.

814
01:31:17,235 --> 01:31:19,416
I might cry.

815
01:31:22,990 --> 01:31:25,047
No, I don't think I will.

816
01:31:25,785 --> 01:31:28,370
You realize you broke damn
near every oath you took

817
01:31:28,371 --> 01:31:31,720
when you decided to embark
on this little escapade?

818
01:31:31,791 --> 01:31:33,973
Yes, sir.

819
01:31:34,418 --> 01:31:39,381
Now, I suppose I can spin
this in a positive light,

820
01:31:39,382 --> 01:31:43,301
emphasize that the operation
lead us Petrovic,

821
01:31:43,302 --> 01:31:46,777
one of the biggest
stones in NATO's side.

822
01:31:48,474 --> 01:31:51,518
How much are we talking about
here? I mean in US dollars?

823
01:31:51,519 --> 01:31:53,270
Sir as of yesterday's exchange rate

824
01:31:53,271 --> 01:31:56,954
24 tons of gold bars will be
302 million dollars.

825
01:31:59,068 --> 01:32:02,501
302 million dollars.

826
01:32:03,197 --> 01:32:05,463
That's a lot of money, isn't it?

827
01:32:06,284 --> 01:32:09,870
<i>In the midst all the chaos
we are facing in this conflict,</i>

828
01:32:09,871 --> 01:32:12,998
this operation clearly
demonstrated what can be accomplished

829
01:32:12,999 --> 01:32:17,725
through the carefully planned and
executed efforts of the US military.

830
01:32:17,962 --> 01:32:22,674
Thanks to the heroic and
selfless acts of this team of US NAVY SEALs

831
01:32:22,675 --> 01:32:24,468
and their local contacts,

832
01:32:24,469 --> 01:32:27,401
I can now announce that this gold,

833
01:32:27,472 --> 01:32:31,280
stolen by the Nazi
regime 50 years ago,

834
01:32:31,517 --> 01:32:36,035
and valued at 150
million US dollars,

835
01:32:36,355 --> 01:32:39,830
will soon be returned to
its rightful place in France.

836
01:32:40,234 --> 01:32:42,694
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
the Prime Minister of France

837
01:32:42,695 --> 01:32:47,004
will present Lara Simic
with the <i>Legion d'Honneur</i>.

838
01:33:03,132 --> 01:33:05,815
Well this is your lucky day, ladies.

839
01:33:06,385 --> 01:33:08,845
And actual lady.

840
01:33:08,846 --> 01:33:12,182
- Do you know why it's your lucky day?
- No, sir.

841
01:33:12,183 --> 01:33:14,518
Because my despicable brother-in-law,

842
01:33:14,519 --> 01:33:18,396
who also happens to be my
financial adviser and broker,

843
01:33:18,397 --> 01:33:21,274
was able to unload
those gold bars

844
01:33:21,275 --> 01:33:24,667
that somehow did not find
their way back to France.

845
01:33:26,572 --> 01:33:28,879
I'll now distribute...

846
01:33:29,492 --> 01:33:32,800
your shares of this
momentous heist.

847
01:33:33,663 --> 01:33:36,178
- Moran.
- Thank you, sir.

848
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:40,182
- Duffy.
- Thank you very much, sir.

849
01:33:41,879 --> 01:33:44,478
- Porter.
- Thank you, sir.

850
01:33:45,883 --> 01:33:48,983
- Barnes.
- Thank you, sir.

851
01:33:51,347 --> 01:33:53,487
Baker.

852
01:33:53,891 --> 01:33:56,240
Ms. Simic.

853
01:33:57,937 --> 01:34:00,897
Sorry, but don't these
make your lucky day?

854
01:34:00,898 --> 01:34:02,816
So, we do all the work,
he gets the spoils.

855
01:34:02,817 --> 01:34:06,167
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Do I look like I'm kidding?

856
01:34:06,446 --> 01:34:08,919
Have I ever looked
like I was kidding?

857
01:34:09,198 --> 01:34:11,839
You're lucky you get that,
not a court Marshall.

858
01:34:13,578 --> 01:34:15,801
Thank you.

859
01:34:15,955 --> 01:34:18,095
You're welcome.

860
01:34:30,553 --> 01:34:34,862
Well, that's what you
philanthropists wanted, isn't that right?

861
01:34:35,141 --> 01:34:37,392
- Yes, sir.
- Excellent.

862
01:34:37,393 --> 01:34:40,868
Then we should all be happy
as clams at high tide.

863
01:34:41,355 --> 01:34:44,205
- Dismissed.
- Thank you, sir.

864
01:34:45,109 --> 01:34:47,249
This...

865
01:34:48,863 --> 01:34:51,212
This belongs to you too.

866
01:34:55,787 --> 01:34:57,718
Lara?

867
01:34:59,665 --> 01:35:01,972
This also belongs to you.

868
01:35:15,389 --> 01:35:17,808
If I could just get like a flat
or something with my name on it,

869
01:35:17,809 --> 01:35:19,893
or like a bronze bust,

870
01:35:19,894 --> 01:35:23,271
even a bowling alley or something,
it would be great, thanks.

871
01:35:23,272 --> 01:35:25,621
There you go. It's yours.

872
01:35:37,703 --> 01:35:39,885
We did it.

873
01:35:42,125 --> 01:35:46,475
You are okay there, sir?
Your eyes seem to be watering.

874
01:35:46,754 --> 01:35:48,894
Dismissed!

875
01:35:58,391 --> 01:36:01,240
Come on, cowboys.
I am buying.

876
01:36:01,561 --> 01:36:03,659
- Oh yes.
- Yes ma'am!

877
01:36:05,731 --> 01:36:08,873
Alright, enough,
Off to the bar.

878
