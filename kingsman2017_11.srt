1
0:0:0.619 --> 0:0:2.786
as all surviving agents
are present,

2
0:0:2.821 --> 0:0:5.189
we follow the doomsday protocol.

3
0:0:5.223 --> 0:0:8.427
When that's done,
and only then...

4
0:0:10.695 --> 0:0:12.831
you may shed a tear in private.

5
0:0:12.863 --> 0:0:15.033
(SIGHS)
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

6
0:0:15.632 --> 0:0:17.602
Okay.

7
0:0:17.634 --> 0:0:19.170
What's the doomsday protocol?

8
0:0:20.639 --> 0:0:22.241
We go shopping.

9
0:0:36.455 --> 0:0:39.957
We're from Kingsman.
We'd like to buy some wine.

10
0:0:39.990 --> 0:0:42.994
And use tasting room
number three, please.

11
0:0:46.630 --> 0:0:48.100
Not one of my predecessors

12
0:0:48.132 --> 0:0:50.334
has ever been
in this situation before.

13
0:0:52.536 --> 0:0:53.938
Thank God.

14
0:0:57.141 --> 0:0:58.142
A-ha.

15
0:1:1.679 --> 0:1:2.913
Remember this?

16
0:1:2.948 --> 0:1:4.216
EGGSY: Yeah,
how could I forget?

17
0:1:13.490 --> 0:1:16.560
Whatever's in that safe
is the answer to all our problems.

18
0:1:24.268 --> 0:1:25.370
Huh.

19
0:1:32.810 --> 0:1:34.012
Is that it?

20
0:1:34.044 --> 0:1:36.247
I suppose that must be
upper-class humor.

21
0:1:37.948 --> 0:1:39.217
I don't get it.

22
0:1:39.249 --> 0:1:41.185
Me neither. What the fuck
are we supposed to do now?

23
0:1:42.954 --> 0:1:44.156
I think we should drink a toast

24
0:1:44.188 --> 0:1:46.024
to our fallen comrades.

25
0:1:50.660 --> 0:1:51.763
To Roxy.

26
0:1:51.795 --> 0:1:53.030
Roxy.

27
0:1:56.935 --> 0:1:58.169
Ooh.

28
0:2:1.206 --> 0:2:3.275
To Arthur.
Arthur.

29
0:2:6.811 --> 0:2:8.179
Mmm.

30
0:2:8.211 --> 0:2:9.546
Should we do one for JB?

31
0:2:9.580 --> 0:2:10.749
I think we should.

32
0:2:17.088 --> 0:2:19.091
(MERLIN SOBBING)

33
0:2:24.361 --> 0:2:26.430
I should have seen it coming.

34
0:2:27.098 --> 0:2:28.832
Charlie, the taxi.

35
0:2:28.865 --> 0:2:30.200
It's all my fault.

36
0:2:30.234 --> 0:2:34.039
No, that's bullshit, Merlin.
It ain't all your fault.

37
0:2:34.872 --> 0:2:36.540
You're the best, bruv.

38
0:2:36.573 --> 0:2:38.476
Honestly, without you...

39
0:2:38.509 --> 0:2:40.711
I'd have lost it
a long time ago.

40
0:2:40.745 --> 0:2:42.179
(MERLIN MUMBLES)

41
0:2:43.447 --> 0:2:45.149
I think we should
drink to Scotland.

42
0:2:45.182 --> 0:2:48.085
I think we've probably
had enough, to be honest.

43
0:2:49.019 --> 0:2:50.388
You're probably right.

44
0:2:57.929 --> 0:3:0.264
Merlin.
Aye?
