Breaking news

2
00:01:30,792 --> 00:01:33,582
a robbery took place at
the Louvre museum today

3
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:36,332
one high value artefact has been stolen

4
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:38,457
police say a suspect led police
on a high speed chase

5
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:41,749
for approximately 18 km
before the man was caught

6
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:45,749
a museum official states that the stolen
artefact known as the "eye of the forest"

7
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,374
which, together with the "wings of
destiny" and the "rope of life"

8
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:52,457
forms a three-piece precious necklace
known as "Gaia"

9
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:56,832
this 17th century necklace was made
as a gift from Spain to the Chinese emperor

10
00:01:56,833 --> 00:02:00,041
it was later divided up
and smuggled out of the country

11
00:02:54,917 --> 00:02:57,750
looks like you managed to keep in shape

12
00:02:58,708 --> 00:02:59,708
thank you!

13
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:01,041
Need a ride?

14
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:02,041
I'll walk

15
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:02,958
of course

16
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:05,125
after five years in the pen

17
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,499
I imagine you needed some fresh air

18
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,375
it's good to be free

19
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:15,167
just because you're out of prison
doesn't mean you're really free

20
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,333
yeah!

21
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:21,208
I could say the same to you

22
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,041
tail him

23
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,708
impressive work

24
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:42,333
didn't even bother with the alarm

25
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:45,999
probably just tapped right
into the wireless system

26
00:04:46,042 --> 00:04:50,292
and disabled the security cameras remotely

27
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,166
any fingerprints?

28
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:54,708
No, sir

29
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,666
very impressive indeed

30
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:04,125
must be how you earned this

31
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,916
I'm hoping we can help each other

32
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,750
where is he headed?

33
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,208
Screw you, cop

34
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,083
you know I didn't do this

35
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,125
you got no evidence on me

36
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:24,125
thank you

37
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:27,125
now I have your fingerprints
at the crime scene

38
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:29,416
pretty damning evidence for a jury

39
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,125
where is he?

40
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:35,333
Comm check

41
00:06:35,334 --> 00:06:36,958
crystal clear, comm secure

42
00:07:15,292 --> 00:07:16,292
head to the lighthouse

43
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:17,916
you'll find everything you need there

44
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,500
"watch list"

45
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,749
want me to Photoshop your picture?

46
00:07:57,167 --> 00:07:59,167
Make sure it looks natural

47
00:08:01,292 --> 00:08:03,750
congratulations!
You just turned over a new leaf

48
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:18,583
stop animal cruelty!

49
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,125
Stop animal cruelty!

50
00:08:41,292 --> 00:08:42,625
I'm in

51
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,083
I'm almost in position

52
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,416
how's our new partner doing?

53
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,624
She should be here any minute

54
00:09:12,792 --> 00:09:14,042
drinks on me!

55
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:22,083
Hello there. Anybody home?

56
00:09:23,167 --> 00:09:24,333
Good morning

57
00:09:26,417 --> 00:09:27,875
welcome

58
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:29,583
allow me to introduce you

59
00:09:29,792 --> 00:09:31,291
the most beautiful thief of the year

60
00:09:31,292 --> 00:09:32,542
red ye

61
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,874
I barely know you

62
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,475
and you're addressing me by my full name

63
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,166
since we still have some time

64
00:09:39,167 --> 00:09:40,500
why don't we have a chat?

65
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:41,916
Do you have a boyfriend?

66
00:09:41,917 --> 00:09:43,917
Married?

67
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,416
Are we here for work

68
00:09:46,417 --> 00:09:48,083
or is this match-making?

69
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:51,958
I'm starting to have serious doubts
about this guy's work ethic

70
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,916
oh, please

71
00:09:53,917 --> 00:09:55,167
you don't even know me

72
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,041
Po Chen

73
00:09:58,292 --> 00:10:01,624
born 1989 at yuan general hospital
in Kaohsiung, Taiwan

74
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,124
your father worked at a newsstand

75
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,541
he died when you were 12 years old

76
00:10:05,042 --> 00:10:06,332
you dropped out of school at 16

77
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:07,874
wandered the streets
until you met Dan Zhang

78
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,374
and you became his protégé

79
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:12,791
rumor has it, you're a virgin who's a Virgo

80
00:10:13,417 --> 00:10:15,750
judging from the way
you just tried to hit on me

81
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:17,708
that's no surprise at all

82
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,583
you think I wouldn't do my homework
before joining a new crew?

83
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,832
Well, if you had done your homework

84
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,541
you'd also know that
I'm the best hacker in the game

85
00:10:30,542 --> 00:10:31,542
okay?

86
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:35,124
Only insecure people need to brag

87
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,332
actions speak louder than words

88
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,333
got it?

89
00:10:39,417 --> 00:10:40,375
I'm impressed

90
00:10:40,376 --> 00:10:42,500
pretty thorough investigation

91
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:45,624

92
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:46,625

Alright, stand by

Last chance

99
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,416
going once...

100
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:10,458
Going twice...

101
00:11:11,417 --> 00:11:13,917
Sold for Eur 200,000

102
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,791

00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,999

00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,124

the "wings of destiny"

107
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:37,958
thank you

108
00:11:38,292 --> 00:11:40,917
I hope by auctioning this treasure of mine

109
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,416
to help build
the largest wildlife zoo in Europe

110
00:11:44,542 --> 00:11:48,542
many endangered animals
can be lifted out of misery

111
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:55,249
"target locked"

112
00:12:01,792 --> 00:12:03,250

we know him well, he's a French cop

117
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,291
he specializes in international theft

118
00:12:26,917 --> 00:12:27,917

00:12:27,917 --> 00:12:28,917

122
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:36,541
do you guys have a plan B?

123
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:39,166
Zhang

124
00:12:39,167 --> 00:12:40,500

ls that the suspect
you're talking about, inspector?

135
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:31,124
Should we have him escorted out?

136
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,750
Not yet

137
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,083

fur is for beautiful animals

140
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,999
not ugly people!

141
00:13:51,792 --> 00:13:54,958
Tingting loves to wear fur!

142
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:10,125
Stop animal cruelty!

143
00:14:10,542 --> 00:14:12,708
Storm the auction house!

144
00:14:16,292 --> 00:14:18,083
What are you up to?

145
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,874
Transport the auction
pieces back to the vault

146
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:32,166
bring the guests to the VIP room

147
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,458
Po, the "wings of destiny" is on you

148
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:44,166
stop killing animals!

149
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,749
There's a robbery in progress

150
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,000
open up

151
00:15:29,917 --> 00:15:30,917
inspector

152
00:15:30,918 --> 00:15:33,457
we've been here the whole time.
No one has attempted to...

153
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,249
Call your captain

154
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:52,875
found it

155
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:02,308
how much longer do we have to wait here?

156
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,000
Red, your location

157
00:16:07,417 --> 00:16:10,125
I'm on the way, are you still inside?

158
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:11,874
I'm still there

159
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:35,874
- Yes
- open the vault

160
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:38,416
someone is stealing the "wings of destiny"

161
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:39,583
that's impossible

162
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,499
listen to me

163
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,416
this whole protest is a ruse

164
00:16:43,417 --> 00:16:44,457
open it!

165
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:47,541
Perhaps if you'd be kind enough
to share some of your information

166
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,291
you're wasting time

167
00:16:50,292 --> 00:16:52,083
open the vault!

168
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,041
I want everyone on high alert

169
00:17:06,042 --> 00:17:07,208
go!

170
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:18,333
Open the vault

171
00:18:00,542 --> 00:18:02,083
come on

172
00:18:14,542 --> 00:18:15,917
oh my god

173
00:18:18,167 --> 00:18:20,249
lock down all exits to the hotel

174
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,708
parking lots, everything!

175
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,208
I have the package, let's regroup

176
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,291
be patient

177
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:28,000
since Pierre is here

178
00:18:28,667 --> 00:18:30,417
let's up the ante

179
00:18:30,667 --> 00:18:31,958
your turn, demon

180
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:36,124
excuse me

181
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,916
- watch!
- Oh, sorry...

182
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:40,167
It's okay, guys

183
00:18:40,417 --> 00:18:41,457
thank you!

184
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:42,333
You're welcome

185
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:43,291
may I sit here?

186
00:18:43,292 --> 00:18:44,208
Sure

187
00:18:44,209 --> 00:18:45,874
it's alright

188
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,749
Cannes is full of fanatics

189
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,000
yes

190
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,041
as a matter of fact, I'm
a huge fan of yours

191
00:19:01,042 --> 00:19:02,166
really?

192
00:19:02,167 --> 00:19:03,374
Of course

193
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,333
I've seen all your movies

194
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:07,708
what is the name of the movie...

195
00:19:21,417 --> 00:19:22,417
Come on...

196
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:23,624
Stop that car!

197
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:24,750
Move!

198
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,833
Go...

199
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:33,958
Stop!

200
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:44,374
What?

201
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:45,750
Your necklace

202
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,500
stop!

203
00:20:32,042 --> 00:20:34,917
His driving is pretty damn good

204
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:47,791
out of my way

205
00:20:49,292 --> 00:20:50,500
move!

206
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:29,999
Think of something

207
00:22:08,292 --> 00:22:10,208
now I know what your plan B is

208
00:22:10,667 --> 00:22:11,917
that's good

209
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,874
now you can slow down

210
00:22:25,542 --> 00:22:28,375
all the security footage at the hotel
have been deleted

211
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:30,083
good job

212
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,124
you're still not retiring?

213
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:36,416
I still need "Gaia" to
find out who set me up

214
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:39,166
seems like you already
have an answer in mind

215
00:22:39,167 --> 00:22:42,125
beware "Gaia" may be a cursed artefact

216
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,375
still going back to Kong?

217
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:49,458
He's been waiting a long time for my return

218
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:06,125
Dan Zhang

219
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,550
what an honor to meet
the legendary Dan Zhang

220
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,041
you're so handsome

221
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:18,458
can I have your autograph?

222
00:23:19,167 --> 00:23:20,917
Do you want my autograph, or money?

223
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:22,333
Money

224
00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:25,708
I was told you play fair

225
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,791
I've been looking for a new partner

226
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:29,333
let me join you guys

227
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:31,541
she was pretty good this time

228
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:34,374
didn't Kong tell you
before he sent you here?

229
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:36,083
That was my last job

230
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,625
I'll find you if I come out of retirement

231
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,957
your welcome gift is like a rocket

232
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:43,041
you should give it a try

233
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:45,458
I'll try it for you

234
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:25,832
it is in this very tunnel,
the Cantaron's tunnel

235
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:28,207
a car crash between vehicles took place

236
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:30,707
stemming from a car chase

237
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:33,082
involving two alleged thieves

238
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:35,541
and a police officer, acting on his own

239
00:24:35,542 --> 00:24:38,124
as you can see behind me,
rescue team arrived on the scene

240
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:40,500
details are still unclear at this time

241
00:24:42,375 --> 00:24:45,875
damn it, Pierre.
This is your idea of "observing"?

242
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,250
Sit

243
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:50,541
you know why
I'm the one with this office right now

244
00:24:50,542 --> 00:24:51,667
and not you?

245
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:53,874
You're a better ass-kisser than me

246
00:24:54,042 --> 00:24:55,042
maybe

247
00:24:55,375 --> 00:24:57,457
but I'm not your partner anymore

248
00:24:57,458 --> 00:24:58,708
I'm your superior

249
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:01,791
from now on,
you'll share your Intel and collaborate

250
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:03,000
ls that clear?

251
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:06,791
What the hell are those?

252
00:25:08,417 --> 00:25:09,792
Chinese stress balls

253
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:12,250
helps me to relax

254
00:25:12,542 --> 00:25:14,375
you should give them a try

255
00:25:16,042 --> 00:25:17,333
I want to bring on help

256
00:25:17,792 --> 00:25:20,167
good, take anyone you want

257
00:25:20,875 --> 00:25:21,750
not a cop

258
00:25:21,751 --> 00:25:22,958
an expert

259
00:25:23,208 --> 00:25:25,749
someone who can lead me right to Zhang

260
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:28,207
who said anything about outside, I...

261
00:25:28,208 --> 00:25:29,791
You wanted me to collaborate

262
00:25:29,792 --> 00:25:31,125
with cops!

263
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:38,499
If you lose him again,
I won't be able to save your ass

264
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,791
understand?

265
00:25:49,708 --> 00:25:52,374
These cracks were not caused by hand

266
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,749
seems pretty straight forward to me

267
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:01,000
this painting is from the 19th century

268
00:26:01,125 --> 00:26:04,624
its canvas is coated with
a protective rabbit skin gesso

269
00:26:04,625 --> 00:26:07,082
which is highly sensitive to humidity

270
00:26:07,083 --> 00:26:09,541
as you can now see for yourself

271
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:11,750
ls it covered by our policy?

272
00:26:12,917 --> 00:26:14,499
I'm sorry. But...

273
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,624
Failure to maintain proper humidity
levels in the gallery

274
00:26:17,625 --> 00:26:19,541
ls considered human error

275
00:26:19,667 --> 00:26:22,041
I'm sorry, but it's not
covered by our policy

276
00:26:22,042 --> 00:26:24,000
if you'd like us to investigate further

277
00:26:24,542 --> 00:26:26,417
please let us know

278
00:26:30,542 --> 00:26:31,791
Amber Li?

279
00:26:31,792 --> 00:26:34,083
Inspector Pierre Bissette

280
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,916
what can I do for you?

281
00:26:36,917 --> 00:26:40,249
You have knowledge about a particular case

282
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:43,208
that I believe could be useful to me

283
00:26:43,625 --> 00:26:46,166
I was assigned to
the case of Tingting's necklace

284
00:26:46,167 --> 00:26:48,583
somehow I don't think that's
what you are here for

285
00:26:49,042 --> 00:26:50,667
do you know this man?

286
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:55,250
You already know the
answer to that question

287
00:26:55,583 --> 00:26:56,999
did he steal it?

288
00:26:57,708 --> 00:27:00,833
I think you already
know the answer to that question

289
00:27:02,667 --> 00:27:04,708
has he tried to contact you?

290
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:07,208
Am I a suspect?

291
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:09,041
No

292
00:27:09,042 --> 00:27:12,542
I haven't had any contact with him
since he went to jail

293
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:14,124
I didn't even know he got out

294
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,708
I know how it feels to be betrayed

295
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:22,833
nice try inspector.
Don't play mind games with me

296
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:25,166
you don't know the first thing about me

297
00:27:25,167 --> 00:27:27,416
I know that Zhang targeted you

298
00:27:27,417 --> 00:27:31,917
then used your inside information
to steal the "eye of the forest"

299
00:27:34,167 --> 00:27:36,000
so you want to use me as bait

300
00:27:36,292 --> 00:27:38,249
you know him better than anyone

301
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:39,083
with your help...

302
00:27:39,084 --> 00:27:41,291
I don't know him any better than I know you

303
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,708
good luck, inspector

304
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:50,124
call me, if you change your mind

305
00:27:51,042 --> 00:27:52,250
thank you

306
00:28:38,167 --> 00:28:40,042
how have you been?

307
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:44,041
I'm doing okay

308
00:29:19,042 --> 00:29:20,125
yes?

309
00:29:20,208 --> 00:29:22,166
I'll help you on one condition

310
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:23,583
when this is all over

311
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:26,583
you make sure Zhang gets locked up for good

312
00:29:26,875 --> 00:29:28,041
deal

313
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:29,707
now tell me

314
00:29:29,708 --> 00:29:31,541
where is the "rope of life"?

315
00:29:32,417 --> 00:29:33,917
Are you willing to travel?

316
00:30:26,167 --> 00:30:27,125
Good to see you back

317
00:30:27,126 --> 00:30:28,625
Kong is waiting for you

318
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,166
uncle Kong

319
00:30:53,708 --> 00:30:55,374
I've been waiting for you

320
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:04,916
I know

321
00:31:04,917 --> 00:31:06,666
I can always count on you

322
00:31:06,667 --> 00:31:07,667
well done

323
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:17,791
a new hobby you picked up?

324
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:19,417
Not a bad way to kill time

325
00:31:19,583 --> 00:31:21,916
you should consider it after you retire

326
00:31:24,667 --> 00:31:25,875
Taiwan boy

327
00:31:26,625 --> 00:31:27,750
you two are still working together?

328
00:31:28,042 --> 00:31:29,042
Uncle Kong

329
00:31:29,667 --> 00:31:30,958
good work

330
00:31:36,792 --> 00:31:38,583
before your incident

331
00:31:39,042 --> 00:31:41,499
I knew you wanted to retire

332
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,791
but I couldn't count on
anyone else to get this done

333
00:31:45,583 --> 00:31:47,124
this cheque

334
00:31:47,125 --> 00:31:49,166
I should've given it to you years ago

335
00:31:52,417 --> 00:31:53,833
don't worry. It's safe

336
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,541
it know it's less than you expect

337
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,500
I took some out

338
00:32:04,417 --> 00:32:05,917
for this

339
00:32:09,125 --> 00:32:10,166
after you got caught

340
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,624
I put the word out to track down the guy

341
00:32:12,625 --> 00:32:15,250
who stole the "eye of the forest" from you

342
00:32:18,292 --> 00:32:19,667
it took a while

343
00:32:20,708 --> 00:32:22,166
it was this bastard

344
00:32:27,417 --> 00:32:28,749
ls that a tongue?

345
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,083
Yes

346
00:32:33,042 --> 00:32:34,750
so the rumour is true. You did it

347
00:32:35,292 --> 00:32:37,332
there's a honor code amongst thieves

348
00:32:37,333 --> 00:32:38,874
I can't kill

349
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:40,625
but I can pay others to get it done

350
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:44,333
money well spent

351
00:32:45,875 --> 00:32:48,000
you're like a son to me

352
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:51,007
did you ever find out who
tipped off the cops?

353
00:32:55,375 --> 00:32:58,375
Don't try to guess
if you have absolutely no idea

354
00:32:59,042 --> 00:33:02,333
you're better off not knowing

355
00:33:02,833 --> 00:33:04,499
I want to know

356
00:33:05,542 --> 00:33:06,792
it was your fiancée

357
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:08,499
Amber

358
00:33:18,125 --> 00:33:19,875
I suppose I deserved it

359
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:27,666
ls there a chance for one more job,
so I can score a big one before I retire?

360
00:33:27,667 --> 00:33:29,166
Of course!

361
00:33:29,167 --> 00:33:32,832
If you combine these three artefacts, it'd take
you lifetimes to spend what "Gaia" is worth

362
00:33:32,833 --> 00:33:35,208
all we need now is the "rope of life"

363
00:33:35,958 --> 00:33:38,041
you have to be sure about this

364
00:33:38,917 --> 00:33:40,157
there can't be anymore missteps

365
00:33:46,542 --> 00:33:48,042
you know what's fascinating

366
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:50,125
about nesting dolls?

367
00:33:50,917 --> 00:33:53,583
You begin by making the smallest one

368
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,541
the shape and size of this core figure

369
00:33:57,208 --> 00:33:58,749
determines the fate

370
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,458
of the rest of the dolls that follow

371
00:34:01,292 --> 00:34:02,625
it's interesting, isn't it

372
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,041
that's destiny

373
00:34:07,667 --> 00:34:09,000
understood

374
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:13,833
let's hear the plan

375
00:34:16,125 --> 00:34:18,499
now that you've taken the cheque

376
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,500
why not get out of the game
while you still can?

377
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:22,208
What can I say

378
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,375
I'm greedy and I like money

379
00:34:24,958 --> 00:34:27,749
a fortune is worthless to a dead man

380
00:34:29,125 --> 00:34:31,750
do you really believe that
Amber betrayed you that day?

381
00:34:32,125 --> 00:34:34,416
You wanted to retire because of her

382
00:34:35,083 --> 00:34:36,416
Amber is a good person, and I'm a thief

383
00:34:36,417 --> 00:34:37,958
but I can't fool her forever

384
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:47,500
we're being tailed, don't look back

385
00:34:47,833 --> 00:34:49,208
let's split up

386
00:34:50,208 --> 00:34:52,374
okay. See you later

387
00:35:28,792 --> 00:35:29,750
give it to me

388
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:30,750
give you what?

389
00:35:30,751 --> 00:35:33,416
The "eye of forest",
the "wings of destiny", Tingting's necklace

390
00:35:34,458 --> 00:35:36,833
you're so sure that I'm responsible

391
00:35:37,875 --> 00:35:39,555
why would they lock you up if you weren't?

392
00:35:39,583 --> 00:35:41,166
You never gave me a chance to explain

393
00:35:41,167 --> 00:35:42,666
you've never visited me
once in the past five years

394
00:35:42,667 --> 00:35:44,083
I'm not gonna listen
to your so-called explanations

395
00:35:44,333 --> 00:35:45,791
then what are you doing here?

396
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:48,124
I'm helping the police
with their investigation

397
00:35:48,125 --> 00:35:50,666
so they will lock you up for good

398
00:35:57,083 --> 00:35:59,999
if they have any evidence that I did it

399
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,458
they can come and arrest me

400
00:36:04,625 --> 00:36:06,291
stop following me

401
00:36:22,167 --> 00:36:23,125
it's complete

402
00:36:23,167 --> 00:36:24,250
yes

403
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,416
interesting

404
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:43,333
enough

405
00:36:44,167 --> 00:36:45,292
try this one

406
00:36:56,583 --> 00:36:57,624
"Gaia"

407
00:36:59,833 --> 00:37:01,749
look in the most recent folder

408
00:37:03,042 --> 00:37:03,833
that's him

409
00:37:03,834 --> 00:37:06,124
the guy who owns the "rope of life"

410
00:37:06,167 --> 00:37:07,250
you know him?

411
00:37:07,417 --> 00:37:08,458
I've met him briefly

412
00:37:10,375 --> 00:37:12,125
that's pretty high tech

413
00:37:13,167 --> 00:37:15,667
should we tell Kong that we're backing out?

414
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:17,125
No

415
00:37:17,125 --> 00:37:17,833
Why?

416
00:37:17,834 --> 00:37:19,333
The operation is compromised

417
00:37:19,458 --> 00:37:20,957
scrap the original plan

418
00:37:20,958 --> 00:37:22,499
we're going for plan B

419
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:23,708
plan B?

420
00:37:56,167 --> 00:37:57,583
Nature calls

421
00:38:10,167 --> 00:38:11,542
you don't need to go?

422
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:13,833
I'll hold it in

423
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,833
they say holding it in is bad for you

424
00:38:22,375 --> 00:38:24,125
I knew this would happen

425
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:31,958
what is this?

426
00:38:32,958 --> 00:38:35,499
A female urination device
for the wilderness

427
00:38:35,958 --> 00:38:37,874
now you can pee standing up

428
00:38:37,875 --> 00:38:38,666
what do you think?

429
00:38:38,667 --> 00:38:40,375
Now we can pee together standing up

430
00:38:42,042 --> 00:38:43,667
are you insane?

431
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,250
What's that?

432
00:38:50,375 --> 00:38:52,125
A female urination device

433
00:38:53,042 --> 00:38:54,208
ls it useful?

434
00:38:55,042 --> 00:38:56,333
You're sick

435
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:25,416
Po

436
00:39:30,583 --> 00:39:31,749
Come on

437
00:39:56,625 --> 00:39:57,833
that's him?

438
00:40:01,458 --> 00:40:02,749
Whatever you do

439
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:03,916
find out as much as you
can about the castle

440
00:40:03,917 --> 00:40:05,708
and where he keeps the "rope of life"

441
00:40:06,208 --> 00:40:07,749
piece of cake

442
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,000
buddy“.

443
00:41:06,001 --> 00:41:07,208
Stop...

444
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,666
Stop!

445
00:41:21,833 --> 00:41:23,083
What was that?

446
00:41:27,292 --> 00:41:28,707
That was your plan?

447
00:41:28,708 --> 00:41:30,291
To not talk to him?

448
00:41:30,292 --> 00:41:32,417
How are we gonna be
able to get the "rope of life"?

449
00:41:32,792 --> 00:41:34,000
Let's go

450
00:41:35,375 --> 00:41:37,541
you'll never understand
what women are thinking!

451
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,583
Mr. law, please, a word?

452
00:41:48,833 --> 00:41:50,041
Sir

453
00:41:50,042 --> 00:41:52,625
are you still the owner
of the "rope of life"?

454
00:41:55,292 --> 00:41:58,125
I believe you've been
targeted by a group of thieves

455
00:42:00,917 --> 00:42:03,082
these are no ordinary thieves

456
00:42:03,083 --> 00:42:07,374
they have already stolen the two
other components that make up "Gaia"

457
00:42:08,167 --> 00:42:09,416
I see

458
00:42:09,417 --> 00:42:11,375
now all they need is yours

459
00:42:12,333 --> 00:42:13,874
inspector

460
00:42:13,875 --> 00:42:16,207
if they can get pass the state of the art

461
00:42:16,208 --> 00:42:18,874
security systems I installed

462
00:42:19,292 --> 00:42:20,875
let them have it

463
00:42:21,208 --> 00:42:23,249
excuse's moi

464
00:42:27,958 --> 00:42:29,208
prick

465
00:42:31,542 --> 00:42:32,667
hi

466
00:42:56,917 --> 00:42:58,667
Have we met before?

467
00:43:00,375 --> 00:43:03,708
Is that the best pick up line
you can come up with?

468
00:43:08,833 --> 00:43:10,083
What's wrong?

469
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:11,916
Is it the wine?

470
00:43:13,125 --> 00:43:16,166
It's not the wine. It's the venue

471
00:43:19,125 --> 00:43:20,625
what's wrong with the venue?

472
00:43:21,333 --> 00:43:24,374
People need to be in a certain mood
to enjoy fine wine

473
00:43:24,958 --> 00:43:27,166
the place is nice enough

474
00:43:27,167 --> 00:43:29,917
but it's lacking two key elements

475
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:31,791
and what might those be?

476
00:43:33,958 --> 00:43:35,207
Music and...

477
00:43:35,208 --> 00:43:36,208
Friends

478
00:43:38,625 --> 00:43:40,166
not only do you know wine

479
00:43:40,167 --> 00:43:41,625
you know how to enjoy life

480
00:43:43,292 --> 00:43:44,749
let me introduce myself

481
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:45,916
Charlie law

482
00:43:45,917 --> 00:43:47,458
I own this winery

483
00:43:47,917 --> 00:43:49,458
I've heard all about you

484
00:43:50,125 --> 00:43:51,916
I work for a wine magazine

485
00:43:51,917 --> 00:43:53,083
rose

486
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,125
I'm a wine critic

487
00:43:56,292 --> 00:43:59,250
I assume I won't be
getting a good review from you

488
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:01,750
sorry

489
00:44:01,958 --> 00:44:03,916
- it was nice meeting you, I should go
- wait

490
00:44:14,292 --> 00:44:15,583
now that we have music

491
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:17,958
all you need is a companion

492
00:44:18,583 --> 00:44:19,916
care to be my friend?

493
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:23,583
I already have plenty of friends

494
00:44:23,708 --> 00:44:25,208
how about

495
00:44:25,667 --> 00:44:27,833
we do an interview?

496
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,458
Would you be interested?

497
00:44:34,667 --> 00:44:35,667
Call me

498
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:37,333
bye

499
00:44:58,208 --> 00:44:59,916
why isn't he calling?

500
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,291
He will soon

501
00:45:03,042 --> 00:45:05,249
how do you know he'll call?

502
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:07,791
How do you know he won't?

503
00:45:08,125 --> 00:45:08,958
He...

504
00:45:08,959 --> 00:45:10,541
"It's me Charlie. I'll call you now"

505
00:45:12,375 --> 00:45:13,708
see?

506
00:45:18,792 --> 00:45:20,083
Hello?

507
00:45:20,625 --> 00:45:22,832
Hi, rose. It's Charlie

508
00:45:22,833 --> 00:45:23,958
hey, what's up?

509
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,458
I'd like to schedule the interview

510
00:45:27,625 --> 00:45:28,625
tomorrow

511
00:45:28,708 --> 00:45:29,458
great!

512
00:45:29,458 --> 00:45:30,458
I'm busy

513
00:45:32,958 --> 00:45:34,082
the day after tomorrow?

514
00:45:34,083 --> 00:45:34,916
Sure

515
00:45:34,917 --> 00:45:37,833
would you like to come to my office?

516
00:45:42,542 --> 00:45:43,750
Text me the address

517
00:45:44,542 --> 00:45:46,000
my driver can pick you up

518
00:45:46,792 --> 00:45:47,833
why'd you hang up?

519
00:45:48,625 --> 00:45:50,583
He didn't even finish

520
00:45:51,083 --> 00:45:53,083
you're so annoying

521
00:45:53,875 --> 00:45:54,875
wait! Where are you going?

522
00:45:54,876 --> 00:45:57,166
Checking whether the facial mask
worked its magic

523
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,083
he's calling back!

524
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:02,750
You answer it

525
00:46:06,333 --> 00:46:07,499
she was just...

526
00:46:32,583 --> 00:46:34,874
Could you please stop doing that?

527
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:37,208
Sorry, stress relief

528
00:46:38,083 --> 00:46:39,791
doctor's orders

529
00:46:40,292 --> 00:46:41,583
does it work?

530
00:46:41,833 --> 00:46:43,291
Not really

531
00:46:53,208 --> 00:46:56,499
you seem really obsessed with him. Why?

532
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:59,249
I'm not obsessed. He's a thief, I'm a cop

533
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:01,291
my duty is to catch him

534
00:47:01,292 --> 00:47:02,458
that's it

535
00:47:18,417 --> 00:47:20,833
I'm just curious

536
00:47:22,333 --> 00:47:23,541
sorry

537
00:47:24,292 --> 00:47:26,208
if I made you uncomfortable

538
00:47:32,167 --> 00:47:35,249
you know when
Zhang stole the "eye of the forest"

539
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:38,000
I chased him through the streets of Paris

540
00:47:38,708 --> 00:47:40,374
almost had him

541
00:47:41,167 --> 00:47:43,292
when a car crashed into me

542
00:47:43,583 --> 00:47:46,083
I was trapped in the wreckage

543
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:48,958
I thought for sure I was going to die

544
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:56,291
you know why I want to get him so bad?

545
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,207
Because he's the worst
kind of thief there is

546
00:49:00,208 --> 00:49:03,958
the kind that has Patience, and integrity

547
00:49:04,667 --> 00:49:07,375
the kind that if I don't get him now

548
00:49:07,542 --> 00:49:10,417
I'm afraid I won't ever get him

549
00:49:31,792 --> 00:49:32,792
it's her

550
00:49:33,208 --> 00:49:34,541
now what?

551
00:49:34,542 --> 00:49:36,875
We wait and we follow her

552
00:49:39,792 --> 00:49:41,250
there's interference in the feed

553
00:49:44,625 --> 00:49:45,916
how about now?

554
00:49:49,708 --> 00:49:50,708
Good

555
00:50:06,333 --> 00:50:07,791
this way please

556
00:50:09,625 --> 00:50:11,624
take a good look

557
00:50:11,625 --> 00:50:12,791
copy

558
00:50:25,208 --> 00:50:26,608
you mind if I record the interview?

559
00:50:27,417 --> 00:50:28,583
Not at all

560
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:32,125
alright

561
00:50:32,126 --> 00:50:33,916
let's begin

562
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,041
Mr. law, what year were you born?

563
00:50:37,542 --> 00:50:38,542
1978

564
00:50:39,208 --> 00:50:41,583
on the 31st of this month

565
00:50:42,083 --> 00:50:44,249
I'm throwing myself a birthday party here

566
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:45,875
I'd like for you to be there

567
00:50:46,875 --> 00:50:47,999
maybe

568
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,680
let's get on with the interview, shall we?

569
00:50:51,167 --> 00:50:52,999
When was the first time you tasted wine?

570
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
16 years old

571
00:50:54,208 --> 00:50:55,624
do you remember what kind it was?

572
00:50:55,875 --> 00:50:58,333
No, but it was expensive for sure

573
00:50:59,167 --> 00:51:01,007
so as long as the wine's
expensive, it's good?

574
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:04,833
Not just wine, it applies to everything

575
00:51:06,083 --> 00:51:07,916
money means a lot to you, doesn't it

576
00:51:07,917 --> 00:51:09,250
of course

577
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:11,833
Mr. law

578
00:51:11,834 --> 00:51:15,291
how would you describe your occupation?

579
00:51:15,792 --> 00:51:16,792
Making money

580
00:51:17,042 --> 00:51:18,916
big and small

581
00:51:18,917 --> 00:51:20,291
for example this castle

582
00:51:20,292 --> 00:51:24,083
I live here
but I also open parts of it for tourists

583
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:27,750
what's the most valuable item
in your collection?

584
00:51:34,917 --> 00:51:37,250
Have you heard of the "rope of life"?

585
00:51:38,625 --> 00:51:42,500
No, but now that you mention it...

586
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:45,416
I have an idea

587
00:51:45,583 --> 00:51:48,249
how about I take a picture of you
and the "rope of life"?

588
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:51,166
It'd make the article more enticing

589
00:51:52,292 --> 00:51:53,458
now?

590
00:51:54,125 --> 00:51:55,125
Yes

591
00:51:55,875 --> 00:51:56,875
sure

592
00:51:57,250 --> 00:51:58,500
follow me

593
00:51:58,833 --> 00:52:00,041
right this way

594
00:52:01,875 --> 00:52:03,666
it's secret passage

595
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:08,000
must be standard for the rich

596
00:52:10,125 --> 00:52:13,041
your security system here
must be one of a kind

597
00:52:13,042 --> 00:52:16,207
everything is linked up to
the security control center

598
00:52:16,208 --> 00:52:17,499
there are cameras in there

599
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,541
that are connected to my cell phone

600
00:52:19,833 --> 00:52:21,458
good morning, Mr. law

601
00:52:28,875 --> 00:52:30,500
here is my collection

602
00:52:31,333 --> 00:52:33,166
out of all the artefacts

603
00:52:33,458 --> 00:52:36,041
this is my favorite

604
00:52:40,167 --> 00:52:41,542
it's stunning

605
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:44,500
it must be very expensive

606
00:52:45,292 --> 00:52:48,417
a lot of people
would kill to get their hands on it

607
00:52:48,833 --> 00:52:51,541
as it's one of the most coveted
pieces of jewelry in the world

608
00:52:54,917 --> 00:52:57,083
buddy is my most trusted
security team member

609
00:52:57,875 --> 00:52:59,875
yes, we've met before

610
00:53:01,083 --> 00:53:02,999
buddy is actually very friendly

611
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,499
he's just a little playful sometimes

612
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:05,750
try calling his name

613
00:53:08,958 --> 00:53:10,166
buddy!

614
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,207
Let's start talking some pictures

615
00:53:16,208 --> 00:53:17,333
okay

616
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:20,750
alright

617
00:53:21,792 --> 00:53:23,000
ready

618
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:31,791
sorry, there's a reflection

619
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:33,666
from the glass

620
00:53:33,667 --> 00:53:35,042
no problem, I can open it up

621
00:53:44,333 --> 00:53:45,791
looks very high tech

622
00:53:46,042 --> 00:53:47,375
alright, again

623
00:53:48,042 --> 00:53:51,500
give me a high-spirited pose

624
00:53:51,833 --> 00:53:53,041
wait a minute

625
00:53:54,792 --> 00:53:56,042
fine

626
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:57,750
alright

627
00:53:58,583 --> 00:54:01,499
give me a pose with a homely feeling

628
00:54:03,958 --> 00:54:05,249
perfect. Now some full body shots

629
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:06,416
great

630
00:54:07,417 --> 00:54:08,458
let me get a top shot

631
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:15,833
sure

632
00:54:17,083 --> 00:54:19,749
imagine you're presenting it with pride

633
00:54:23,167 --> 00:54:25,208
can you step to your left?

634
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:28,458
A little more

635
00:54:32,833 --> 00:54:34,291
just a little more

636
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,291
more?

637
00:54:36,583 --> 00:54:38,249
Are you sure you can still see me?

638
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:40,041
Perfect from this angle

639
00:54:46,542 --> 00:54:50,957
during the Nazi occupation of
Czechoslovakia in world war <i>ll</i>

640
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:53,707
the castle was inhabited by the Nazis

641
00:54:53,708 --> 00:54:56,541
an underground secret passageway
was built as an escape route

642
00:54:56,542 --> 00:54:58,374
it connects the basement of the castle
all the way to the winery

643
00:54:58,375 --> 00:55:02,250
in fact, the wine cellar
was used as a bomb shelter

644
00:55:11,583 --> 00:55:14,124
here she is, coming out

645
00:55:57,542 --> 00:55:58,833
that's way off

646
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,500
hello inspector

647
00:56:05,792 --> 00:56:10,292
I see your time behind bars
did little to rehabilitate you

648
00:56:10,917 --> 00:56:12,375
not true

649
00:56:12,875 --> 00:56:14,583
I tried painting

650
00:56:15,208 --> 00:56:17,999
but I'm just better
at stealing art than making it

651
00:56:18,667 --> 00:56:21,042
once a thief, always a thief

652
00:56:22,292 --> 00:56:23,875
easy

653
00:56:24,583 --> 00:56:27,749
I wouldn't be here if I didn't want to talk

654
00:56:28,208 --> 00:56:29,374
I'm listening

655
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Amber

656
00:56:31,292 --> 00:56:33,042
that's your business

657
00:56:33,583 --> 00:56:35,541
mine is to bring you in

658
00:56:35,875 --> 00:56:38,291
you dragged her into this mess

659
00:56:38,875 --> 00:56:41,250
that makes it your business

660
00:56:42,792 --> 00:56:44,125
give this to her

661
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,083
and keep her out of this

662
00:56:49,292 --> 00:56:50,708
what's going on?

663
00:56:59,417 --> 00:57:01,042
He still cares for you

664
00:57:04,708 --> 00:57:09,208
you said you know how
it feels to be betrayed

665
00:57:10,417 --> 00:57:11,708
who was it?

666
00:57:13,208 --> 00:57:16,458
Since when are you interested in bonding?

667
00:57:20,167 --> 00:57:23,500
When I was a boy,
my father was the greatest man I knew

668
00:57:23,958 --> 00:57:26,291
everybody loved him, respected him

669
00:57:26,833 --> 00:57:29,749
he traveled a lot... For work he said

670
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:33,416
used to bring me trinkets and tell me that

671
00:57:33,417 --> 00:57:36,875
one day I'd go with him

672
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,458
I was 14 when the police came

673
00:57:44,875 --> 00:57:47,541
raided our home and seized everything

674
00:57:50,958 --> 00:57:55,291
I don't know if the trinkets
he gave me were stolen or not

675
00:57:56,417 --> 00:57:57,875
doesn't matter

676
00:58:04,292 --> 00:58:06,250
cops took them all away

677
00:58:06,833 --> 00:58:08,458
my dad too

678
00:58:09,375 --> 00:58:11,041
he went to jail

679
00:58:12,875 --> 00:58:14,833
left us with nothing

680
00:58:21,792 --> 00:58:24,042
did you ever confront your father?

681
00:58:24,917 --> 00:58:26,542
He died in prison

682
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:32,916
people like Zhang and my father
they destroy lives

683
00:58:33,292 --> 00:58:35,958
it isn't just objects they steal

684
00:58:36,333 --> 00:58:38,416
it is trust as well

685
00:58:40,917 --> 00:58:43,125
well, I don't have to tell you this

686
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:50,958
why did you agree to help me?

687
00:58:59,625 --> 00:59:01,000
One day

688
00:59:01,792 --> 00:59:04,083
someone offers you an opportunity

689
00:59:04,458 --> 00:59:07,124
to put away someone you
tried so hard to forget

690
00:59:07,333 --> 00:59:08,666
but couldn't

691
00:59:10,292 --> 00:59:14,417
so you take it,
because it is the right thing to do

692
00:59:15,417 --> 00:59:19,458
I just didn't realize how hard it would be

693
00:59:22,875 --> 00:59:24,916
as much as I hate him

694
00:59:26,708 --> 00:59:27,666
I still...

695
00:59:27,667 --> 00:59:29,292
Say no more

696
00:59:29,458 --> 00:59:30,874
I understand

697
00:59:38,042 --> 00:59:42,167
it looks like our pal Charlie's
throwing a party at the castle

698
00:59:42,417 --> 00:59:43,417
I have to go

699
00:59:43,792 --> 00:59:45,083
I'm going with you

700
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:49,042
I want to

701
00:59:57,250 --> 00:59:58,250
he)'

702
00:59:58,458 --> 01:00:01,749
what kind of fingerprint scanner is this?

703
01:00:02,042 --> 01:00:03,791
It's a pain to wear

704
01:00:03,792 --> 01:00:05,041
help me lace this up

705
01:00:05,042 --> 01:00:06,208
come on

706
01:00:26,708 --> 01:00:29,624
this is a high-risk operation

707
01:00:29,833 --> 01:00:32,249
which operation isn't?

708
01:00:33,958 --> 01:00:35,374
If anything happens

709
01:00:35,958 --> 01:00:39,249
I mean, if one of us gets caught

710
01:00:40,958 --> 01:00:42,499
I can't save you

711
01:00:43,375 --> 01:00:45,041
you don't have to save me either

712
01:00:45,667 --> 01:00:47,625
this is a rule set by Zhang

713
01:00:49,208 --> 01:00:51,166
that's a strange rule

714
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:55,291
it's too tight

715
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:11,750
let's give it a try

716
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:26,125
you need to hold on tighter

717
01:01:40,708 --> 01:01:42,999
what are all these red flags?

718
01:01:43,333 --> 01:01:45,249
Surveillance cameras

719
01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:48,624
their range is around 5o meters

720
01:01:48,625 --> 01:01:51,041
and they cover
the whole perimeter of the castle

721
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:54,667
that's really difficult to get in

722
01:01:55,042 --> 01:01:57,542
that's why we won't be
going in on ground level

723
01:01:57,958 --> 01:01:59,374
then how would we get in?

724
01:01:59,625 --> 01:02:01,291
Getting inside is not impossible

725
01:02:03,333 --> 01:02:05,916
we can enter from the winery

726
01:02:06,542 --> 01:02:08,042
that's adjacent to the castle

727
01:02:15,667 --> 01:02:18,625
in there? Are we gonna suffocate to death?

728
01:02:29,167 --> 01:02:31,042
The winery needs some new barrels

729
01:02:31,792 --> 01:02:35,042
that's how demon will sneak us in

730
01:02:39,875 --> 01:02:42,375
the manhole leads directly
to the underground passageway

731
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:48,583
that will take us
to the castle's security control center

732
01:02:49,708 --> 01:02:50,708
Po

733
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:02,166
Once I get there, I'll take out the guards

734
01:03:04,875 --> 01:03:07,916
then turn off the surveillance cameras
and the security system

735
01:03:09,417 --> 01:03:13,417
happy birthday to you

736
01:03:21,083 --> 01:03:24,458
Zhang will enter the vault
from the watchtower

737
01:03:24,542 --> 01:03:25,792
exactly

738
01:03:39,875 --> 01:03:41,000
got it

739
01:04:33,333 --> 01:04:35,749
and who's going to open the vault?

740
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:40,750
You've already planted the seed

741
01:05:08,375 --> 01:05:09,708
laser system is down

742
01:05:46,125 --> 01:05:47,625
you look absolutely gorgeous today

743
01:05:48,208 --> 01:05:49,583
thank you

744
01:05:50,417 --> 01:05:51,582
I know that you've got everything

745
01:05:51,583 --> 01:05:53,666
so I didn't bring a present

746
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,120
you coming tonight is
the best present I could ask for

747
01:05:59,083 --> 01:06:00,374
happy birthday

748
01:06:00,625 --> 01:06:01,916
thank you

749
01:07:47,542 --> 01:07:48,875
scared the crap out of me

750
01:07:50,542 --> 01:07:51,958
what the hell just happened?

751
01:07:53,333 --> 01:07:54,874
It's a long story

752
01:07:54,875 --> 01:07:57,250
go... Go

753
01:08:07,125 --> 01:08:10,624
women are just gifts to you, aren't they?

754
01:08:10,625 --> 01:08:11,791
Of course not

755
01:08:11,792 --> 01:08:13,000
then what are they?

756
01:08:13,125 --> 01:08:14,541
Like you

757
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:16,333
they should be gift receivers

758
01:08:28,917 --> 01:08:30,375
the scan failed

759
01:08:31,167 --> 01:08:32,167
try it again

760
01:08:42,542 --> 01:08:44,083
so you have a gift for me?

761
01:08:55,750 --> 01:08:57,791
Let's go back to China together

762
01:08:58,708 --> 01:09:00,083
wearing the "rope of life"

763
01:09:10,875 --> 01:09:12,124
okay, it's done

764
01:09:12,125 --> 01:09:13,125
say goodbye

765
01:09:15,958 --> 01:09:17,624
excuse me, I need to use the bathroom

766
01:09:22,750 --> 01:09:24,083
transmitting

767
01:09:31,375 --> 01:09:32,750
I'm outside the vault

768
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:38,666
time for spidey

769
01:10:14,667 --> 01:10:16,875
what's happening?

770
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:20,750
Charlie's dog is attacking spidey

771
01:10:21,667 --> 01:10:24,167
we're running out of time

772
01:10:27,708 --> 01:10:29,374
sorry doggy

773
01:10:29,625 --> 01:10:31,041
you made me do this

774
01:11:09,792 --> 01:11:11,125
Mr. law

775
01:11:11,542 --> 01:11:13,374
the policeman is here again

776
01:11:13,375 --> 01:11:15,083
he says it's urgent

777
01:11:18,375 --> 01:11:19,791
Mr. law

778
01:11:36,708 --> 01:11:38,541
Zhang, your old friend is here

779
01:11:40,125 --> 01:11:42,000
Po, we're running out of time

780
01:12:39,542 --> 01:12:40,583
red is in trouble

781
01:12:47,375 --> 01:12:49,000
send over the fingerprints

782
01:12:49,375 --> 01:12:50,291
Zhang

783
01:12:50,292 --> 01:12:51,458
now!

784
01:12:53,042 --> 01:12:54,333
So I'm just part of your plan

785
01:12:56,250 --> 01:12:57,833
check your vault

786
01:13:00,958 --> 01:13:02,666
everything is fine

787
01:13:06,667 --> 01:13:08,042
buddy?

788
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:11,583
You've been robbed right under your nose

789
01:13:12,750 --> 01:13:14,041
come with me

790
01:13:14,375 --> 01:13:15,500
they're heading your way

791
01:13:32,458 --> 01:13:33,707
they will reach you soon

792
01:13:33,708 --> 01:13:35,041
get yourself out of there

793
01:13:40,208 --> 01:13:41,249
what about red?

794
01:13:42,625 --> 01:13:45,375
Leave now! Before they catch you

795
01:13:55,292 --> 01:13:56,583
find them!

796
01:13:57,125 --> 01:13:58,250
Alert, all personnel!

797
01:14:16,958 --> 01:14:18,916
What about the rule?

798
01:14:18,958 --> 01:14:20,582
I broke it, but don't fall in love with me

799
01:14:20,583 --> 01:14:21,624
let's go

800
01:16:05,417 --> 01:16:06,417
wait

801
01:16:06,542 --> 01:16:07,917
I won't kill him

802
01:17:05,917 --> 01:17:08,458
I don't know how to swim!

803
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:40,666
Don't move!

804
01:17:41,167 --> 01:17:43,000
Stay on your knees

805
01:17:48,458 --> 01:17:50,291
you will have to kill me

806
01:17:50,875 --> 01:17:52,374
you think I won't?

807
01:17:52,375 --> 01:17:53,375
Try me

808
01:18:02,167 --> 01:18:03,875
don't be stupid

809
01:18:04,083 --> 01:18:05,708
think of Amber

810
01:18:07,458 --> 01:18:09,499
ls that why you brought her?

811
01:18:11,667 --> 01:18:13,875
You're smarter than I thought

812
01:18:24,833 --> 01:18:25,916
get in

813
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,541
what are you looking at?

814
01:19:02,125 --> 01:19:04,208
Nothing, I just don't get it

815
01:19:05,083 --> 01:19:07,458
you saving me makes me think that

816
01:19:08,208 --> 01:19:10,333
there's still a possibility
to make this work

817
01:19:15,458 --> 01:19:17,791
can I be together with a thief?

818
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,625
You haven't changed one bit

819
01:19:23,250 --> 01:19:25,416
I need to find the guy who screwed me over

820
01:19:27,125 --> 01:19:29,249
without the complete "Gaia",
he won't show himself

821
01:19:29,250 --> 01:19:33,250
if he doesn't die, then
I can't live in peace

822
01:19:41,708 --> 01:19:43,041
are you okay?

823
01:19:43,708 --> 01:19:44,999
I'm alright

824
01:19:45,250 --> 01:19:46,750
but you're in a bit of a pickle

825
01:19:47,333 --> 01:19:49,041
you just became an accomplice

826
01:19:57,875 --> 01:19:58,875
hey!

827
01:20:01,125 --> 01:20:02,291
Hey!

828
01:20:03,042 --> 01:20:04,374
You alright?

829
01:20:04,375 --> 01:20:05,666
I'm good

830
01:20:05,667 --> 01:20:07,125
only one parachute left

831
01:20:09,917 --> 01:20:12,333
go with them, I'll follow after

832
01:20:14,792 --> 01:20:16,082
I'm not going with them

833
01:20:16,083 --> 01:20:17,916
listen to me

834
01:20:18,250 --> 01:20:20,125
just let me talk to Kong

835
01:20:21,125 --> 01:20:24,625
I'll figure everything out
and explain later, okay?

836
01:20:28,333 --> 01:20:29,624
Go

837
01:20:31,292 --> 01:20:32,792
I'll save you the trip

838
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,333
Zhang

839
01:20:45,750 --> 01:20:50,250
did you forget about your uncle
because of this woman?

840
01:20:55,667 --> 01:20:57,083
I have what you want

841
01:20:57,708 --> 01:20:59,041
hand it over

842
01:20:59,042 --> 01:21:00,042
hold on

843
01:21:00,208 --> 01:21:02,374
you want the goods? Where is the money?

844
01:21:09,083 --> 01:21:10,208
Hand me the goods

845
01:21:10,458 --> 01:21:14,291
no, there's no turning back
if you give it to him

846
01:21:17,167 --> 01:21:18,583
come on, bring it over

847
01:21:22,250 --> 01:21:23,458
he was talking to me

848
01:21:25,250 --> 01:21:27,416
red? What are you doing?

849
01:21:28,958 --> 01:21:30,166
He hired me first

850
01:21:41,750 --> 01:21:43,458
take her with us

851
01:21:44,458 --> 01:21:45,458
Amber!

852
01:22:13,458 --> 01:22:15,124
Think twice before snitching
when you're in jail

853
01:22:15,125 --> 01:22:16,916
I have her as leverage

854
01:22:21,125 --> 01:22:24,041
Po, use spidey!

855
01:22:45,833 --> 01:22:48,582
Hands up! Get down on the ground!

856
01:22:48,583 --> 01:22:49,916
Now!

857
01:22:54,958 --> 01:22:57,458
Go now, make sure you find her

858
01:22:59,750 --> 01:23:00,910
- what about you?
- Just jump!

859
01:23:30,417 --> 01:23:33,000
Still refusing to cooperate?

860
01:23:38,875 --> 01:23:40,041
Five minutes

861
01:23:40,042 --> 01:23:41,292
okay

862
01:23:43,208 --> 01:23:44,666
where is "Gaia"?

863
01:23:45,708 --> 01:23:48,374
We know your mentor Kong has it

864
01:23:49,542 --> 01:23:51,833
go, take a break

865
01:23:55,458 --> 01:23:56,791
where is he?

866
01:23:58,667 --> 01:24:00,042
I don't know

867
01:24:00,417 --> 01:24:01,958
but I do know how to find him

868
01:24:02,417 --> 01:24:04,958
you can't get him without my help

869
01:24:05,667 --> 01:24:06,917
and Amber?

870
01:24:13,042 --> 01:24:14,958
Let me out of here

871
01:24:15,833 --> 01:24:17,833
I'll save her and take down Kong

872
01:24:20,625 --> 01:24:22,875
if we lose Kong this time

873
01:24:24,125 --> 01:24:25,750
he sells "Gaia"

874
01:24:26,125 --> 01:24:28,083
we will never find him

875
01:24:28,667 --> 01:24:29,875
never

876
01:24:31,875 --> 01:24:33,708
why should I trust you?

877
01:24:34,750 --> 01:24:37,041
Do you have another choice?

878
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:38,958
One condition

879
01:24:39,750 --> 01:24:41,416
bring back "Gaia"

880
01:25:42,125 --> 01:25:43,500
the buyer is here

881
01:25:44,250 --> 01:25:45,541
keep an eye on her

882
01:25:48,208 --> 01:25:49,374
uncle Kong

883
01:25:49,875 --> 01:25:51,500
I'll be there in bit

884
01:25:52,250 --> 01:25:53,458
be quick

885
01:26:04,333 --> 01:26:06,208
I'm going in, you stay here

886
01:26:09,292 --> 01:26:10,750
what about red...

887
01:26:11,708 --> 01:26:14,124
So what's the plan anyway?

888
01:26:16,167 --> 01:26:17,458
Plan B

889
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,000
hi

890
01:26:51,208 --> 01:26:52,374
Tell us

891
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:54,458
why did you side with Kong?

892
01:26:56,125 --> 01:26:57,541
He saved my life before

893
01:26:58,875 --> 01:27:01,791
there are many things
where we have no choice

894
01:28:11,208 --> 01:28:12,999
the universe depends on a balance

895
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,458
and we are all subject to Karma

896
01:28:17,917 --> 01:28:19,000
Karma leads us to

897
01:28:19,167 --> 01:28:20,583
where we are now

898
01:28:21,625 --> 01:28:23,083
you wouldn't be here

899
01:28:23,417 --> 01:28:24,917
without me

900
01:28:27,375 --> 01:28:28,666
five years

901
01:28:28,833 --> 01:28:30,374
have I not repaid my debt to you?

902
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:35,375
There is no such thing
as "paying back" in a family

903
01:28:37,417 --> 01:28:39,137
what are you planning to pay her back with?

904
01:28:41,750 --> 01:28:43,332
Great

905
01:28:43,333 --> 01:28:44,458
everyone's here

906
01:28:45,542 --> 01:28:47,083
it's a family reunion

907
01:28:49,042 --> 01:28:51,958
let me tell you

908
01:28:53,625 --> 01:28:55,207
the Russian doll behind you

909
01:28:55,208 --> 01:28:57,083
ls a proximity bomb

910
01:28:57,708 --> 01:28:59,374
the distance sensor

911
01:28:59,375 --> 01:29:00,750
ls attached to "Gaia"

912
01:29:01,417 --> 01:29:03,250
once the transaction is done

913
01:29:04,083 --> 01:29:05,791
and "Gaia" gets out of a

914
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:06,916
one kilometer range

915
01:29:06,917 --> 01:29:08,208
the bomb will go off

916
01:29:12,833 --> 01:29:14,458
and this will be

917
01:29:15,292 --> 01:29:17,792
what you repay her with

918
01:29:25,208 --> 01:29:28,374
you stay here and watch them

919
01:29:29,208 --> 01:29:32,583
when I give the call, meet me downstairs

920
01:29:35,792 --> 01:29:37,042
understood

921
01:30:05,708 --> 01:30:06,958
hello!

922
01:30:10,083 --> 01:30:12,124
Your operation in the Czech Republic

923
01:30:12,125 --> 01:30:14,291
drew a lot of heat from the cops

924
01:30:14,292 --> 01:30:15,999
don't worry

925
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,958
this place is safe

926
01:30:18,625 --> 01:30:22,332
the original buyer
from the middle east got cold feet

927
01:30:22,333 --> 01:30:25,916
luckily I found a new buyer, Mr. Yelyuk

928
01:30:28,250 --> 01:30:29,707
last minute change in buyer

929
01:30:29,708 --> 01:30:31,041
ls not how we do business

930
01:30:31,333 --> 01:30:33,457
he's fine

931
01:30:33,458 --> 01:30:35,416
Mr. Yelyuk is a very rich man

932
01:30:35,875 --> 01:30:38,541
he's offering 20% more

933
01:30:40,833 --> 01:30:42,416
nothing to worry about

934
01:30:43,417 --> 01:30:45,917
you know what this machine does?

935
01:30:46,875 --> 01:30:48,750
It cuts Cannon barrels

936
01:30:49,333 --> 01:30:53,833
when I was a young man,
I used to work in a factory like this

937
01:30:57,208 --> 01:31:00,708
this damn thing can cut through anything

938
01:31:01,833 --> 01:31:04,708
I know you have something I want

939
01:31:05,625 --> 01:31:07,291
let's see it

940
01:31:17,750 --> 01:31:19,458
I was like you

941
01:31:20,375 --> 01:31:22,208
looked up to him like a father

942
01:31:23,750 --> 01:31:25,750
he sold me out five years ago

943
01:31:27,750 --> 01:31:29,291
looks like it's gonna be you this time

944
01:31:31,208 --> 01:31:33,458
save your story

945
01:31:34,167 --> 01:31:35,750
I only care about money

946
01:31:36,333 --> 01:31:37,874
think about it

947
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:40,791
why did he leave you here?

948
01:31:40,792 --> 01:31:42,124
You really believe after the transaction

949
01:31:42,125 --> 01:31:43,666
you will be getting your share?

950
01:31:44,167 --> 01:31:45,500
To him, you are one of us

951
01:31:48,042 --> 01:31:50,167
pull the trigger if you don't believe me

952
01:32:10,750 --> 01:32:12,083
take it easy

953
01:32:13,333 --> 01:32:15,249
just family business being taken care of

954
01:32:15,583 --> 01:32:17,166
family business

955
01:32:21,417 --> 01:32:22,958
lower your guns

956
01:32:24,542 --> 01:32:25,708
carry on

957
01:32:36,042 --> 01:32:37,375
proceed

958
01:32:45,833 --> 01:32:49,499
"bank transfer"

959
01:32:50,417 --> 01:32:52,333
hand over "Gaia"

960
01:32:54,250 --> 01:32:56,291
or I'll kill her

961
01:33:19,167 --> 01:33:20,875
you shot her down like a dog

962
01:33:23,833 --> 01:33:25,666
if she can't even handle a few of you

963
01:33:25,667 --> 01:33:27,125
what's the use of her

964
01:33:28,792 --> 01:33:30,583
what do you take us for?

965
01:33:30,958 --> 01:33:32,499
What do you take me for?

966
01:33:32,875 --> 01:33:34,416
If I raised a dog

967
01:33:34,417 --> 01:33:36,750
at least it would know how to fetch

968
01:33:36,917 --> 01:33:39,000
you left me for a bitch

969
01:33:39,333 --> 01:33:42,208
I have rules for training my dogs

970
01:33:42,583 --> 01:33:44,666
your rules don't apply to me

971
01:33:44,917 --> 01:33:45,917
why does it have to suit you?

972
01:33:45,918 --> 01:33:47,832
- Translate this to Yelyuk
- don%

973
01:33:47,833 --> 01:33:48,957
does he have a younger brother?

974
01:33:48,958 --> 01:33:49,874
Don't listen to him

975
01:33:49,875 --> 01:33:52,208
did his brother disappear five years ago?

976
01:33:52,375 --> 01:33:53,958
- Shut up!
- Hold on

977
01:33:55,750 --> 01:33:57,041
I'll listen

978
01:33:57,833 --> 01:33:59,249
five years ago

979
01:33:59,625 --> 01:34:01,583
after I stole the "eye
of the forest" for him

980
01:34:02,625 --> 01:34:04,166
I was ambushed

981
01:34:05,125 --> 01:34:07,125
by a thief

982
01:34:07,542 --> 01:34:09,142
he stole the "eye of the forest" from me

983
01:34:09,417 --> 01:34:11,292
Kong had him murdered

984
01:34:11,958 --> 01:34:13,541
so what?

985
01:34:14,667 --> 01:34:15,916
The problem is

986
01:34:15,917 --> 01:34:18,083
that thief was his brother

987
01:34:18,458 --> 01:34:19,916
would you come here if you knew?

988
01:34:22,375 --> 01:34:23,958
How do you know this?

989
01:34:24,250 --> 01:34:25,875
Kong not only killed your brother

990
01:34:27,083 --> 01:34:28,916
he also cut off his tongue

991
01:34:30,417 --> 01:34:32,292
his tongue had a tattoo

992
01:34:32,583 --> 01:34:34,624
just like the one you have on your neck

993
01:34:38,583 --> 01:34:40,583
I didn't know he was your brother

994
01:34:40,792 --> 01:34:42,499
he stole from me so I killed him.

995
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:43,541
That's the rule of the game

996
01:34:43,542 --> 01:34:44,708
you can understand that, right?

997
01:34:44,792 --> 01:34:46,667
You are the one not playing by the rules

998
01:34:48,625 --> 01:34:50,375
you hired his brother

999
01:34:50,833 --> 01:34:52,666
- and then you killed him
- shut up

1000
01:34:56,875 --> 01:34:58,000
how dare you shoot at me?

1001
01:35:01,458 --> 01:35:03,916
I should be asking you that question

1002
01:35:13,833 --> 01:35:15,166
listen carefully

1003
01:35:15,167 --> 01:35:17,250
I am risking my life to come here

1004
01:35:18,625 --> 01:35:19,874
you are right

1005
01:35:19,875 --> 01:35:22,083
Kong is the one who betrayed you

1006
01:35:24,750 --> 01:35:27,291
he hired the eastern European boy

1007
01:35:27,292 --> 01:35:29,125
to steal the "eye of the forest" from you

1008
01:35:46,125 --> 01:35:47,708
what are you afraid of?

1009
01:35:47,875 --> 01:35:48,875
Shoot me

1010
01:36:10,875 --> 01:36:12,875
he's all yours

1011
01:36:16,875 --> 01:36:20,500
remember what I said about that machine?

1012
01:36:21,583 --> 01:36:26,083
It cuts through anything

1013
01:36:30,333 --> 01:36:31,749
Spideys ready!

1014
01:36:33,833 --> 01:36:34,916
Three

1015
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,083
two

1016
01:36:38,208 --> 01:36:39,249
one

1017
01:37:04,708 --> 01:37:05,874
stand still

1018
01:37:06,542 --> 01:37:07,542
stand still

1019
01:37:09,542 --> 01:37:11,000
come out now

1020
01:37:13,542 --> 01:37:15,042
come out, you traitors

1021
01:37:15,250 --> 01:37:16,250
I will kill you

1022
01:37:16,958 --> 01:37:18,583
hand over "Gaia" to me

1023
01:37:48,667 --> 01:37:49,792
go!

1024
01:38:14,083 --> 01:38:15,708
Stop the car!

1025
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:23,000
"One kilometer"

1026
01:38:33,417 --> 01:38:36,958
he was defeated by his own greed

1027
01:38:37,583 --> 01:38:39,291
how are we going to keep you free

1028
01:38:40,333 --> 01:38:41,874
from prison without "Gaia"?

1029
01:38:58,792 --> 01:39:00,082
Why do you always do this?

1030
01:39:00,083 --> 01:39:01,291
Keeping me in the dark

1031
01:39:01,292 --> 01:39:03,417
can't you give me a heads up

1032
01:39:05,375 --> 01:39:06,666
I promise you

1033
01:39:07,417 --> 01:39:09,082
from now on, whatever I do

1034
01:39:09,083 --> 01:39:10,583
I'll ask you first

1035
01:39:12,458 --> 01:39:13,624
Ms. Li

1036
01:39:13,625 --> 01:39:15,250
may I kiss you?

1037
01:39:33,250 --> 01:39:34,708
Are you out of your mind?

1038
01:39:43,667 --> 01:39:45,375
Women are complicated

1039
01:39:46,250 --> 01:39:47,582
like I said

1040
01:39:47,583 --> 01:39:48,374
plan B

1041
01:39:48,375 --> 01:39:49,833
what is plan B?

1042
01:39:50,750 --> 01:39:53,125
Just play it by ear

1043
01:40:19,792 --> 01:40:22,749
"'gaia' returns home"

1044
01:40:22,750 --> 01:40:25,083
"from an unknown benefactor"

1045
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:37,708
good morning

1046
01:40:37,709 --> 01:40:39,041
you have a package

1047
01:40:39,042 --> 01:40:40,042
thank you

1048
01:41:48,167 --> 01:41:50,458
come on guys! I'm done before you

1049
01:41:52,708 --> 01:41:54,458
we got to give it a shake

1050
01:41:55,083 --> 01:41:56,291
now what?

1051
01:41:57,042 --> 01:41:58,333
Plan C!
