"1997"

3
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,780
Come, do it now

4
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:36,240
doing what?

5
00:02:36,574 --> 00:02:38,742
Put your hand next to me

6
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:56,802
Don't move, otherwise it will draw crooked off

7
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:07,146
Reserved

8
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:08,898
My dad has talked to your dad

9
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:10,482
They will give us a unit

10
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:15,529
But this layer has only one unit

11
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:24,371
He never said that he could not choose the penthouse

12
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:26,957
Ancient confusion

13
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:28,709
But I like it

14
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:30,586
Promise me, after completion

15
00:03:30,628 --> 00:03:31,754
We move together to live

16
00:03:33,339 --> 00:03:34,173
it is good

17
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:39,595
No regret

18
00:03:40,346 --> 00:03:41,347
it is good

19
00:04:41,657 --> 00:04:42,783
Wait

20
00:04:42,992 --> 00:04:45,244
Don't forget to use the ring I gave you

21
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:47,162
So we are like Shuangmei Mark

22
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:49,248
Don't you remember?

23
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:51,583
The mall has a new sticker camera

24
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,336
OK, we see the school tomorrow

25
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,673
My business is over when you do this

26
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,632
What do they say?

27
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:00,092
Banks are going bankrupt

28
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:01,260
collapse?

29
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:04,013
You can't do that

30
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:08,017
All my cash and assets...

31
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,727
What happened?

32
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:26,535
Thailand becomes Asia's economy
The dream of the fifth largest country has come to nothing

33
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:29,163
The government announced the Thai baht exchange rate fluctuations

34
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:32,291
Leading to an unprecedented drop in the Thai economic index

35
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:35,044
Thailand is about to go bankrupt

36
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:38,630
Due to the economic collapse, many companies closed their businesses

37
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:41,675
The government ordered 16 financial institutions to cease operations

38
00:05:41,717 --> 00:05:46,180
At present, the core of Thailand's economy has ceased operation

39
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:50,017
More than three million people are expected to be unemployed this year

40
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,186
Numbers continue to rise

41
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:57,733
The company goes bankrupt, so I have to sell something

42
00:05:58,067 --> 00:05:59,526
Thai baht devaluation

43
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:03,155
From 25 Thai baht to 1 US dollar down to 56 Thai baht

44
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:07,034
Debts of various industries are high and bankrupt overnight

45
00:06:07,076 --> 00:06:08,952
We lost this battle

46
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,120
"Dilapidated households rich market"

47
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:12,873
Directly affected is...

48
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:21,632
The people's life is very difficult

49
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:22,758
Get out!

50
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,844
Without income, the public can only live and work hard

51
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:30,057
The real estate market has frozen nearly 200 billion baht

52
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:33,769
Overhead demand for residential buildings and skyscrapers

53
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:35,771
Nobody wants to buy now

54
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:50,327
"No entry"

55
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,901
My dad is a bad guy

56
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,697
How can he do this to you?

57
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:30,219
Here's what I bought for you

58
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:38,393
Your dad still want to commit suicide?

59
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:42,314
He is so poor

60
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:44,733
What to do will not be successful

61
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:46,735
When he wants to commit suicide

62
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,821
My mom hid the gun so that he could not find it

63
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:54,952
But I know where she hides

64
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,000
and so…

65
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:05,170
Do you want to kill your dad?

66
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,675
No, I can't give up

67
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:13,178
I am still relatively easy to commit suicide

68
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:18,016
Are you stupid?

69
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:21,186
Who are you dead?

70
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:31,863
Our family will be seized next week

71
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:36,535
My mom may take us to somewhere else

72
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:42,457
I'm afraid I can't see you again

73
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:46,920
Don't worry too much

74
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:53,635
Here's for you

75
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,890
This is my tuition

76
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:04,730
Anyway, I don't want to read that rotten school

77
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:10,068
Without you, am I good?

78
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:16,158
You less exaggerated

79
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:22,664
What can I call at any time?

80
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:27,294
don't Cry

81
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:42,267
"Happy birthday to you!"

82
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:49,983
"Now call you Miss."

83
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:53,153
"I hope we
Can go through this difficulty together

84
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:58,700
Thai baht currency has been fluctuating since 1996

85
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:02,996
Stock market investors began to manipulate the market

86
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:05,999
Spread rumors at the same time

87
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,502
Said that the Thai economy is in crisis

88
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,545
Now it is a daytime shower

89
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:12,673
As a result, stock is gradually being shorted

90
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:15,801
Bank of Thailand's stance is firm

91
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:20,097
Don't reduce the Thai baht, in order to defend the Thai baht

92
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,556
Intervene...

93
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:29,690
dad

94
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:44,121
Why don't you talk to Daddy?
Continue to build Sathorn Building?

95
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:45,455
do you know?

96
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:50,168
I went back to stock broking for a few days

97
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:54,297
There is a big passenger to give me money to buy stocks

98
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,467
We will be rich again

99
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:00,679
Really? Dad?

100
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:01,722
Really

101
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,017
Not bad right?

102
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:39,843
"I must move somewhere else."

103
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:43,305
"I may never see you again."

104
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,187
Where did the money go?

105
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,772
What money, Mom?

106
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:55,108
The school called you have not paid tuition

107
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,568
Where did the money go?

108
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,783
I have spent it

109
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:04,868
How can you spend it?

110
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,244
I gave you a lot of money

111
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,371
What did you bought?

112
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:13,668
Mom!

113
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,547
Let go

114
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,389
Do you know how hard it is to make money?

115
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:29,100
Even used to buy this meaningless thing

116
00:13:29,935 --> 00:13:31,812
My daughter will not mess like this

117
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,568
Am I still your daughter?

118
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,030
Did you think of me when making your decision?

119
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:44,324
Help me transfer to school casually

120
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:46,660
Also forced me to go to the streets to help you sell things

121
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:51,456
I will be very shameful when I see my friend

122
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:56,002
If you let me choose

123
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:58,129
I will not want to be born as your daughter

124
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,137
Since you feel shameful

125
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:07,389
Get out

126
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:08,890
Just die to the edge

127
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:24,948
"Dad hit me again"

128
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:27,617
"I can't stand it anymore."

129
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:36,501
Hey?

130
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:38,128
Ok

131
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:39,546
Give you

132
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:40,589
Miss

133
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:41,715
Pay money

134
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,924
I am sorry

135
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:46,219
Scream of Life

Wes Kraven directed

137
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:09,034
You don't have to worry about it

138
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:12,913
Believe me, you will make big money

139
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,959
It's fun to talk to people who understand things

140
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:21,504
Those scholars don't know what to say

141
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:24,883
do you know?

142
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:30,013
Waiting for the market temperature, those scholars are unemployed

143
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,016
So they want to blindly scared

144
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:37,270
But I think...

145
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,106
Currently

146
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:42,067
Those moths that extinguish the fire will die first

147
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:45,779
That's right

148
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,033
Wen

149
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:51,493
How did you come?

150
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:53,286
Only you?

151
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,455
Wait for me, we'll go home together

152
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:58,041
I'll dump with guests first

153
00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,167
Yes

154
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:02,003
That oil group, as I said

155
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:03,880
The most stable array

156
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:07,509
In any case, the government has to subsidize them

157
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:11,388
That's right

158
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:17,310
Right, it is time

159
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:19,396
Trust me

160
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,731
I have inside information

161
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,657
Message Center switchboard, hello

181810

163
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:36,830
It is meaningless to be alive

164
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:38,707
I am going to the building waiting for you

165
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,293
I remember with that velvet bag

166
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,252
Are you afraid?

167
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:37,515
Don't be afraid

168
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:41,686
If you continue to live, how much will be hurt?

169
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,163
Don't let me die alone

170
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:09,714
promise me

171
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:24,104
happy Birthday

172
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:26,916
Don't want to see anything, don't want to see the sky

173
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:32,213
My eyes want to rest forever

174
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:43,766
Other important news

175
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:48,229
Investigate the project of "Man Yi Hao Life" apartment building

176
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,607
"2017"

177
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,568
It has been found that the blueprints have not been constructed according to the design

178
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:57,530
Officials have revoked construction licenses

179
00:19:57,614 --> 00:20:01,201
The following is the chief executive of the contractor development company

180
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:03,953
Interview with Parivian Ryan Vichaya

181
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:07,040
This is the responsibility of the contractor

182
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:09,626
We are about to file a complaint against them

183
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:13,087
If you continue to develop the plan, will be informed

184
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:17,258
"Monday"

185
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,557
Miss Pa, the car arrived

186
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:26,684
Belle and the manager are waiting for you in the car

187
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:28,519
OK, I'll go right away

188
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:37,737
Sathorn Building Construction Project

189
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:44,077
Fortunately, you continue to build this building

190
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,038
Otherwise, our company will be declared bankrupt

191
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:49,290
don't worry

192
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,461
I have also experienced that kind of thing

193
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:56,172
I know how terrible it feels

194
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,926
I will not repeat history

195
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:03,346
Mani project is a pity

196
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,515
We have invested a lot of money

197
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:07,558
Did not expect that kind of thing happen

198
00:22:19,422 --> 00:22:22,300
The structure is 100% safe

199
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:26,471
The structure of the building was completed before the shutdown

200
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:32,018
I am sorry

201
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:35,271
what's up?

202
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:41,944
You can see the building is still very attractive

203
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:46,115
Has been idle for 20 years

204
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:49,452
Because the other half belongs to my dad's partner

205
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:54,248
It's hard to find land right in the city center

206
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:57,835
As long as you are willing to give us a loan, I would like to...

207
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:01,672
Miss Pau, Man Arnold loan you have not paid

208
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:04,509
We are going to file a bankruptcy application for you

209
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:07,970
How could you approve another loan to you?

210
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:12,392
Even if you confiscate all of our assets for resale

211
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:14,394
Not enough full loan

212
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:17,230
And you have to sell it all

213
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:22,151
But if you give me a loan to build this building

214
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,487
We will have enough money

215
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:27,240
Manui and Sathorn are paid two pen counts to the bank

216
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:29,742
This is good for you and me, right?

217
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:34,414
I will give you a week

218
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:36,874
You clarify with your partner

219
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:40,253
We have to make sure that the project will be carried out as scheduled

220
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:43,589
Otherwise, I must file a bankruptcy application for you

221
00:23:45,967 --> 00:23:47,427
Absolutely no problem

222
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,406
Hey

223
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:58,159
I just stroll

224
00:26:58,743 --> 00:27:00,036
I'll drop right away

225
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:01,537
OK, Mom

226
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:05,082
"happy Birthday"

227
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:16,153
Why did you bring it back?

228
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:18,114
Dirty and old

229
00:28:18,698 --> 00:28:21,075
I have never seen a real pager

230
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:22,660
Only seen online

231
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:24,662
You know old stuff

232
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:26,372
Open to it!

233
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:27,498
Scared to death 咩

234
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:28,874
Can also be used

235
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:30,334
Do you have a message? tell me

236
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:30,960
Yes!

237
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:33,045
Rose is red

238
00:28:33,254 --> 00:28:35,297
Violet is blue

239
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:37,717
please tell me…

240
00:28:38,134 --> 00:28:40,219
Point solution I will hang you?

241
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,513
Very old fashioned

242
00:28:42,513 --> 00:28:43,973
and also…

243
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:46,976
1,2,3, shark live

244
00:28:47,101 --> 00:28:49,270
4, 5, 6, lizard bulge Bu

245
00:28:49,979 --> 00:28:51,897
7, 8, 9, friendship is long and long

246
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:55,192
10, hanging you hung to the eyes wet

247
00:28:57,528 --> 00:29:00,823
Writing is good, but using the map is much simpler

248
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:01,866
Right

249
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:05,786
In those days they wanted to say such things to strangers

250
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:07,455
Will not be awkward?

251
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:13,836
what happened?

252
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:19,675
Don't want to see anything, don't want to see the sky

253
00:29:20,718 --> 00:29:23,387
My eyes want to rest forever

254
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:27,975
Hide in the shadow of the moon

255
00:29:29,185 --> 00:29:31,437
Just want to dream, no longer awake

256
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,400
I feel really sad

257
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:39,779
As if heard

258
00:29:39,862 --> 00:29:42,490
Should be the lyrics come

259
00:29:43,616 --> 00:29:44,408
wait for me

260
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:48,120
found it

261
00:29:48,788 --> 00:29:50,039
Passed to you

262
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:54,293
This is the link

263
00:29:54,335 --> 00:29:55,127
it is good

264
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:04,970
Don't want to see anything, don't want to see the sky

265
00:30:05,095 --> 00:30:10,142
My eyes want to rest forever

266
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:15,147
Peach

267
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:17,566
Last message

268
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,361
It is meaningless to be alive

269
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:22,071
I am going to the building waiting for you

270
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:25,616
I remember with that velvet bag

271
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:35,084
Do you think the same as I thought?

272
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:47,221
It may be nothing

273
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:49,765
Maybe just a joke

274
00:30:50,391 --> 00:30:51,100
Oh shit!

275
00:30:53,936 --> 00:30:55,229
Scared you!

276
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:57,731
Are you scared? I am sorry

277
00:30:57,731 --> 00:30:59,567
Don't open this joke

278
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:01,735
Tin back to you

279
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:02,903
Okay

280
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,352
Is it you, Belle?

281
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:32,344
Belle?

282
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:28,984
You want to point?

283
00:34:30,611 --> 00:34:31,862
I have the alarm

284
00:34:57,346 --> 00:34:58,055
Belle

285
00:34:58,514 --> 00:34:59,431
Someone broke in

286
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:00,891
Call the police

287
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:02,059
Faster!

288
00:35:06,647 --> 00:35:07,940
How many people live here?

289
00:35:08,482 --> 00:35:09,274
Two

290
00:35:11,777 --> 00:35:13,529
My husband passed away long ago

291
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:20,327
We did not find anyone searching everywhere

292
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:22,538
I went to see the fire escape

293
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:24,706
Wait for me here

294
00:35:25,249 --> 00:35:26,333
Okay, police officer

295
00:35:34,258 --> 00:35:35,634
What are you looking for?

296
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:36,969
My cell phone

297
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:38,345
It must be in the room

298
00:35:38,554 --> 00:35:39,680
I'll look for it

299
00:35:39,847 --> 00:35:40,931
Wait for me to get it

300
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:05,664
Sorry, my wife

301
00:36:06,165 --> 00:36:07,082
what's up?

302
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:10,335
How long was the handprint on the wall?

303
00:36:37,571 --> 00:36:40,324
When the maid's gone, I locked the door

304
00:36:40,449 --> 00:36:42,409
No one came in again later

305
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:43,577
Try fast turn

306
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:51,543
What is the problem? Press play

307
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:11,498
"Tuesday"

308
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:15,127
I thought Belle was no longer sleepy after age five

309
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:18,005
This is her first time sleepwalking again?

310
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:18,714
Yes, doctor

311
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:19,923
you sure?

312
00:38:20,007 --> 00:38:23,927
Sometimes the patient will sleepwalking for many years

313
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:26,805
But don't know their sleepwalking

314
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:28,724
Because they are sleeping alone

315
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:32,978
Doctors…

316
00:38:33,854 --> 00:38:37,107
Why did Belle begin to draw while dreaming?

317
00:38:37,733 --> 00:38:38,650
in fact…

318
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:40,652
When the patient is sleepwalking

319
00:38:41,028 --> 00:38:42,404
No matter the way

320
00:38:42,738 --> 00:38:44,781
It is good to see or do anything

321
00:38:45,532 --> 00:38:50,162
They are all done according to subconscious instructions

322
00:39:04,468 --> 00:39:07,012
For example, her current symptoms

323
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:11,224
Is caused by the imbalance of neurotransmitters

324
00:39:11,892 --> 00:39:13,185
Does she need to be hospitalized again?

325
00:39:13,352 --> 00:39:14,186
Not necessary

326
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:16,605
I will prescribe medicine to improve her condition

327
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:17,606
Re-open sleeping pills

328
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:19,066
If she is still sleepwalking

329
00:39:19,149 --> 00:39:20,692
Don't wake her up immediately

330
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:22,361
Please take her picture

331
00:39:22,444 --> 00:39:24,071
We can use to analyze symptoms

332
00:39:25,572 --> 00:39:26,239
it is good

333
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:35,749
# Sick # sleep a lot # declined visit

334
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:01,858
I heard you want to come, I'll pick up something instrument

335
00:40:02,776 --> 00:40:05,445
This should be done to send you

336
00:40:12,452 --> 00:40:14,413
When I see you reminds me of the instrument

337
00:40:14,496 --> 00:40:17,416
I don't know what she is alive

338
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:19,292
What will I do now?

339
00:40:19,376 --> 00:40:20,544
Enough, Mom

340
00:40:20,961 --> 00:40:23,004
The instrument has been dead for 20 years

341
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:25,132
She may have been reborn

342
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:29,261
Into the wealthy daughter, lived comfortably

343
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:31,179
More comfortable than me

344
00:40:31,638 --> 00:40:33,682
Mom, only you can't let go

345
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:37,519
As for this contract...

346
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:38,562
It's okay

347
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:42,107
But the number can't

348
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:47,446
Now the land in this area has risen a lot

349
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:49,322
Probably tenfold

350
00:40:51,158 --> 00:40:53,743
Have you seen the status of that building?

351
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:57,372
Construction spending and devaluation must be counted

352
00:40:58,373 --> 00:40:59,499
You know it too

353
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:03,086
Our dad only finished 60% of the project

354
00:41:04,337 --> 00:41:06,756
I try to give you the highest amount

355
00:41:07,174 --> 00:41:09,092
Since it is so troublesome, don't get up again

356
00:41:09,301 --> 00:41:10,510
Trouble is dead, too hard to do

357
00:41:12,554 --> 00:41:13,305
Ao

358
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,140
Don't be excited

359
00:41:16,266 --> 00:41:17,809
Wen is like family

360
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:19,936
Price can't be higher anymore

361
00:41:21,188 --> 00:41:22,689
But if you want more

362
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,817
I can give you 10% of the profits

363
00:41:30,197 --> 00:41:31,907
Profit dividend?

364
00:41:32,324 --> 00:41:34,075
What if you don't make money?

365
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:35,994
I can't get the slightest bit

366
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:36,745
Right?

367
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:39,206
How do I know if you will keep your promise?

368
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:44,085
You know I can't understand the number of discs

369
00:41:50,175 --> 00:41:51,343
Then you are free

370
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,762
and many more

371
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:59,392
Well, I am out of respect for our father

372
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:02,187
Not like this

373
00:42:03,605 --> 00:42:07,817
If you can give me your bonus as you said

374
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:10,195
Then deal it

375
00:42:11,488 --> 00:42:12,948
This contract is good enough

376
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:14,908
The price can be negotiated

377
00:42:26,795 --> 00:42:28,380
Belle took sleeping pills

378
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:30,924
9:00 to go to bed

379
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:33,051
So far no sleepwalking

380
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:52,571
If you are hungry, there is a salad in the fridge

381
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:56,241
I will ask you to go later than usual

382
00:42:56,658 --> 00:42:59,035
Until I'm sure Belle no longer sleepwalking

383
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:06,960
Problems?

384
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,255
I saw a piece of Belle's sleepwalking

385
00:43:10,964 --> 00:43:13,341
Do you think she is just sleepwalking?

386
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:14,467
of course

387
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:18,847
Yes, ma'am

388
00:43:48,335 --> 00:43:51,796
Wen and instrument

389
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:55,383
"happy Birthday"

390
00:45:32,981 --> 00:45:34,399
Are you coming alone?

391
00:45:43,491 --> 00:45:44,617
come in

392
00:46:24,365 --> 00:46:25,533
me too

393
00:46:28,453 --> 00:46:29,412
really?

394
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:32,874
where is it?

395
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:37,837
How long have you been there?

396
00:46:40,048 --> 00:46:41,549
Beautiful scenery

397
00:46:45,345 --> 00:46:46,971
Are you lonely?

398
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:39,899
How long have you known with my mom?

399
00:48:01,337 --> 00:48:02,463
What do you stand there?

400
00:48:37,332 --> 00:48:44,923
Don't want to see anything, don't want to see the sky

401
00:48:45,214 --> 00:48:51,179
My eyes want to rest forever

402
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:56,768
Belle!

403
00:49:05,818 --> 00:49:08,988
"Wednesday"

404
00:49:10,156 --> 00:49:11,616
Did I sleep around last night?

405
00:49:14,243 --> 00:49:15,495
Have you recorded it?

406
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:20,041
No

407
00:49:20,541 --> 00:49:22,543
You don't sleep long time

408
00:49:22,752 --> 00:49:23,753
Ugh…

409
00:49:23,836 --> 00:49:26,673
The doctor said sleepwalking symptoms will eventually disappear

410
00:49:28,591 --> 00:49:32,762
I have obediently take medicine, how will still sleepwalking?

411
00:49:35,223 --> 00:49:36,057
mom

412
00:49:36,516 --> 00:49:38,977
I want to cancel Saturday's birthday party

413
00:49:40,061 --> 00:49:42,897
I kind of only a panda 咁, video will be ugly

414
00:49:45,692 --> 00:49:46,526
Ok

415
00:49:47,402 --> 00:49:49,696
Wait for you to fill it up again

416
00:49:50,863 --> 00:49:52,532
Want me to send you a birthday present?

417
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:54,617
Alright

418
00:49:54,617 --> 00:49:56,577
My phone is broken

419
00:49:57,495 --> 00:49:59,747
Can I send my new cell phone as a birthday present?

420
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:03,793
Try it if you don't believe it

421
00:50:04,043 --> 00:50:06,796
Lights will always flash when the ring

422
00:50:07,213 --> 00:50:07,964
look

423
00:50:08,715 --> 00:50:09,674
like this

424
00:50:12,677 --> 00:50:13,845
Thank you

425
00:51:16,324 --> 00:51:17,366
instrument…

426
00:51:19,786 --> 00:51:22,246
I'm sorry for leaving you that day

427
00:51:24,373 --> 00:51:26,584
I did not come back to see you later

428
00:51:30,296 --> 00:51:31,839
From now on…

429
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:34,842
I will do more good deeds and often pray for you

430
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:39,722
but…

431
00:51:43,392 --> 00:51:45,103
Can you please put my daughter?

432
00:52:08,251 --> 00:52:11,129
1,2,3, shark live

433
00:52:11,754 --> 00:52:14,799
4, 5, 6, lizard bulge Bu

434
00:52:15,258 --> 00:52:18,302
7, 8, 9, friendship is long and long

435
00:52:18,845 --> 00:52:22,014
10, hanging you hung to the eyes wet

436
00:52:25,518 --> 00:52:26,686
What's wrong, Amon?

437
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,317
Wait!

438
00:52:39,407 --> 00:52:40,116
and many more!

439
00:52:41,701 --> 00:52:42,493
what happened?

440
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:44,370
Why do you run away?

441
00:52:45,204 --> 00:52:46,789
I ask you, what did you see?

442
00:52:49,876 --> 00:52:51,878
She is behind you

443
00:52:55,798 --> 00:52:56,465
Who?

444
00:52:57,675 --> 00:52:58,217
who is it?

445
00:52:58,467 --> 00:52:59,552
Who are you talking about?

446
00:52:59,635 --> 00:53:00,720
I ask you, who are you talking about?

447
00:53:01,012 --> 00:53:01,554
answer me!

448
00:53:01,637 --> 00:53:02,263
What do you mean?

449
00:53:02,555 --> 00:53:03,181
Who?

450
00:53:03,264 --> 00:53:04,307
Sorry

451
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:06,642
The child into a messing story

452
00:53:06,726 --> 00:53:08,936
Please ignore him

453
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:08,955
Belle

454
00:54:11,916 --> 00:54:13,459
What are you looking for?

455
00:54:15,544 --> 00:54:16,504
Belle?

456
00:54:18,631 --> 00:54:19,966
big scissors

457
00:54:20,716 --> 00:54:22,134
Right there

458
00:54:23,094 --> 00:54:24,637
your mom

459
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,973
I asked the scissors to close

460
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:29,392
It's all here

461
00:54:35,856 --> 00:54:37,650
Belle, you scared me

462
00:54:37,817 --> 00:54:38,651
Give you

463
00:54:39,652 --> 00:54:42,280
You run out and ask you to put the scissors back

464
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,615
I am going to go to the market

465
00:55:47,553 --> 00:55:48,429
it is good

466
00:55:48,846 --> 00:55:49,930
I am up now

467
00:55:50,765 --> 00:55:51,807
Is Belle still awake?

468
00:55:52,933 --> 00:55:55,019
Go to the market and go quickly

469
00:56:39,063 --> 00:56:40,398
"Alive is meaningless..."

470
00:56:52,827 --> 00:56:54,078
"Alive is meaningless, I am going to the building waiting for you."

471
00:57:05,297 --> 00:57:07,758
Miss Pa, you have a registered letter

472
00:57:39,874 --> 00:57:40,541
Belle?

473
00:57:41,167 --> 00:57:41,834
Belle!

474
00:57:44,086 --> 00:57:45,421
Belle!

475
00:57:46,464 --> 00:57:47,506
What happened?

476
00:57:47,882 --> 00:57:49,175
Are you OK?

477
00:57:50,926 --> 00:57:52,511
Inhale, take a deep breath

478
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:56,932
mom…

479
00:57:59,935 --> 00:58:01,228
Where did you get it from?

480
00:58:01,812 --> 00:58:03,147
I obviously have thrown away

481
00:58:11,655 --> 00:58:13,616
I remember that…

482
00:58:16,202 --> 00:58:18,037
At that time I was almost 15 years old

483
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:22,583
That is our impulsive decision

484
00:58:24,001 --> 00:58:25,836
We want to commit suicide together

485
00:58:26,545 --> 00:58:28,172
So that everything can end

486
00:58:32,801 --> 00:58:34,345
But after the instrument committed suicide

487
00:58:36,555 --> 00:58:37,640
I'm scared

488
00:58:40,684 --> 00:58:42,144
She left her like this

489
00:58:44,063 --> 00:58:46,232
I did not tell anyone about it

490
00:58:46,982 --> 00:58:48,150
Did not even tell her mother

491
00:58:57,743 --> 00:58:58,577
mom…

492
00:59:00,788 --> 00:59:01,830
This Saturday

493
00:59:02,331 --> 00:59:03,999
I am about 15 years old

494
00:59:07,753 --> 00:59:09,630
As old as you were then

495
00:59:11,298 --> 00:59:12,216
Belle

496
00:59:13,842 --> 00:59:15,636
This matter has nothing to do with you

497
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:16,762
Belle

498
00:59:17,012 --> 00:59:18,097
look at me

499
00:59:18,305 --> 00:59:19,306
Hear me out

500
00:59:19,598 --> 00:59:21,183
You can't do anything

501
00:59:22,768 --> 00:59:23,769
I am here

502
00:59:24,603 --> 00:59:25,771
Belle, look at me

503
00:59:26,355 --> 00:59:27,815
Mom, I'm so scared

504
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:29,275
Calm down

505
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,943
Can I stay with you?

506
00:59:31,026 --> 00:59:32,695
Don't mess around

507
00:59:33,112 --> 00:59:33,862
Belle

508
00:59:34,321 --> 00:59:36,198
Mom, I really die?

509
00:59:36,824 --> 00:59:39,535
I will not let anyone hurt you

510
00:59:39,827 --> 00:59:41,453
Please help me

511
01:00:03,058 --> 01:00:04,101
Hurts?

512
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:06,729
do you know?

513
01:00:07,229 --> 01:00:09,315
I'm actually good for you

514
01:00:10,065 --> 01:00:12,026
I caught in this dilemma

515
01:00:13,694 --> 01:00:16,030
Although all this has nothing to do with me

516
01:00:19,617 --> 01:00:21,410
But I think back

517
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:27,249
You are not suicide right

518
01:00:35,799 --> 01:00:36,467
mom

519
01:00:37,343 --> 01:00:38,719
Can you promise me?

520
01:00:39,803 --> 01:00:42,222
From now on no matter what happens

521
01:00:42,514 --> 01:00:44,224
You can't give up life

522
01:00:44,892 --> 01:00:47,269
Don't have the idea of suicide

523
01:00:51,774 --> 01:00:52,441
it is good

524
01:00:54,777 --> 01:00:55,653
I promise you

525
01:00:57,738 --> 01:01:00,407
Adults are shaking hands

526
01:01:59,216 --> 01:01:59,883
Belle

527
01:02:01,385 --> 01:02:02,094
Belle...

528
01:02:08,267 --> 01:02:08,976
Belle...

529
01:02:09,435 --> 01:02:10,519
Why do you do this?

530
01:02:12,563 --> 01:02:13,731
I really want to sleep

531
01:02:19,945 --> 01:02:20,946
Nothing, good girl

532
01:02:21,655 --> 01:02:22,614
Go to sleep

533
01:02:22,698 --> 01:02:23,574
I will accompany you

534
01:02:27,703 --> 01:02:28,454
Belle

535
01:02:29,788 --> 01:02:30,539
Belle

536
01:02:32,332 --> 01:02:37,212
"Thursday"

537
01:02:37,629 --> 01:02:39,840
The doctor helped her inject the medicine

538
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:42,259
Let her rest will be better

539
01:02:44,928 --> 01:02:46,138
no matter what happens

540
01:02:46,847 --> 01:02:48,849
Don't let her leave your sight

541
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:50,893
If you want to go or do other things

542
01:02:50,976 --> 01:02:52,436
You have to find someone to replace you

543
01:02:53,604 --> 01:02:54,938
If she woke up

544
01:02:55,147 --> 01:02:55,939
Call me right away

545
01:02:56,023 --> 01:02:57,316
rest assured

546
01:02:57,357 --> 01:02:58,942
We gave her sleeping pills

547
01:02:58,984 --> 01:03:00,486
She will wake up long after she sleeps

548
01:03:00,527 --> 01:03:01,987
If you don't understand me

549
01:03:02,404 --> 01:03:03,947
I'll look for someone to take care of her

550
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:08,619
understood

551
01:03:16,668 --> 01:03:18,253
I'll be back soon

552
01:03:30,891 --> 01:03:32,392
What did you tell me yesterday?

553
01:03:34,102 --> 01:03:36,021
Do you really see her?

554
01:03:40,943 --> 01:03:43,445
What does she look like?

555
01:03:43,612 --> 01:03:44,655
I am also not certain

556
01:03:45,364 --> 01:03:46,615
I am scared to see

557
01:03:47,282 --> 01:03:48,575
Only saw one

558
01:03:48,742 --> 01:03:50,035
Girl wearing a red dress

559
01:03:52,913 --> 01:03:54,414
Can you take me to find her?

560
01:03:56,834 --> 01:03:58,418
Please let him go

561
01:04:03,549 --> 01:04:04,883
I beg you!

562
01:04:05,509 --> 01:04:06,718
As long as he helps me

563
01:04:07,511 --> 01:04:08,929
I am willing to give you a reward

564
01:04:09,596 --> 01:04:11,348
Not a question of money

565
01:04:11,723 --> 01:04:13,642
I'm worried he will be short and long

566
01:04:13,725 --> 01:04:16,436
Please don't force him to do it

567
01:04:16,562 --> 01:04:17,813
Please, my wife

568
01:04:24,486 --> 01:04:26,363
How many people in their home work here?

569
01:04:28,282 --> 01:04:29,241
8 people

570
01:04:33,078 --> 01:04:34,371
All will be expelled tomorrow

571
01:04:35,622 --> 01:04:36,498
Miss Pal

572
01:04:38,333 --> 01:04:39,585
Please calm down

573
01:04:40,669 --> 01:04:41,962
Think twice

574
01:04:43,755 --> 01:04:45,173
please

575
01:04:45,257 --> 01:04:48,343
Please don't fire us, we have nowhere to go

576
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:49,636
it is good

577
01:04:55,517 --> 01:04:56,810
I'll take you

578
01:05:02,983 --> 01:05:03,692
what!

579
01:05:08,405 --> 01:05:09,489
Are you hurt?

580
01:05:11,783 --> 01:05:15,579
I'm not really going to fire your family

581
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:18,206
But I really have no choice

582
01:05:18,707 --> 01:05:20,959
She is coming to claim my daughter

583
01:05:21,835 --> 01:05:23,462
Please help me this favor

584
01:05:51,782 --> 01:05:53,033
what happened?

585
01:06:13,345 --> 01:06:14,930
Nothing, Amon

586
01:06:36,994 --> 01:06:37,911
who is it?

587
01:06:41,748 --> 01:06:42,541
Natty

588
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:44,835
There are workers in the building site?

589
01:06:45,794 --> 01:06:46,712
No

590
01:06:47,129 --> 01:06:49,256
As your bidding evacuated everyone

591
01:06:53,927 --> 01:06:54,594
instrument

592
01:06:55,012 --> 01:06:56,096
is it you?

593
01:07:03,270 --> 01:07:04,396
where are you?

594
01:07:35,761 --> 01:07:36,595
instrument

595
01:07:37,387 --> 01:07:38,680
Kind of come out

596
01:08:27,687 --> 01:08:28,438
Amon, wait!

597
01:08:28,647 --> 01:08:29,481
don't go!

598
01:08:29,815 --> 01:08:31,399
Help me pass it to her

599
01:08:32,317 --> 01:08:33,110
please

600
01:08:43,286 --> 01:08:43,995
instrument

601
01:08:46,164 --> 01:08:47,124
is it you?

602
01:08:51,419 --> 01:08:52,546
Is it instrument?

603
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:16,153
instrument…

604
01:09:19,156 --> 01:09:20,991
Can you put my daughter?

605
01:09:22,242 --> 01:09:24,411
Can you let her daughter?

606
01:09:37,215 --> 01:09:38,383
I beg you, instrument

607
01:09:39,509 --> 01:09:41,303
This thing has nothing to do with Belle

608
01:09:42,345 --> 01:09:43,555
Please stop pestering her again

609
01:09:44,639 --> 01:09:47,184
Do you want to give life to her daughter?

610
01:09:54,149 --> 01:09:55,483
Injustice, debt owners

611
01:09:55,942 --> 01:09:56,943
I'm sorry to you

612
01:09:56,985 --> 01:09:58,987
If you want revenge, find me

613
01:10:08,163 --> 01:10:09,039
Where has she been?

614
01:10:09,831 --> 01:10:10,874
where is she?

615
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:12,667
I don't know

616
01:10:21,134 --> 01:10:21,801
Amon

617
01:10:23,136 --> 01:10:23,803
Amon!

618
01:10:24,971 --> 01:10:25,764
Are you OK?

619
01:10:30,268 --> 01:10:30,810
Let go!

620
01:10:30,852 --> 01:10:32,562
I'm going, I am so scared!

621
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:34,356
Amon

622
01:10:34,898 --> 01:10:35,565
Amon!

623
01:10:36,233 --> 01:10:36,900
Amon!

624
01:10:43,365 --> 01:10:44,157
Amon, it's me

625
01:10:44,199 --> 01:10:45,575
let me go!

626
01:10:45,617 --> 01:10:46,534
Amon, it's me

627
01:10:46,576 --> 01:10:48,078
Amon!

628
01:10:48,370 --> 01:10:49,246
it's me

629
01:10:49,537 --> 01:10:50,538
I can't do it…

630
01:10:50,914 --> 01:10:52,582
Can not help you anymore

631
01:10:52,624 --> 01:10:53,458
Of course you can

632
01:10:53,875 --> 01:10:55,585
Please help me, I beg you

633
01:10:55,752 --> 01:10:56,378
please

634
01:10:56,419 --> 01:10:58,255
Your daughter is going to die anyway

635
01:10:59,381 --> 01:11:00,215
Don't!

636
01:11:00,715 --> 01:11:02,133
My daughter can't die!

637
01:11:02,801 --> 01:11:04,094
My daughter will not die!

638
01:11:19,734 --> 01:11:20,527
Amon

639
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:21,695
What do you see, Amon?

640
01:11:22,696 --> 01:11:23,363
Amon

641
01:11:23,738 --> 01:11:24,698
What's wrong, Amon?

642
01:11:30,245 --> 01:11:31,037
enough!

643
01:11:31,121 --> 01:11:32,872
I am so scared, I don't want to help you again

644
01:11:33,164 --> 01:11:34,666
Mom saves me!

645
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:35,959
So scary!

646
01:11:36,042 --> 01:11:37,294
Nothing to be scared of

647
01:11:37,502 --> 01:11:39,462
Amon, calm down

648
01:11:39,546 --> 01:11:40,255
Amon...

649
01:11:40,297 --> 01:11:41,506
All right

650
01:11:41,548 --> 01:11:42,257
Amon

651
01:11:42,299 --> 01:11:44,759
Calm down, don't be afraid

652
01:11:45,719 --> 01:11:47,470
I'll take you back to find your mother

653
01:11:47,554 --> 01:11:49,097
Don't be afraid

654
01:11:49,222 --> 01:11:50,098
Nothing will happen

655
01:12:01,484 --> 01:12:03,028
I am sorry

656
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:15,248
"Friday"

657
01:12:15,332 --> 01:12:16,041
Wen

658
01:12:17,334 --> 01:12:18,626
What's wrong?

659
01:12:20,879 --> 01:12:21,671
aunt

660
01:12:22,839 --> 01:12:24,841
Can I talk to you?

661
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,761
Miss Pa, what's the problem?

662
01:12:29,054 --> 01:12:30,221
This is a private matter

663
01:12:34,642 --> 01:12:35,935
I think we should...

664
01:12:37,145 --> 01:12:39,272
I have something important to tell you

665
01:12:53,495 --> 01:12:55,288
You have something to say to my mom, I should also be there

666
01:13:05,632 --> 01:13:06,508
aunt…

667
01:13:08,927 --> 01:13:10,178
I am sorry

668
01:13:15,767 --> 01:13:16,476
Wen...

669
01:13:17,644 --> 01:13:18,686
what's up?

670
01:13:19,813 --> 01:13:21,147
tell me

671
01:13:24,567 --> 01:13:25,485
That day…

672
01:13:29,447 --> 01:13:30,573
Instrument suicide...

673
01:13:35,745 --> 01:13:37,705
I asked her out

674
01:13:39,833 --> 01:13:42,085
We made an appointment to commit suicide

675
01:13:43,461 --> 01:13:44,963
But I am scared

676
01:13:45,130 --> 01:13:46,840
I ran away

677
01:13:47,465 --> 01:13:49,092
How do you tell us now?

678
01:13:49,175 --> 01:13:51,136
After 20 years

679
01:14:00,562 --> 01:14:01,563
just now…

680
01:14:03,022 --> 01:14:04,774
Instrument came back to fulfill my promise

681
01:14:07,819 --> 01:14:10,530
My daughter is 15 tomorrow

682
01:14:13,825 --> 01:14:15,493
She wants to fill my daughter's life

683
01:14:16,744 --> 01:14:17,370
aunt…

684
01:14:19,164 --> 01:14:21,124
Please help me please?

685
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:22,750
I beg you

686
01:14:23,501 --> 01:14:26,880
You want to help me

687
01:14:27,547 --> 01:14:31,342
You can 嬲 me or hate me

688
01:14:31,759 --> 01:14:33,887
But please help me, I beg you

689
01:14:33,928 --> 01:14:35,889
Please look for instrument to talk please?

690
01:14:35,972 --> 01:14:37,765
enough!

691
01:14:37,974 --> 01:14:38,850
enough!

692
01:14:38,933 --> 01:14:39,726
Let go!

693
01:14:42,020 --> 01:14:43,313
Mom, let's go home

694
01:14:49,736 --> 01:14:50,987
Wait, wait a minute

695
01:14:51,279 --> 01:14:52,322
What happened to the contract?

696
01:14:52,363 --> 01:14:53,114
Cancel it

697
01:14:53,573 --> 01:14:55,283
The reason to ask your boss

698
01:14:55,575 --> 01:14:56,201
Go away!

699
01:14:56,242 --> 01:14:56,784
and many more

700
01:14:56,826 --> 01:14:57,744
I told you to go away

701
01:14:57,785 --> 01:14:58,369
Speak slowly

702
01:14:58,411 --> 01:14:59,537
Mom, let's go

703
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:07,962
Miss Pal

704
01:15:08,046 --> 01:15:09,339
Belle disappeared

705
01:15:09,422 --> 01:15:10,298
Missing?

706
01:15:11,591 --> 01:15:12,383
how come?

707
01:15:12,759 --> 01:15:16,596
She locked me up and escaped from the hospital

708
01:15:16,721 --> 01:15:18,223
what? say it again

709
01:15:18,556 --> 01:15:21,976
She locked me up and ran away

710
01:15:22,936 --> 01:15:24,562
I'll be right there

711
01:15:24,729 --> 01:15:26,606
Immediately notify me when I find her

712
01:15:26,773 --> 01:15:28,024
Ok

713
01:15:35,114 --> 01:15:36,658
Mom, save me

714
01:15:37,325 --> 01:15:39,369
I don't know where I am when I wake up

715
01:15:39,577 --> 01:15:41,412
It is not a hospital here

716
01:15:42,830 --> 01:15:43,540
Belle

717
01:15:44,207 --> 01:15:45,250
calm down

718
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:46,876
Say it slowly

719
01:15:48,461 --> 01:15:50,004
Where are you?

720
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,215
don't know

721
01:15:53,716 --> 01:15:55,718
This is a dark room

722
01:15:55,969 --> 01:15:57,637
Look around you

723
01:15:57,845 --> 01:15:58,805
what did you see?

724
01:15:59,305 --> 01:16:00,098
Belle

725
01:16:00,181 --> 01:16:02,016
Old things are everywhere

726
01:16:02,267 --> 01:16:04,352
Grandpa and grandmother photos

727
01:16:04,435 --> 01:16:06,437
And your childhood photo with them

728
01:16:24,622 --> 01:16:25,415
Belle?

729
01:16:33,089 --> 01:16:34,424
"Parvijan Ryan Vichaya"

730
01:16:34,507 --> 01:16:35,466
mom…

731
01:18:21,531 --> 01:18:22,782
"Thank you, Miss Palin."

732
01:18:22,824 --> 01:18:25,493
"I've been taking care of me since I was a kid."

733
01:18:25,576 --> 01:18:26,786
I wish you peace and health

734
01:18:26,828 --> 01:18:29,163
"Please stay with me until I get married."

735
01:18:29,205 --> 01:18:30,206
"Love your Belle"

736
01:18:59,235 --> 01:19:00,236
mom

737
01:19:00,903 --> 01:19:01,863
I want to pee

738
01:19:08,953 --> 01:19:09,954
Will it hurt?

739
01:19:10,246 --> 01:19:11,789
Will it be too tight?

740
01:19:15,710 --> 01:19:16,377
Belle

741
01:19:19,756 --> 01:19:20,381
Belle!

742
01:19:30,725 --> 01:19:31,434
Belle

743
01:19:31,642 --> 01:19:32,268
stop

744
01:19:32,310 --> 01:19:32,977
Belle

745
01:19:33,019 --> 01:19:33,686
I told you to stop

746
01:19:33,770 --> 01:19:34,353
Belle

747
01:19:35,104 --> 01:19:35,688
Stop!

748
01:19:40,568 --> 01:19:41,235
Belle

749
01:19:41,861 --> 01:19:42,445
Belle

750
01:19:42,445 --> 01:19:43,112
Please stop!

751
01:19:43,529 --> 01:19:44,197
Belle

752
01:20:02,215 --> 01:20:02,965
You're back?

753
01:20:07,470 --> 01:20:08,513
Please enter

754
01:20:34,497 --> 01:20:35,540
No, Belle!

755
01:20:35,915 --> 01:20:36,874
No!

756
01:20:37,333 --> 01:20:38,251
I want to go with you

757
01:20:39,210 --> 01:20:39,877
Wait for me

758
01:20:39,919 --> 01:20:40,920
Belle, no

759
01:20:41,796 --> 01:20:43,756
Instrument, don't haunt my daughter again

760
01:20:43,798 --> 01:20:44,799
Let her go!

761
01:20:44,882 --> 01:20:46,592
Please, I beg you

762
01:20:46,676 --> 01:20:48,636
Instrument, don't take her away

763
01:20:49,595 --> 01:20:51,806
1,2,3, shark live

764
01:20:51,889 --> 01:20:54,058
4, 5, 6, lizard bulge Bu

765
01:20:54,141 --> 01:20:56,269
7, 8, 9, friendship is long and long

766
01:20:56,352 --> 01:20:58,521
10, hanging you hung to the eyes wet

767
01:20:58,604 --> 01:21:00,982
1,2,3, shark live

768
01:21:01,232 --> 01:21:03,734
4, 5, 6, lizard bulge Bu

769
01:21:03,818 --> 01:21:06,153
7, 8, 9, friendship is long and long

770
01:21:06,237 --> 01:21:08,614
10, hanging you hung up to your eyes wet

771
01:21:08,906 --> 01:21:11,325
1,2,3, shark live

772
01:21:11,409 --> 01:21:13,619
4, 5, 6, lizard bulge Bu

773
01:21:20,042 --> 01:21:20,751
Please stop

774
01:21:20,835 --> 01:21:21,919
Let go!

775
01:21:22,420 --> 01:21:23,379
I told you to let go!

776
01:21:23,671 --> 01:21:24,714
No, Belle

777
01:21:24,755 --> 01:21:27,174
If I die, it is you harm

778
01:21:27,216 --> 01:21:28,009
Don't move

779
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:28,968
It's your fault!

780
01:21:29,010 --> 01:21:30,469
stop! I told you to let go of me!

781
01:21:30,553 --> 01:21:31,596
I call you stop!

782
01:21:31,721 --> 01:21:32,305
let me go!

783
01:21:32,346 --> 01:21:34,390
Quiet!

784
01:21:37,184 --> 01:21:38,519
I am sorry

785
01:21:56,203 --> 01:21:57,079
mom

786
01:21:58,539 --> 01:21:59,707
Don't you sleep?

787
01:22:13,721 --> 01:22:14,555
mom

788
01:22:15,139 --> 01:22:16,307
what happened?

789
01:22:17,350 --> 01:22:18,684
Please relax for me

790
01:22:25,650 --> 01:22:26,400
mom

791
01:22:27,902 --> 01:22:28,778
I am Belle ah

792
01:22:44,418 --> 01:22:46,504
Aunt Zhu came soon

793
01:22:48,381 --> 01:22:49,924
Nothing to be scared of

794
01:23:00,601 --> 01:23:01,519
mom…

795
01:23:02,436 --> 01:23:03,229
mom

796
01:23:04,188 --> 01:23:05,898
I beg you to come back

797
01:23:50,609 --> 01:23:51,861
Enough, instrument

798
01:23:55,364 --> 01:23:57,366
In the face of father bankruptcy

799
01:23:59,869 --> 01:24:02,872
Remember how angry we are?

800
01:24:04,331 --> 01:24:06,667
Although we are powerless

801
01:24:08,419 --> 01:24:09,962
Don't you remember?

802
01:24:13,382 --> 01:24:16,260
Why do you hurt my daughter?

803
01:24:16,469 --> 01:24:17,636
mom!

804
01:24:19,805 --> 01:24:21,932
Those who have not kept their promise are me

805
01:24:22,516 --> 01:24:24,560
You should come to me

806
01:24:28,064 --> 01:24:31,108
"Belle, don't forget how much I love you / mom."

807
01:24:34,487 --> 01:24:36,864
Mom, don't leave me

808
01:24:54,507 --> 01:24:55,424
hateful!

809
01:24:58,928 --> 01:25:00,346
I want to fulfill our promise

810
01:25:00,429 --> 01:25:01,806
What do you want?

811
01:25:02,389 --> 01:25:04,016
Although everything is my beginning

812
01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:06,227
But who is not you want to die?

813
01:25:20,908 --> 01:25:22,409
Is this really what you want?

814
01:25:24,286 --> 01:25:24,829
Ok

815
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:41,637
Wen, don't shoot

816
01:25:43,139 --> 01:25:44,932
Wen

817
01:25:45,307 --> 01:25:46,392
Please don't hurt me

818
01:25:46,934 --> 01:25:47,601
instrument…

819
01:25:48,686 --> 01:25:50,396
Do you really want me to die?

820
01:25:50,604 --> 01:25:52,565
Then I'll send your mom to funeral

821
01:25:52,940 --> 01:25:54,191
This matter has nothing to do with my mom

822
01:25:54,441 --> 01:25:55,401
The meter is dead

823
01:25:55,484 --> 01:25:56,318
Correct

824
01:25:56,402 --> 01:25:58,612
You died a long time!

825
01:25:58,779 --> 01:26:01,198
Don't haunt my daughter!

826
01:26:02,908 --> 01:26:03,576
Don't!

827
01:26:16,797 --> 01:26:18,507
Hand closed okay?

828
01:26:18,674 --> 01:26:19,341
Okay?

829
01:26:19,508 --> 01:26:20,426
Wen, please don't hurt me

830
01:26:20,551 --> 01:26:21,302
Beg you, Wen

831
01:26:21,343 --> 01:26:23,012
I ask you close your hand?

832
01:26:23,262 --> 01:26:24,096
Answer I am so good!

833
01:27:25,532 --> 01:27:26,659
never mind

834
01:27:33,707 --> 01:27:39,129
"on Saturday"

835
01:27:43,550 --> 01:27:46,470
Are you going to commit suicide?

836
01:27:47,972 --> 01:27:49,265
how do you know…

837
01:27:49,848 --> 01:27:51,725
I will be safe after your death?

838
01:27:55,062 --> 01:27:56,522
Her goal is me

839
01:28:03,612 --> 01:28:04,989
If I die

840
01:28:05,656 --> 01:28:06,657
She will give up

841
01:28:22,923 --> 01:28:23,674
Belle

842
01:28:31,265 --> 01:28:32,057
Belle...

843
01:28:40,399 --> 01:28:41,692
Why do you do this?

844
01:28:43,944 --> 01:28:44,695
mom

845
01:28:45,362 --> 01:28:45,904
shell…

846
01:28:49,283 --> 01:28:49,992
Belle...

847
01:28:50,826 --> 01:28:53,912
Please don't do that

848
01:28:54,747 --> 01:28:55,706
Belle

849
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:58,542
Why do you do this?

850
01:28:58,625 --> 01:29:01,253
You know how much I love you, right?

851
01:29:02,546 --> 01:29:04,048
Please don't bother me

852
01:29:05,007 --> 01:29:07,426
As long as tonight, you may be fine

853
01:29:07,718 --> 01:29:09,094
You may be fine

854
01:29:30,824 --> 01:29:31,867
You are coming, right?

855
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:41,377
Don't scare me, I hate it

856
01:29:41,668 --> 01:29:43,128
If you want me to die, take me away

857
01:29:43,879 --> 01:29:45,506
Let my mother let it go!

858
01:30:27,256 --> 01:30:27,881
Hey?

859
01:30:28,132 --> 01:30:29,007
Which building?

860
01:30:29,049 --> 01:30:30,717
Abandoned Sathorn Building, is it?

861
01:30:30,801 --> 01:30:31,468
Correct

862
01:30:31,885 --> 01:30:33,387
Sathorn building

863
01:30:33,929 --> 01:30:35,681
Please send an ambulance immediately

864
01:30:51,947 --> 01:30:53,949
Belle

865
01:31:20,684 --> 01:31:22,311
Belle...

866
01:31:53,550 --> 01:31:54,301
Belle...

867
01:31:57,054 --> 01:31:57,930
Belle!

868
01:32:32,673 --> 01:32:33,423
Belle

869
01:33:35,444 --> 01:33:36,820
Tonight will die!

870
01:33:36,945 --> 01:33:38,280
I want to die because of you!

871
01:33:56,715 --> 01:33:57,382
Belle...

872
01:33:58,258 --> 01:33:58,967
Belle!

873
01:34:07,934 --> 01:34:08,602
Belle...

874
01:34:26,161 --> 01:34:26,745
Belle...

875
01:34:30,207 --> 01:34:30,832
Belle

876
01:34:38,965 --> 01:34:39,508
instrument

877
01:34:40,092 --> 01:34:41,760
Instrument, don't do this

878
01:34:41,843 --> 01:34:42,803
I beg you

879
01:34:48,058 --> 01:34:49,518
Don't let me die alone

880
01:34:50,227 --> 01:34:51,228
promise me

881
01:34:52,396 --> 01:34:53,021
instrument!

882
01:34:53,105 --> 01:34:55,190
instrument! Don't!

883
01:34:55,482 --> 01:34:56,525
happy Birthday

884
01:34:56,900 --> 01:34:57,984
Instrument, stop hand!

885
01:34:58,026 --> 01:34:58,985
Don't!

886
01:35:22,008 --> 01:35:22,551
Belle!

887
01:35:22,592 --> 01:35:23,510
stop!

888
01:35:23,593 --> 01:35:24,302
Belle!

889
01:35:25,011 --> 01:35:26,722
Give me the gun!

890
01:35:34,646 --> 01:35:35,522
Don't!

891
01:35:49,244 --> 01:35:49,953
instrument

892
01:35:50,787 --> 01:35:52,289
I bet you dare not shoot at me

893
01:35:52,831 --> 01:35:54,124
bring it on! Kill me!

894
01:35:54,166 --> 01:35:55,083
shot!

895
01:36:54,810 --> 01:36:55,894
Belle

896
01:38:28,612 --> 01:38:29,362
Belle

897
01:38:29,779 --> 01:38:31,072
Belle, can you hear it?

898
01:38:45,128 --> 01:38:45,754
Belle

899
01:38:45,879 --> 01:38:47,631
never mind

900
01:38:47,672 --> 01:38:49,090
Someone will come to save you right away

901
01:38:49,382 --> 01:38:51,468
You have to withstand

902
01:38:51,635 --> 01:38:52,969
Help!

903
01:38:53,219 --> 01:38:54,471
Help!

904
01:38:54,930 --> 01:38:56,473
Help!

905
01:39:05,190 --> 01:39:07,192
Bullet removed

906
01:39:09,110 --> 01:39:11,112
However, the injured brain was seriously injured

907
01:39:12,572 --> 01:39:16,076
Patients must rely on equipment to survive

908
01:39:17,118 --> 01:39:19,287
Even if you choose to continue treatment

909
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:22,415
The patient can't fully recover

910
01:40:23,560 --> 01:40:24,686
I am sorry

911
01:40:26,229 --> 01:40:28,064
Let you wait so long

912
01:41:50,605 --> 01:41:53,817
Belle

913
01:42:14,712 --> 01:42:15,630
instrument

914
01:42:16,714 --> 01:42:18,925
Really sorry

915
01:42:20,718 --> 01:42:22,804
We will meet again one day

916
01:42:27,183 --> 01:42:28,726
But not like this

917
01:42:33,064 --> 01:42:34,566
anyway…

918
01:42:38,069 --> 01:42:39,821
I will not commit suicide

919
01:42:41,364 --> 01:42:45,368
Belle

920
01:42:53,209 --> 01:42:55,211
I fulfilled my promise

921
01:43:06,222 --> 01:43:08,683
Belle, you can't give up

922
01:43:50,308 --> 01:43:52,143
Miss Pa, everything okay?

923
01:44:03,196 --> 01:44:05,406
I just heard about your daughter

924
01:44:05,573 --> 01:44:06,616
Unfortunately

925
01:44:09,327 --> 01:44:10,161
Conscious

926
01:44:11,454 --> 01:44:13,164
This box was originally placed in the closet

927
01:44:13,164 --> 01:44:14,624
Do you want to take it?

928
01:44:16,167 --> 01:44:17,001
thank you

929
01:44:38,856 --> 01:44:41,276
Hello, Miss Palin, can you hear it?

930
01:44:42,777 --> 01:44:43,820
I'm Belle

931
01:44:44,904 --> 01:44:45,780
I don't know

932
01:44:45,822 --> 01:44:48,574
What happens to my birthday?

933
01:44:50,118 --> 01:44:52,870
But I want to tell you I love you

934
01:44:57,625 --> 01:44:59,669
I love you all over the world

935
01:45:01,796 --> 01:45:03,589
But you must be strong

936
01:45:04,173 --> 01:45:07,510
I hope you feel happy every time I think of it

937
01:45:10,138 --> 01:45:12,223
Even though I may not be with you

938
01:45:13,891 --> 01:45:16,102
I will always guard you far

939
01:45:19,522 --> 01:45:21,858
Sorry for using your cassette to bring recordings

940
01:45:21,899 --> 01:45:23,192
That's it, Mom

941
01:45:23,234 --> 01:45:24,068
Goodbye

942
01:45:28,448 --> 01:45:29,490
Let me help

943
01:45:30,491 --> 01:45:31,826
You come back early

944
01:45:33,703 --> 01:45:37,081
I changed my diaper and fed her twice with a syringe

945
01:45:38,249 --> 01:45:39,709
Trouble you

946
01:45:40,209 --> 01:45:41,169
You're welcome

947
01:45:42,045 --> 01:45:44,005
I'll go first and see you next time

948
01:45:50,053 --> 01:45:51,721
How are you, good girl?

949
01:45:53,848 --> 01:45:57,393
Do you know what I found today?

950
01:46:02,482 --> 01:46:03,191
look

951
01:46:04,484 --> 01:46:06,361
Who allows you to bring this cassette recording?

952
01:46:06,694 --> 01:46:08,780
This is Platinum Edition

953
01:46:09,030 --> 01:46:10,573
I can't find it now

954
01:46:17,622 --> 01:46:19,082
Thank you anyway

955
01:46:23,211 --> 01:46:24,837
I will always be strong

956
01:46:29,550 --> 01:46:31,302
Belle, please get well soon

957
01:46:39,102 --> 01:46:40,478
I'll pour water to you

958
01:46:48,694 --> 01:46:50,530
Why are you holding my hand tight?

959
01:46:51,072 --> 01:46:52,198
Don't want me to go?

960
01:47:00,581 --> 01:47:01,290
Belle?

961
01:47:05,711 --> 01:47:07,255
Belle, can you hear it?

962
01:47:12,510 --> 01:47:13,886
If you can hear it

963
01:47:15,847 --> 01:47:17,932
Just squeeze my hand twice
